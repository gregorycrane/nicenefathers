<head>ANF08. The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and
Epistles, The Clementia, Apocrypha, Decretals,
Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents, Remains
of the First Age</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. These
writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for
good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging.
These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing
the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-
Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to
one's reading list.

<head>Introductory Notice.</head>
<p>This volume completes the American series, according to our agreement. But it will be
found to afford much material over and above what was promised, and the editorial labour
it has exacted has been much greater than might at first be suspected. The Bibliography
with which the work is supplemented, and which is the original work of Dr. Riddle, has
been necessarily thrown into the Index by the overgrowth of this volume in original matter.</p>
<p>The Apocryphal works of the Edinburgh collection have been here brought together,
and “Fragments” have been sifted, and arranged on a plan strictly practical. To my valued
collaborator Dr. Riddle I have committed a task which demanded a specialist of his eminent
qualifications. He has had, almost exclusively, the task of editing the Pseudo-Clementina
and the Apocryphal New Testament. To myself I assigned the Twelve Patriarchs and Excerpts,
the Edessene Memoirs and other Syriac Fragments, the False Decretals, and the Remains of
the First Ages. I have reserved this retrospect of historic truth and testimony to complete
the volume. As in music the tune ends on the note with which it began, so, after the greater
part of the volume had been surrendered to forgery and fiction (valuable, indeed, for purposes
of comparison and reference, but otherwise unworthy of a place among primitive witnesses),
I felt it refreshing to return to genuine writings and to authentic histories. The pages of
Melito and others will restore something of the flavour of the Apostolic Fathers to our taste,
and the student will not close his review of the Ante-Nicene Fathers with last impressions
derived only from their fraudulent imitators and corrupters.</p>
<p>The editor-in-chief renews his grateful acknowledgments to those who have aided him
in his undertaking, with whose honoured names the reader is already acquainted. Nor can
he omit an expression of thanks to the reverend brother1 to whom the hard work of the
Indexes has been chiefly committed. It would be equally unjust not to mention his obligations
to the meritorious press which has produced these pages with a general accuracy not easily
ensured under difficulties such as have been inseparable from this undertaking.2 The support
which has been liberally afforded to the enterprise by Christians of divers names and communions
ought not to be recognised by words of mere recognition: it is a token of their
common interest in a common origin, and a sign, perhaps, of a longing for that precious
unity and brotherhood which was the glory of the martyr ages, for which all should unite
in praise to God. To the Christian press a grateful tribute is due from the editor and his
publishers alike; more especially as it has encouraged, so generally, the production of another
series, of which the first volume has already appeared, and which will familiarize the minds

and hearts of thousands with the living thought and burning piety of those great doctors of
the post-Nicene period, to whom the world owes such immense obligations, but who have
been so largely unknown to millions even of educated men, except as bright and shining
names.</p>
<p>It is a cheering token, that, while the superficial popular mind may even be disposed to
regard this collection as a mere museum of fossils, having little or no connection with anything
that interests our age, there is a twofold movement towards a fresh investigation of
the past, which it seems providentially designed to meet. Thus, among Christians there is
a general appetite for the study of primitive antiquity, stimulated by the decadence of the
Papacy, and by the agitations concerning the theology of the future which have arisen in
Reformed communions; while, on the other hand, scientific thought has pushed inquiry as
to the sources of the world’s enlightenment, and has found them just here,—in the school
of Alexandria, and in the Christian writers of the first three centuries. “It is instructive,”
says a forcible thinker,3 and a disciple of Darwin and Huxley, “to note how closely Athanasius
approaches the confines of modern scientific thought.” And again he says: “The intellectual
atmosphere of Alexandria for two centuries before and three centuries after the time
of Christ was more modern than anything that followed, down to the days of Bacon and
Descartes.”</p>
<p>It would be unmanly in the editor to speak of the difficulties and hindrances through
which he has been forced to push on his work, while engaged in other and very sacred duties.
The conditions which alone could justify the publishers in the venture were quite inconsistent
with such an editorial performance as might satisfy his own ideas of what should be done
with such materials. Four years instead of two, he felt, should be bestowed on such a work;
and he thought that two years might suffice only in case a number of collaborators could
be secured for simultaneous employment. When it was found that such a plan was impracticable,
and that the idea must be abandoned if not undertaken and carried forward as it
has been, then the writer most reluctantly assumed his great responsibility in the fear of
God, and in dependence on His lovingkindness and tender mercy. Of the result, he can
only say that “he has done what he could” in the circumstances. He is rewarded by the
consciousness that at least he has enabled many an American divine and scholar to avail
himself of the labours of the Edinburgh translators, and to feel what is due to them, when,
but for this publication, he must have remained in ignorance of what their erudition has
achieved and contributed to Christian learning in the English tongue.</p>
<p>And how sweet and invigorating has been his task, as page after page of these treasures
of antiquity has passed under his hand and eye! With unfailing appetite he has risen before
daylight to his work; and far into the night he has extended it, with ever fresh interest and

<pb n="5"/>
delight. Obliged very often to read his proofs, or prepare his notes, at least in their first
draught, while journeying by land or by water, he has generally found in such employments,
not additional fatigue, but a real comfort and resource, a balance to other cares, and a sweet
preparation and invigoration for other labours. Oh, how much he owes, under God, to
these “guides, philosophers, and friends,”—these Fathers of old time,—and to “their Father
and our Father, their God and our God”! What love is due from all who love Christ, for the
words they have spoken, and the deeds they have done, to assure us that the Everlasting
Word is He to whom alone we can go for the words of life eternal!</p>

<head>THE TESTAMENTS OF THE TWELVE PATRIARCHS.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="7"/>
<head>Introductory Notice
to
The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.</head>
<p>This very curious fragment of antiquity deserves a few words in anticipation of the
translator’s valuable preface. Grabe’s Spicilegium is there referred to; but it may be well also
to consult his citations, in elucidation, of Bull’s Defensio Fidei Nicænæ,4 where he treats the
work with respect. My most valued authority, however, on this subject, is Lardner,5 who
gives a very full account of the work with his usual candor and learning. He seems to treat
the matter with a needless profusion of space and consideration; yet in a much later volume
of his great treatise he recurs to the subject6 with expressions of satisfaction that he had
dealt with it so largely before.</p>
<p>Cave placed the composition of the Testaments about a.d. 192, but concedes a much
earlier origin to the first portion of the work. Origen quotes from it, and Tertullian is supposed
to have borrowed from it one of his expositions, as will be noted in its place. Lardner
clears it from charges of Ebionitism,7 but thinks the author was so far in accord with that
heresy as to use expressions savouring of “Unitarianism.” Of this charge he is not justly
susceptible, it appears to me: quite otherwise. If we can imagine Trypho coming to the
light after his kindly parting with Justin,8 I can conceive of such a man as the author of this
work. He is a Christian awakening to the real purport of the Old-Testament Scriptures, and
anxious to lead rather than drive his brethren after the flesh to the discovery of Him “concerning
whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write:” not a “Judaizing Christian,”
as Cave imagined, but the reverse,—a Christianizing Jew. Now, I must think that such a
writer would weave into his plan many accepted traditions of the Jews and many Rabbinical
expositions of the sacred writers. He was doubtless acquainted with that remarkable passage
in the Revelation in which the patriarchs are so honourably named,9 and with that corresponding
passage which seems to unite the twelve patriarchs with the twelve apostles.10 St.

Paul’s claim for the twelve tribes before Agrippa11 would naturally impress itself on such a
mind. Whether the product of such a character with such a disposition would naturally be
such an affectionate and filial attempt as this to identify the religion of the Crucified with
the faith of the Jewish fathers,12 may be judged of by my reader.</p>
<p>It appears to me an ill-advised romance; not more a “pious fraud” than several fictions
which have attracted attention in our own times, based on the traditions of the Hebrews.
The legends of the “Wandering Jew” have grown out of corresponding instincts among
Christians. To me they appear like the profane “Passion-plays” lately revived among
Christians,—a most unwarrantable form of teaching even truth. But as to the work itself,
seeing it exists, I must acknowledge that it seems to me a valuable relic of antiquity, and an
interesting specimen of the feelings and convictions of those believers over whom St. James
presided in Jerusalem:13 “Israelites indeed,” but “zealous of the law.” They were now convinced
that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, with Moses and all the prophets, looked for the
Messiah who had appeared in Jesus of Nazareth. The author of this book was anxious to
show that the twelve patriarchs were twelve believers in the Paschal Lamb, and that they
died in Christian penitence and faith.</p>
<p>He, then, who will read or study the following waif of the olden time, as I have done,
will not find it unprofitable reading. It really supplies a key to some difficulties in the
Scripture narrative. It suggests what are at least plausible counterparts of what is written.
“To the pure all things are pure;” and I see nothing that need defile in any of the details
which expose the sins, and magnify the penitence, of the patriarchs. In fact, Lardner’s objection
to one of the sections in the beautiful narrative of Joseph strikes me as extraordinary.
It is the story of a heroic conflict with temptation, the like of which was doubtless not uncommon
in the days of early Christians living among heathens;14 and I think it was possibly
written to inspire a Joseph-like chastity in Christian youth. “I do not suppose,” says Lardner,
“that the virtue of any of these ancient Hebrews was complete according to the Christian
rule.” I am amazed at this; I have always supposed the example of Joseph the more glorious

because he flourished as the flower of chastity in a gross and carnal age. Who so pure as he
save John the Baptist, that morning star that shone so near the Sun of Righteousness in the
transient beauty of his “heliacal rising”? Surely Joseph was a type of Christ in this as in
other particulars, and our author merely enables us to understand the “fiery darts” which
he was wont to hurl back at the tempter. I own (reluctantly, because I dislike this form of
teaching) that for me the superlative ode of the dying Jacob receives a reflected lustre from
this curious book, especially in the splendid eulogy with which the old patriarch blesses his
beloved Joseph. “The author,” says Lardner, “in an indirect manner…bears a large testimony
to the Christian religion, to the facts, principles, and books of the New Testament. He speaks
of the nativity of Christ, the meekness and unblameableness of His life, His crucifixion at
the instigation of the Jewish priests, the wonderful concomitants of His death, His resurrection,
and ascension. He represents the character of the Messiah as God and man: the Most
High God with men, eating and drinking with them; the Son of God; the Saviour of the
world, of the Gentiles and Israel; as Eternal High Priest and King. He likewise speaks of the
effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the Messiah, attended with a voice from heaven; His unrighteous
treatment by the Jews; their desolations and the destruction of the Temple upon
that account; the call of the Gentiles; the illuminating them generally with new light; the
effusion of the Spirit upon believers, but especially, and in a more abundant measure, upon
the Gentiles.…There are allusions to the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. Luke and St. John, the
Acts of the Apostles, and of the Epistles to Ephesians, First Thessalonians, First Timothy,
Hebrews, and First St. John, also to the Revelation. So far as consistent with the assumed
character of his work, the author declares the canonical authority of the Acts of the Apostles
and the Epistles of St. Paul.” Of which of the minor writers among the Ante-Nicene Fathers
can so much be said?</p>
<p>Regarded as a sort of Jewish surrender to Justin’s argument with Trypho, this book is
interesting, and represents, no doubt, the convictions of thousands of Jewish converts of
the first age. It is, in short, worthy of more attention than it has yet received.</p>
<p>Here follows Mr. Sinker’s valuable Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The apocryphal work known as the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs professes to be,
as its name implies, the utterances of the dying patriarchs, the sons of Jacob. In these they
give some account of their lives, embodying particulars not found in the scriptural account,
and build thereupon various moral precepts for the guidance of their descendants. The
book partakes also of the nature of an Apocalypse: the patriarchs see in the future their
children doing wickedly, stained with the sins of every nation; and thus they foretell the
troubles impending on their race. Still at last God will put an end to their woe, and comfort
is found in the promise of a Messiah</p>

<pb n="10"/>
<p>There can be little or no doubt that the author was a Jew, who, having been converted
to Christianity, sought to win over his countrymen to the same faith, and thus employed
the names of the patriarchs as a vehicle for conveying instruction to their descendants, as
winning by this means for his teaching at any rate a prima facie welcome in the eyes of the
Jewish people.</p>
<p>It does not seem hard to settle approximately the limits of time within which the book
was probably written. It cannot be placed very late in the second century, seeing that it is
almost certainly quoted by Tertullian,15 and that Origen16 cites the Testaments by name,
apparently indeed holding it in considerable respect. We can, however, approximate much
more nearly than this; for the allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem assign to the Testaments
a date subsequent to that event. This will harmonize perfectly with what is the natural
inference from several passages,—namely, that the Gentiles now were a majority in the
Church,—as well as with the presence of the many formulæ to express the incarnation, and
with the apparent collection of the books of the New Testament into a volume.17</p>
<p>On the other hand, important evidence as to the posterior limit of the date of writing
may be derived from the language used with reference to the priesthood. Christ is both
High Priest and King, and His former office is higher than the latter, and to Him the old
priesthood must resign its rights. Now such language as this would be almost meaningless
after Hadrian’s destruction of Jerusalem consequent on the revolt of Bar-Cochba (a.d. 135),
after which all power of Judaism for acting directly upon Christianity ceased; and, indeed,
on the hypothesis of a later date, we should doubtless find allusions to the revolt and its
suppression. On the above grounds, we infer that the writing of the Testaments is to be
placed in a period ranging from late in the first century to the revolt of Bar-Cochba; closer
than this it is perhaps not safe to draw our limits.18</p>
<p>The language in which the Testaments were written was no doubt the Hellenistic Greek
in which we now possess them; presenting as they do none of the peculiar marks which
characterize a version. Whether there were a Hebrew work on which the present was
modelled—a supposition by no means improbable in itself—we cannot tell, nor is it a matter
of much importance. The phenomena of the book itself may be cited in support of this
conclusion: for instance, the use of the word διαθήκη in its ordinary classical meaning of
“testament,” not “covenant” as in Hellenistic Greek, for which former meaning there would
be no strictly equivalent word in Hebrew; the numerous instances of paronomasia, such as

expressions pertaining to the Greek philosophy, as διάθεσις, αἴσθησις, φύσις, τέλος.</p>
<p>It seems doubtful how far we can attempt with safety to determine accurately the religious
standpoint of the writer beyond the obvious fact of his Jewish origin, though some have at-
tempted to show that he was a Nazarene, and others a Jewish Christian of Pauline tendencies.
We shall therefore content ourselves with referring those who seek for more specific information
on this point to the works mentioned below.</p>
<p>To refer now briefly to the external history of our document, we meet with nothing
definite, after its citation by Origen, for many centuries: there are possible allusions in
Jerome24 and in Procopius Gazæus;25 there is also a mention of πατριάρχαι in the Synopsis
Sacræ Scripturæ found among the writings of Athanasius, as well as in the Stichometria of
Nicephorus of Constantinople, on which it is probably based. Again, in the Canons of the
Council of Rome (494 a.d.) under Gelasius, and of the Council of Bracara (563 a.d.), are
possible references, though it is far from improbable that in some of the foregoing passages
the reference may be to a writing τῶν τριῶν Πατριαρχῶν alluded to in the Apostolic Constitutions,
26 or is even of somewhat loose application.</p>
<p>After this a blank ensues until the middle of the thirteenth century, when it was brought
to the knowledge of Western Europe by Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, the earliest
of the great English reformers.27 We cite here the account of the matter given by Matthew
Paris, although of course we need not accept all the opinions of the old chronicler respecting
the document in question: “At this same time, Robert, Bishop of Lincoln, a man most deeply
versed in Latin and Greek, accurately translated the Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs from
Greek into Latin. These had been for a long time unknown and hidden through the jealousy
of the Jews, on account of the prophecies of the Saviour contained in them. The Greeks,
however, the most unwearied investigators of all writings, were the first to come to a
knowledge of this document, and translated it from Hebrew into Greek, and have kept it to
themselves till our times. And neither in the time of the blessed Jerome nor of any other

holy interpreter could the Christians gain an acquaintance with it, through the malice of
the ancient Jews. This glorious treatise, then, the aforesaid bishop (with the help of Master
Nicolaus, a Greek, and a clerk of the Abbey of St. Alban’s) translated fully and clearly, and
word for word, from Greek into Latin, to the strengthening of the Christian faith, and to
the greater confusion of the Jews.”28</p>
<p>Again, after speaking of the death of “Master John de Basingstokes, Archdeacon of
Leicester,” a man of very great learning in Latin and Greek, he proceeds:29 “This Master
John had mentioned to Robert, Bishop of Lincoln, that when he was studying at Athens he
had seen and heard from learned Greek doctors certain things unknown to the Latins.
Among these he found the Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs, that is to say, of the sons of
Jacob. Now it is plain that these really form part of the sacred volume, but have been long
hidden through the jealousy of the Jews, on account of the evident prophecies about Christ
which are clearly seen in them. Consequently this same bishop sent into Greece; and when
he obtained them, he translated them from Greek into Latin, as well as certain other things.”</p>
<p>After this it would seem as though the same fate still pursued our document, for the
entire Greek text was not printed until the eve of the eighteenth century, when it was published
for the first time by Grabe, whose edition has been several times reprinted.30</p>
<p>Four Greek mss. of the Testaments are known to exist:—</p>
<p>1. The ms. Ff. i. 24 in the University Library of Cambridge, to which it was given by
Archbishop Parker, whose autograph it bears on its first page. It is a quarto on parchment,
of 261 leaves (in which the Testaments occupy ff. 203a–261b), double columns, 20 lines in
a column, handwriting of the tenth century. It is furnished with accents and breathings,
and a fairly full punctuation. There are very strong grounds for believing that it was this
ms. that Grosseteste’s version was made, exhibiting as it does a very large amount of curious
verbal coincidence with it.31 The text of this ms. has been that given in the various editions
mentioned below.</p>
<p>2. The ms. Barocci 133 in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where it came with the rest
of the Barocci collection from Venice, and was presented to the University by its Chancellor,
the Earl of Pembroke. It is a quarto volume; and except a leaf or two of parchment, containing
writing of an older period, consists of a number of treatises on paper, apparently by
several different hands, in the writing of the latter part of the fourteenth century. The
Testaments occupy ff. 179a–203b. The amount of difference between this ms. and the pre-

entire chapters. The variations of this ms. are given more or less fully in the various editions.</p>

yet been published.32</p>
<p>The entire Greek text of the Testaments was first printed by Grabe in his Spicilegium
Patrum et Hæreticorum, Oxford, 1698, professedly from the Cambridge ms., but in reality
from some very inaccurate transcript of it, very possibly from one made by Abednego Seller,
also in the Cambridge University Library, Oo. vi. 92. Grabe also gave a few of the variations
of the Oxford ms. Fabricius, in his Codex Pseudepigraphus Veteris Testamenti,33 gives little
more than a reprint from Grabe. In the second edition of the latter (1714) the true text has
been restored in several passages; but in many places Grosseteste’s Latin version, which
witnessed to the true reading, was altered to suit Grabe’s incorrect text. Fabricius’ second
edition (1722) is perhaps, on the whole, less accurate than his first. Since then the text and
notes, as given in Grabe’s second edition, have been reprinted, with but few additions, by
Gallandi, in his Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum, vol. i. p. 193 sqq., Venice, 1765, and in Migne’s
Patrologia Græca, vol. ii., Paris, 1857. The text of the Cambridge ms. with a full statement
of the variations of the Oxford ms., has recently been edited directly from the mss. by myself,
Cambridge, 1869; from this edition the present translation has been made.</p>
<p>The mss. of Grosseteste’s Latin version are numerous, there being no less than twelve
in Cambridge alone and it has been frequently printed, both with the editions of the Greek
text and independently.34</p>
<p>Besides the Latin version, the Testaments have also been translated into several European
languages, in all cases apparently from the Latin. The English translation made by Arthur
Golding was first printed by John Daye in Aldersgate in 1581, and has since been frequently
reproduced; the British Museum, which does not possess all the editions, having no less
than eleven.35</p>

<head>The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.</head>

<head>I.—The Testament of Reuben Concerning Thoughts.</head>
<p>1. The copy of the Testament of Reuben, what things he charged his sons before he
died in the hundred and twenty-fifth year of his life. When he was sick two years after the
death of Joseph, his sons and his sons’ sons were gathered together to visit him. And he
said to them, My children, I am dying, and go the way of my fathers. And when he saw
there Judah and Gad and Asher, his brethren, he said to them, Raise me up, my brethren,
that I may tell to my brethren and to my children what things I have hidden in my heart,
for from henceforth my strength faileth me. And he arose and kissed them, and said,
weeping: Hear, my brethren, give ear to Reuben your father, what things I command you.
And, behold, I call to witness against you this day the God of heaven, that ye walk not in
the ignorance of youth and fornication wherein I ran greedily, and I defiled the bed of Jacob
my father. For I tell you that He smote me with a sore plague in my loins for seven months;
and had not Jacob our father prayed for me to the Lord, surely the Lord would have destroyed
me. For I was thirty years old when I did this evil in the sight of the Lord, and for seven
months I was sick even unto death; and I repented for seven years in the set purpose of my
soul before the Lord. Wine and strong drink I drank not, and flesh entered not into my
mouth, and I tasted not pleasant food,39 mourning over my sin, for it was great. And it
shall not so be done in Israel.</p>
<p>2. And now hear me, my children, what things I saw in my repentance concerning the
seven spirits of error. Seven spirits are given against man from Beliar, and they are chief of
the works of youth; and seven spirits are given to him at his creation, that in them should
be done every work of man.40 The first (1) spirit is of life, with which man’s whole being
is created. The second (2) spirit is of sight, with which ariseth desire. The third (3) spirit
is of hearing, with which cometh teaching. The fourth (4) spirit is of smelling, with which
taste is given to draw air and breath. The fifth (5) spirit is of speech, with which cometh
knowledge. The sixth (6) spirit is of taste, with which cometh the eating of meats and drinks;
and by them strength is produced, for in food is the foundation of strength. The seventh
<note type="footnote">39 There seems a reminiscence here of the words of Dan. x. 3, LXX. [For proofs of penitence, see p. 11, note
3, infra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">40 For this use of πνεύματα as applied to the senses, we may cite Plutarch (De placitis philosophorum, iv. 21),
who, speaking with reference to the Stoic philosophy, says, ἡ μὲν ὅρασις ἐστὶ πνεῦμα διατεινον ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἡγεμονικοῦ μέχρις ὀφθαλμῶν.</note>

<pb n="16"/>
(7) spirit is of begetting and sexual intercourse, with which through love of pleasure sin also
entereth in: wherefore it is the last in order of creation, and the first of youth, because it is
filled with ignorance, which leadeth the young as a blind man to a pit, and as cattle to a
precipice.</p>
<p>3. Besides all these, there is an eighth (8) spirit of sleep, with which is created entrancement
of man’s nature, and the image of death. With these spirits are mingled the spirits of
error. The first (1), the spirit of fornication, dwelleth in the nature and in the senses; the
second (2) spirit of insatiateness in the belly; the third (3) spirit of fighting in the liver and
the gall. The fourth (4) is the spirit of fawning and trickery, that through over-officiousness
a man may be fair in seeming. The fifth (5) is the spirit of arrogance, that a man may be
stirred up and become high-minded. The sixth (6) is the spirit of lying, in perdition and in
jealousy to feign words, and to conceal41 words from kindred and friends. The seventh (7)
is the spirit of injustice, with which are theft and pilferings, that a man may work the desire
of his heart; for injustice worketh together with the other spirits by means of craft. Besides
all these, the spirit of sleep, the eighth (8) spirit, is conjoined with error and fantasy. And
so perisheth every young man, darkening his mind from the truth, and not understanding
the law of God, nor obeying the admonitions of his fathers, as befell me also in my youth.</p>
<p>And now, children, love the truth, and it shall preserve you. I counsel you, hear ye Reuben
your father. Pay no heed to the sight of a woman, nor yet associate privately with a
female under the authority of a husband, nor meddle with affairs of womankind. For had
I not seen Bilhah bathing in a covered place, I had not fallen into this great iniquity.42 For
my mind, dwelling on the woman’s nakedness, suffered me not to sleep until I had done
the abominable deed. For while Jacob our father was absent with Isaac his father, when we
were in Gader, near to Ephratha in Bethlehem, Bilhah was drunk, and lay asleep uncovered
in her chamber; and when I went in and beheld her nakedness, I wrought that impiety, and
leaving her sleeping I departed. And forthwith an angel of God revealed to my father Jacob
concerning my impiety, and he came and mourned over me, and touched her no more.43</p>
<p>4. Pay no heed, therefore, to the beauty of women, and muse not upon their doings;
but walk in singleness of heart in the fear of the Lord, and be labouring in works, and
roaming in study and among your flocks, until the Lord give to you a wife whom He will,
that ye suffer not as I did. Until my father’s death I had not boldness to look stedfastly into
the face of Jacob, or to speak to any of my brethren, because of my reproach; and even until
now my conscience afflicteth me by reason of my sin. And my father comforted me; for he

prayed for me unto the Lord, that the anger of the Lord might pass away from me, even as
the Lord showed me. From henceforth, then, I was protected, and I sinned not. Therefore,
my children, observe all things whatsoever I command you, and ye shall not sin. For fornication
is the destruction of the soul, separating it from God, and bringing it near to idols,
because it deceiveth the mind and understanding, and bringeth down young men into hell
before their time. For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or
noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men. For
in that Joseph kept himself from every woman, and purged his thoughts from all fornication,
he found favour before the Lord and men. For the Egyptian woman did many things unto
him, and called for magicians, and offered him love potions, and the purpose of his soul
admitted no evil desire. Therefore the God of my fathers delivered him from every visible
and hidden death. For if fornication overcome not the mind, neither shall Beliar overcome
you.</p>
<p>5. Hurtful are women, my children; because, since they have no power or strength over
the man, they act subtilly through outward guise how they may draw him to themselves;
and whom they cannot overcome by strength, him they overcome by craft. For moreover
the angel of God told me concerning them, and taught me that women are overcome by the
spirit of fornication more than men, and they devise in their heart against men; and by
means of their adornment they deceive first their minds, and instil the poison by the glance
of their eye, and then they take them captive by their doings, for a woman cannot overcome
a man by force.</p>
<p>Therefore flee fornication, my children, and command your wives and your daughters
that they adorn not their heads and their faces; because every woman who acteth deceitfully
in these things hath been reserved to everlasting punishment. For thus they allured the
Watchers44 before the flood; and as these continually beheld them, they fell into desire each
of the other, and they conceived the act in their mind, and changed themselves into the
shape of men, and appeared to them in their congress with their husbands; and the women,
having in their minds desire toward their apparitions, gave birth to giants, for the Watchers
appeared to them as reaching even unto heaven.45</p>
<note type="footnote">44 This name, occurring once again in the Testaments (Naph. 3), is one frequently found applied to the angels
as the custodians of the world and of men. Thus, in the Chaldee of Daniel (iv. 10, 14, 20: 13, 17, 23, Eng. Ver.),
we find the expression עִִיר , which Aquila and Symmachus render ἐγρήγορος. The corresponding Ethiopic
term is of frequent occurrence in the book of Enoch, not only of the fallen angels (e.g., x. 9, 15, xvi. 1, etc.), but
of the good (xii. 2, 3, etc., ed. Dillmann). See also Gesenius, Thesaurus, s.v. .עִִיר</note>
<note type="footnote">45 [Gen. vi. 4; Revised margin, 1 Cor. xi. 10; Jude 6, 7.]</note>

<p>6. Beware, therefore, of fornication; and if you wish to be pure in your mind, guard
your senses against every woman. And command them likewise not to company with men,
that they also be pure in their mind. For constant meetings, even though the ungodly deed
be not wrought, are to them an irremediable disease, and to us an everlasting reproach of
Beliar; for fornication hath neither understanding nor godliness in itself, and all jealousy
dwelleth in the desire thereof. Therefore ye will be jealous against the sons of Levi, and will
seek to be exalted over them; but ye shall not be able, for God will work their avenging, and
ye shall die by an evil death. For to Levi the Lord gave the sovereignty, and to Judah,46 and
to me also with them,47 and to Dan and Joseph, that we should be for rulers. Therefore I
command you to hearken to Levi, because he shall know the law of the Lord, and shall give
ordinances for judgment and sacrifice for all Israel until the completion of the times of
Christ, the High Priest whom the Lord hath declared. I adjure you by the God of heaven
to work truth each one with his neighbour; and draw ye near to Levi in humbleness of heart,
that ye may receive a blessing from his mouth. For he shall bless Israel; and specially Judah,
because him hath the Lord chosen to rule over all the peoples. And worship we his Seed,
because He shall die for us in wars visible and invisible, and shall be among you an everlasting
king.</p>
<p>7. And Reuben died after that he had given command to his sons; and they placed him
in a coffin until they bore him up from Egypt, and buried him in Hebron in the double48
cave where his fathers were.</p>

<head>II.—The Testament of Simeon Concerning Envy.</head>
<p>1. The copy of the words of Simeon, what things he spake to his sons before he died,
in the hundred and twentieth year of his life, in the year in which Joseph died. For they
came to visit him when he was sick, and he strengthened himself and sat up and kissed them,
and said to them:—</p>
<p>2. Hear, O my children, hear Simeon your father, what things I have in my heart. I was
born of Jacob my father, his second son; and my mother Leah called me Simeon, because
the Lord heard her prayer.49 I became strong exceedingly; I shrank from no deed, nor was
I afraid of anything. For my heart was hard, and my mind was unmoveable, and my bowels
unfeeling: because valour also has been given from the Most High to men in soul and in
body. And at that time I was jealous of Joseph because our father loved him;50 and I set my
mind against him to destroy him, because the prince of deceit sent forth the spirit of jealousy
and blinded my mind, that I regarded him not as a brother, and spared not Jacob my father.
But his God and the God of his fathers sent forth His angel, and delivered him out of my
hands. For when I went into Shechem to bring ointment for the flocks, and Reuben to
Dotham, where were our necessaries and all our stores, Judah our brother sold him to the
Ishmaelites. And when Reuben came he was grieved, for he wished to have restored him
safe to his father.51 But I was wroth against Judah in that he let him go away alive, and for
five months I continued wrathful against him; but God restrained me, and withheld from
me all working of my hands, for my right hand was half withered for seven days. And I
knew, my children, that because of Joseph this happened to me, and I repented and wept;
and I besought the Lord that He would restore my hand unto me, and that I might be kept
from all pollution and envy, and from all folly. For I knew that I had devised an evil deed
before the Lord and Jacob my father, on account of Joseph my brother, in that I envied him.</p>
<p>3. And now, children, take heed of the spirit of deceit and of envy. For envy ruleth over
the whole mind of a man, and suffereth him neither to eat, nor to drink, nor to do any good
thing: it ever suggesteth to him to destroy him that he envieth; and he that is envied ever
flourisheth, but he that envieth fades away. Two years of days I afflicted my soul with fasting
in the fear of the Lord, and I learnt that deliverance from envy cometh by the fear of God.
<note type="footnote">49 Gen. xxix. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">50 That Simeon was prominent in the hostility to Joseph, is perhaps implied by his detention in Egypt as a
surety for the return of the others; and Jewish tradition generally accords with this view. Cf. the Targum of the
Pseudo-Jonathan on Gen. xxxvii. 19: “Simeon and Levi, who were brothers in counsel, said one to another, Let
us kill him.” Also this same Targum on Gen. xlii. 24: “And he took from them Simeon, who had counselled to
kill him.” Cf. also Breshith Rabba, § 91.</note>
<note type="footnote">51 [Gen. xxxvii. 22, 29; xlii. 22.]</note>

<pb n="20"/>
If a man flee to the Lord, the evil spirit runneth away from him, and his mind becometh
easy. And henceforward he sympathizeth with him whom he envied, and condemneth not
those who love him, and so ceaseth from his envy.</p>
<p>4. And my father asked concerning me, because he saw that I was sad; and I said, I am
pained in my liver. For I mourned more than they all, because I was guilty of the selling of
Joseph. And when we went down into Egypt, and he bound me as a spy, I knew that I was
suffering justly, and I grieved not. Now Joseph was a good man, and had the Spirit of God
within him: compassionate and pitiful, he bore not malice against me; nay, he loved me
even as the rest of his brothers. Take heed, therefore, my children, of all jealousy and envy,
and walk in singleness of soul and with good heart, keeping in mind the brother of your
father, that God may give to you also grace and glory, and blessing upon your heads, even
as ye saw in him. All his days he reproached us not concerning this thing, but loved us as
his own soul, and beyond his own sons; and he glorified us, and gave riches, and cattle, and
fruits freely to us all. Do ye then also, my beloved children, love each one his brother with
a good heart, and remove from you the spirit of envy, for this maketh savage the soul and
destroyeth the body; it turneth his purposes into anger and war, and stirreth up unto blood,
and leadeth the mind into frenzy, and suffereth not prudence to act in men: moreover, it
taketh away sleep, and causeth tumult to the soul and trembling to the body. For even in
sleep some malicious jealousy, deluding him, gnaweth at his soul, and with wicked spirits
disturbeth it, and causeth the body to be troubled, and the mind to awake from sleep in
confusion; and as though having a wicked and poisonous spirit, so appeareth it to men.</p>
<p>5. Therefore was Joseph fair in appearance, and goodly to look upon, because there
dwelt not in him any wickedness; for in trouble of the spirit the face declareth it. And now,
my children, make your hearts good before the Lord, and your ways straight before men,
and ye shall find grace before God and men. And take heed not to commit fornication, for
fornication is mother of all evils, separating from God, and bringing near to Beliar. For I
have seen it inscribed in the writing of Enoch52 that your sons shall with you be corrupted
in fornication, and shall do wrong against Levi with the sword. But they shall not prevail
against Levi, for he shall wage the war of the Lord, and shall conquer all your hosts; and
there shall be a few divided in Levi and Judah, and there shall be none53 of you for sovereignty,
even as also my father Jacob prophesied in his blessings.</p>
<p>6. Behold, I have foretold you all things, that I may be clear from the sin of your souls.
Now, if ye remove from you your envy, and all your stiffneckedness, as a rose shall my bones
flourish in Israel, and as a lily my flesh in Jacob, and my odour shall be as the odour of
Libanus; and as cedars shall holy ones be multiplied from me for ever, and their branches

shall stretch afar off. Then shall perish the seed of Canaan, and a remnant shall not be to
Amalek, and all the Cappadocians54 shall perish, and all the Hittites55 shall be utterly destroyed.
Then shall fail the land of Ham, and every people shall perish. Then shall all the
earth rest from trouble, and all the world under heaven from war. Then shall Shem be
glorified, because the Lord God, the Mighty One of Israel, shall appear upon earth as man,56
and saved by Him Adam.57 Then shall all the spirits of deceit be given to be trampled under
foot, and men shall rule over the wicked spirits. Then will I arise in joy, and will bless the
Most High because of His marvellous works, because God hath taken a body and eaten with
men and saved men.</p>
<p>7. And now, my children, obey Levi, and in Judah shall ye be redeemed:58 and be not
lifted up against these two tribes, for from them shall arise to you the salvation of God. For
the Lord shall raise up from Levi as it were a Priest,59 and from Judah as it were a King, God
and man.60 So shall He save all the Gentiles and the race of Israel. Therefore I command
you all things, in order that ye also may command your children, that they may observe
them throughout their generations.</p>
<p>8. And Simeon made an end of commanding his sons, and slept with his fathers, being
an hundred and twenty years old. And they laid him in a coffin of incorruptible wood, to
take up his bones to Hebron. And they carried them up in a war of the Egyptians secretly:
for the bones of Joseph the Egyptians guarded in the treasure-house of the palace; for the
sorcerers told them that at the departure of the bones of Joseph there should be throughout
the whole of Egypt darkness and gloom, and an exceeding great plague to the Egyptians, so
that even with a lamp a man should not recognise his brother.</p>
<p>9. And the sons of Simeon bewailed their father according to the law of mourning, and
they were in Egypt until the day of their departure from Egypt by the hand of Moses.</p>

<head>III.—The Testament of Levi Concerning the Priesthood and Arrogance.</head>
<p>1. The copy of the words of Levi, what things he appointed to his sons, according to all
that they should do, and what things should befall them until the day of judgment. He was
in sound health when he called them to him, for it had been shown to him that he should
die. And when they were gathered together he said to them:—</p>
<p>2. I Levi was conceived in Haran and born there, and after that I came with my father
to Shechem. And I was young, about twenty years of age, when with Simeon I wrought the
vengeance on Hamor for our sister Dinah. And when we were feeding our flocks in Abel-
Maul, a spirit of understanding of the Lord came upon me,61 and I saw all men corrupting
their way, and that unrighteousness had built to itself walls, and iniquity sat upon towers;
and I grieved for the race of men, and I prayed to the Lord that I might be saved. Then there
fell upon me a sleep, and I beheld a high mountain: this is the mountain of Aspis62 in Abel-
Maul. And behold, the heavens were opened, and an angel of God said to me, Levi, enter.
And I entered from the first heaven into the second, and I saw there water hanging between
the one and the other. And I saw a third heaven far brighter than those two, for there was
in it a height without bounds. And I said to the angel, Wherefore is this? And the angel
said to me, Marvel not at these, for thou shalt see four other heavens brighter than these,
and without comparison, when thou shalt have ascended thither: because thou shalt stand
near the Lord, and shalt be His minister, and shall declare His mysteries to men, and shalt
proclaim concerning Him who shall redeem Israel;63 and by thee and Judah shall the Lord
appear among men, saving in them every race of men; and of the portion of the Lord shall
be thy life, and He shall be thy field and vineyard, fruits, gold, silver.</p>
<p>3. Hear, then, concerning the seven64 heavens. The lowest is for this cause more gloomy,
in that it is near all the iniquities of men. The second hath fire, snow, ice, ready for the day
of the ordinance of the Lord, in the righteous judgment of God: in it are all the spirits of
the retributions for vengeance on the wicked. In the third are the hosts of the armies which
are ordained for the day of judgment, to work vengeance on the spirits of deceit and of
Beliar. And the heavens up to the fourth above these are holy, for in the highest of all
dwelleth the Great Glory, in the holy of holies, far above all holiness. In the heaven next to
it are the angels of the presence of the Lord, who minister and make propitiation to the Lord
for all the ignorances of the righteous; and they offer to the Lord a reasonable sweet-smelling

savour, and a bloodless offering. And in the heaven below this are the angels who bear the
answers to the angels of the presence of the Lord. And in the heaven next to this are thrones,
dominions, in which hymns are ever offered to God. Therefore, whenever the Lord looketh
upon us, all of us are shaken; yea, the heavens, and the earth, and the abysses, are shaken at
the presence of His majesty; but the sons of men, regarding not these things, sin, and provoke

<p>4. Now, therefore, know that the Lord will execute judgment upon the sons of men;
because when the rocks are rent,65 and the sun quenched, and the waters dried up, and the
fire trembling, and all creation troubled, and the invisible spirits melting away, and the
grave66 spoiled in the suffering of the Most High,67 men unbelieving will abide in their
iniquity, therefore with punishment shall they be judged. Therefore the Most High hath
heard thy prayer, to separate thee from iniquity, and that thou shouldest become to Him a
son, and a servant, and a minister of His presence. A shining light of knowledge shalt thou
shine in Jacob, and as the sun shalt thou be to all the seed of Israel. And a blessing shall be
given to thee, and to all thy seed, until the Lord shall visit all the heathen in the tender
mercies of His Son, even for ever. Nevertheless thy sons shall lay hands upon Him to crucify
Him; and therefore have counsel and understanding been given thee, that thou mightest
instruct thy sons concerning Him, because he that blesseth Him shall be blessed, but they
that curse Him shall perish.</p>
<p>5. And the angel opened to me the gates of heaven, and I saw the holy temple, and the
Most High upon a throne of glory. And He said to me, Levi, I have given thee the blessings
of the priesthood until that I shall come and sojourn in the midst of Israel. Then the angel
brought me to the earth, and gave me a shield and a sword, and said, Work vengeance on
Shechem because of Dinah, and I will be with thee, because the Lord hath sent me. And I
destroyed at that time the sons of Hamor, as it is written in the heavenly tablets.68 And I
said to Him, I pray Thee, O Lord, tell me Thy name, that I may call upon Thee in a day of
tribulation. And He said, I am the angel who intercedeth for the race of Israel, that He smite

course of the future, is one often appealed to in Apocalyptic literature, when some oracular declaration of weighty

the dying Enoch tells his children that the tablets are the source of all understanding, etc. (see, e.g., cc. 81. 1; 93.
2; 106. 19, ed. Dillmann). In the Book of Jubilees, again, it is said that inscribed on the tablets are, e.g., the
punishment of the angels who sinned with mortal women, the plan of the division of weeks, the name of Abraham
as the friend of God, etc. (cc. 5, 6, 19). See also Test. Asher, 2, 7, infra.</note>

them not utterly, because every evil spirit attacketh it. And after these things I was as it were
awaked, and blessed the Most High, and the angel that intercedeth for the race of Israel, and
for all the righteous.69</p>
<p>6. And when I came to my father I found a brazen shield;70 wherefore also the name
of the mountain is Aspis, which is near Gebal, on the right side of Abila; and I kept these
words in my heart. I took counsel with my father, and with Reuben my brother, that he
should bid the sons of Hamor that they should be circumcised; for I was jealous because of
the abomination which they had wrought in Israel. And I slew Shechem at the first, and
Simeon slew Hamor. And after this our brethren came and smote the city with the edge of
the sword; and our father heard it and was wroth, and he was grieved in that they had received
the circumcision, and after that had been put to death, and in his blessings he dealt otherwise
with us. For we sinned because we had done this thing against his will, and he was sick upon
that day. But I knew that the sentence of God was for evil upon Shechem; for they sought
to do to Sarah as they did to Dinah our sister, and the Lord hindered them. And so they
persecuted Abraham our father when he was a stranger, and they harried his flocks when
they were multiplied upon him; and Jeblae his servant, born in his house, they shamefully
handled. And thus they did to all strangers, taking away their wives by force, and the men
themselves driving into exile. But the wrath of the Lord came suddenly upon them to the
uttermost.71</p>
<p>7. And I said to my father, Be not angry, sir, because by thee will the Lord bring to
nought the Canaanites, and will give their land to thee, and to thy seed after thee. For from
this day forward shall Shechem be called a city of them that are without understanding; for
as a man mocketh at a fool, so did we mock them, because they wrought folly in Israel to
defile our sister. And we took our sister from thence, and departed, and came to Bethel.</p>
<p>8. And there I saw a thing again even as the former, after we had passed seventy days.
And I saw seven men in white raiment saying to me, Arise, put on the robe of the priesthood,
and the crown of righteousness, and the breastplate of understanding, and the garment of
truth, and the diadem of faith, and the tiara of miracle, and the ephod of prophecy.72 And

each one of them bearing each of these things put them on me, and said, From henceforth
become a priest of the Lord, thou and thy seed for ever. And the first anointed me with
holy oil, and gave to me the rod of judgment. The second washed me with pure water, and
fed me with bread and wine, the most holy things,73 and clad me with a holy and glorious
robe. The third clothed me with a linen vestment like to an ephod. The fourth put round
me a girdle like unto purple. The fifth gave to me a branch of rich olive. The sixth placed
a crown on my head. The seventh placed on my head a diadem of priesthood, and filled
my hands with incense, so that I served as a priest to the Lord. And they said to me, Levi,
thy seed shall be divided into three branches,74 for a sign of the glory of the Lord who is to
come; and first shall he be that hath been faithful; no portion shall be greater than his. The
second shall be in the priesthood. The third—a new name shall be called over Him, because
He shall arise as King from Judah, and shall establish a new priesthood, after the fashion of
the Gentiles, to all the Gentiles.75 And His appearing shall be unutterable, as of an exalted76
prophet of the seed of Abraham our father. Every desirable thing in Israel shall be for thee
and for thy seed, and everything fair to look upon shall ye eat, and the table of the Lord shall
thy seed apportion, and some of them shall be high priests, and judges, and scribes; for by
their mouth shall the holy place be guarded. And when I awoke, I understood that this
thing was like unto the former. And I hid this also in my heart, and told it not to any man
upon the earth.</p>
<p>9. And after two days I and Judah went up to Isaac after77 our father; and the father of
my father blessed me according to all the words of the visions which I had seen: and he
would not come with us to Bethel. And when we came to Bethel, my father Jacob saw in a
vision concerning me, that I should be to them for a priest unto the Lord; and he rose up
early in the morning, and paid tithes of all to the Lord through me. And we came to Hebron
to dwell there, and Isaac called me continually to put me in remembrance of the law of the
Lord, even as the angel of God showed to me. And he taught me the law of the priesthood,
of sacrifices, whole burnt-offerings, first-fruits, free-will offerings, thank-offerings. And

each day he was instructing me, and was busied for me before the Lord. And he said to me,
Take heed, my child, of the spirit of fornication; for this shall continue, and shall by thy seed
pollute the holy things. Take therefore to thyself, while yet thou art young, a wife, not having
blemish, nor yet polluted, nor of the race of the Philistines or Gentiles. And before entering
into the holy place, bathe;78 and when thou offerest the sacrifice, wash; and again when thou
finishest the sacrifice, wash. Of twelve trees ever having leaves, offer up the fruits to the
Lord, as also Abraham taught me; and of every clean beast and clean bird offer a sacrifice
to the Lord, and of every firstling and of wine offer first-fruits; and every sacrifice thou shalt
salt with salt.79</p>
<p>10. Now, therefore, observe whatsoever I command you, children; for whatsoever things
I have heard from my fathers I have made known to you. I am clear from all your ungodliness
and transgression which ye will do in the end of the ages against the Saviour of the world,
acting ungodly, deceiving Israel, and raising up against it great evils from the Lord.80 And
ye will deal lawlessly with Israel, so that Jerusalem shall not endure your wickedness; but
the veil of the temple shall be rent, so as not to cover your shame. And ye shall be scattered
as captives among the heathen, and shall be for a reproach and for a curse, and for a
trampling under foot. For the house which the Lord shall choose shall be called Jerusalem,
as is contained in the book of Enoch the righteous.81</p>
<p>11. Therefore, when I took a wife I was twenty-eight years old, and her name was
Melcha. And she conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Gersham, for we were
sojourners in our land: for Gersham is interpreted sojourning. And I saw concerning him
that he would not be in the first rank. And Kohath was born in my thirty-fifth year, towards
the east. And I saw in a vision that he was standing on high in the midst of all the congregation.
Therefore I called his name Kohath, which meaneth, beginning of majesty and instruction.
And thirdly, she bare to me Merari, in the fortieth year of my life; and since his
mother bare him with difficulty, she called him Merari, which meaneth my bitterness, because
he also died. And Jochebed was born in my sixty-fourth year, in Egypt, for I was renowned
then in the midst of my brethren.</p>

<p>12. And Gersham took a wife, and she bare to him Lomni and Semei. And the sons of
Kohath, Ambram, Isaar, Chebro, and Ozel. And the sons of Merari, Mooli and Homusi.
And in my ninety-fourth year Ambram took Jochebed my daughter to him to wife, for they
were born in one day, he and my daughter. Eight years old was I when I went into the land
of Canaan, and eighteen years when I slew Shechem, and at nineteen years I became priest,
and at twenty-eight years I took a wife, and at forty years I went into Egypt. And behold,
ye are my children, my children even of a third generation. In my hundred and eighteenth
year Joseph died.</p>
<p>13. And now, my children, I command you that ye fear our Lord with your whole heart,
and walk in simplicity according to all His82 law. And do ye also teach your children
learning, that they may have understanding in all their life, reading unceasingly the law of
God; for every one who shall know the law of God shall be honoured, and shall not be a
stranger wheresoever he goeth. Yea, many friends shall he gain more than his forefathers;
and many men shall desire to serve him, and to hear the law from his mouth. Work righteousness,
my children, upon the earth, that ye may find treasure in the heavens, and sow
good things in your souls, that ye may find them in your life. For if ye sow evil things, ye
shall reap all trouble and affliction. Get wisdom in the fear of God with diligence; for though
there shall be a leading into captivity, and cities be destroyed, and lands and gold and silver
and every possession shall perish, the wisdom of the wise none can take away, save the
blindness of ungodliness and the palsy of sin: for even among his enemies shall it be to him
glorious, and in a strange country a home, and in the midst of foes shall it be found a friend.
If a man teach these things and do them, he shall be enthroned with kings, as was also Joseph
our brother.</p>
<p>14. And now, my children, I have learnt from the writing of Enoch that at the last ye
will deal ungodly, laying your hands upon the Lord in all malice; and your brethren shall
be ashamed because of you, and to all the Gentiles shall it become a mocking. For our
father Israel shall be pure from the ungodliness of the chief priests who shall lay their hands
upon the Saviour of the world. Pure is the heaven above the earth, and ye are the lights of
the heaven as the sun and the moon. What shall all the Gentiles do if ye be darkened in
ungodliness? So shall ye bring a curse upon our race for whom came the light of the world,
which was given among you for the lighting up of every man.83 Him will ye desire to slay,
teaching commandments contrary to the ordinances of God. The offerings of the Lord will
ye rob, and from His portion will ye steal; and before ye sacrifice to the Lord, ye will take

the choicest parts, in despitefulness eating them with harlots. Amid excesses84 will ye teach
the commandments of the Lord, the women that have husbands will ye pollute, and the
virgins of Jerusalem will ye defile; and with harlots and adulteresses will ye be joined. The
daughters of the Gentiles will ye take for wives, purifying them with an unlawful purification;
and your union shall be like unto Sodom and Gomorrah in ungodliness. And ye will be
puffed up because of the priesthood lifting yourselves up against men. And not only so, but
being puffed up also against the commands of God, ye will scoff at the holy things, mocking
in despitefulness.</p>
<p>15. Therefore the temple which the Lord shall choose shall be desolate in uncleanness,
and ye shall be captives throughout all nations, and ye shall be an abomination among them,
and ye shall receive reproach and everlasting shame from the righteous judgment of God;
and all who see you shall flee from you. And were it not for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob our
fathers, not one from my seed should be left upon the earth.</p>
<p>16. And now I have learnt in the book of Enoch that for seventy weeks will ye go astray,
and will profane the priesthood, and pollute the sacrifices, and corrupt the law, and set at
nought the words of the prophets. In perverseness ye will persecute righteous men, and
hate the godly; the words of the faithful will ye abhor, and the man who reneweth the law
in the power of the Most High will ye call a deceiver;85 and at last, as ye suppose, ye will slay
Him, not understanding His resurrection, wickedly taking upon your own heads the innocent
blood.86 Because of Him shall your holy places be desolate, polluted even to the ground,
and ye shall have no place that is clean; but ye shall be among the Gentiles a curse and a
dispersion, until He shall again look upon you, and in pity shall take you to Himself through
faith and water.87</p>
<p>17. And because ye have heard concerning the seventy weeks, hear also concerning the
priesthood; for in each jubilee there shall be a priesthood. In the first jubilee, the first who
is anointed into the priesthood shall be great, and shall speak to God as to a Father; and his
priesthood shall be filled with the fear of the Lord, and in the day of his gladness shall he
arise for the salvation of the world. In the second jubilee, he that is anointed shall be conceived
in the sorrow of beloved ones; and his priesthood shall be honoured, and shall be
glorified among all. And the third priest shall be held fast in sorrow; and the fourth shall
be in grief, because unrighteousness shall be laid upon him exceedingly, and all Israel shall

be in captivity and for a prey, and their land and their substance shall be destroyed. And

up to the priesthood a new Priest, to whom all the words of the Lord shall be revealed; and
He shall execute a judgment of truth upon the earth,88 in the fulness of days. And His star
shall arise in heaven,89 as a king shedding forth the light of knowledge in the sunshine of
day, and He shall be magnified in the world until His ascension. He shall shine forth as the
sun in the earth, and shall drive away all darkness from the world under heaven, and there
shall be peace in all the earth. The heavens shall rejoice in His days, and the earth shall be
glad, and the clouds shall be joyful, and the knowledge of the Lord shall be poured forth
upon the earth, as the water of seas; and the angels of the glory of the presence of the Lord

to His sons in truth for evermore; and there shall none succeed Him for all generations,
even for ever.90 And in His priesthood shall all sin come to an end, and the lawless shall
rest from evil, and the just shall rest in Him. And He shall open the gates of paradise, and
shall remove91 the threatening sword against Adam; and He shall give to His saints to eat
from the tree of life,92 and the spirit of holiness shall be on them. And Beliar shall be bound

<head>IV.—The Testament of Judah Concerning Fortitude, and Love of
Money, and Fornication.</head>
<p>1. The copy of the words of Judah, what things he spake to his sons before he died.
They gathered themselves together, and came to him, and he said to them: I was the fourth
son born to my father, and my mother called me Judah, saying, I give thanks to the Lord,
because He hath given to me even a fourth son.94 I was swift and active in my youth, and
obedient to my father in everything. And I honoured my mother and my mother’s sister.
And it came to pass, when I became a man, that my father Jacob prayed over me, saying,
Thou shalt be a king, and prosperous in all things.</p>
<p>2. And the Lord showed me favour in all my works both in the field and at home. When
I saw that I could run with the hind, then I caught it, and prepared meat for my father. I
seized upon the roes in the chase, and all that was in the plains I outran. A wild mare I
outran, and I caught it and tamed it; and I slew a lion, and plucked a kid out of its mouth.
I took a bear by its paw, and rolled it over a cliff; and if any beast turned upon me, I rent it
like a dog. I encountered the wild boar, and overtaking it in the chase, I tore it. A leopard
in Hebron leaped upon the dog, and I caught it by the tail, and flung it from me, and it was
dashed to pieces in the coasts of Gaza. A wild ox feeding in the field I seized by the horns;
and whirling it round and stunning it, I cast it from me, and slew it.</p>
<p>3. And when the two kings of the Canaanites came in warlike array against our flocks,
and much people with them, I by myself rushed upon King Sur and seized him; and I beat
him upon the legs, and dragged him down, and so I slew him. And the other king, Taphue,95
I slew as he sat upon his horse, and so I scattered all the people. Achor the king, a man of
giant stature, hurling darts before and behind as he sat on horseback, I slew; for I hurled a
stone of sixty pounds weight, and cast it upon his horse, and killed him. And I fought with
Achor for two hours, and I killed him; and I clave his shield into two parts, and I chopped
off his feet. And as I stripped off his breastplate, behold, eight men his companions began
to fight with me. I wound round therefore my garment in my hand; and I slang stones at
them, and killed four of them, and the rest fled. And Jacob my father slew Beelisa, king of
all the kings, a giant in strength, twelve cubits high; and fear fell upon them, and they ceased
from making war with us. Therefore my father had no care in the wars when I was among
my brethren. For he saw in a vision concerning me, that an angel of might followed me
everywhere, that I should not be overcome.</p>

battle array with my brethren, and pursued a thousand men, and slew of them two hundred
men and four kings. And I went up against them upon the wall, and two other kings I slew;
and so we freed Hebron, and took all the captives of the kings.</p>
<p>5. On the next day we departed to Areta,96 a city strong and walled and inaccessible,
threatening us with death. Therefore I and Gad approached on the east side of the city, and
Reuben and Levi on the west and south. And they that were upon the wall, thinking that
we were alone, charged down upon us; and so our brethren secretly climbed up the wall on
both sides by ladders, and entered into the city, while the men knew it not. And we took it
with the edge of the sword; and those who had taken refuge in the tower,—we set fire to the
tower, and took both it and them. And as we were departing the men of Thaffu set upon
our captives, and we took it with our sons, and fought with them even to Thaffu; and we
slew them, and burnt their city, and spoiled all the things that were therein.</p>
<p>6. And when I was at the waters of Chuzeba,97 the men of Jobel came against us to
battle, and we fought with them; and their allies from Selom98 we slew, and we allowed them
no means of escaping, and of coming against us. And the men of Machir99 came upon us
on the fifth day, to carry away our captives; and we attacked them, and overcame them in
fierce battle: for they were a host and mighty in themselves, and we slew them before they
had gone up the ascent of the hill. And when we came to their city, their women rolled
upon us stones from the brow of the hill on which the city stood. And I and Simeon hid
ourselves behind the town, and seized upon the heights, and utterly destroyed the whole
city.</p>
<p>7. And the next day it was told us that the cities100 of the two kings with a great host
were coming against us. I therefore and Dan feigned ourselves to be Amorites, and went
as allies into their city. And in the depth of night our brethren came, and we opened to

where was all the refuge of the hostile kings. Then having received hurt I was wroth, and
charged upon them to the brow of the hill; and they slang at me with stones and darts; and
had not Dan my brother aided me, they would have been able to slay me. We came upon
them therefore with wrath, and they all fled; and passing by another way, they besought my
father, and he made peace with them, and we did to them no hurt, but made a truce with
them, and restored to them all the captives. And I built Thamna, and my father built
Rhambael.102 I was twenty years old when this war befell, and the Canaanites feared me
and my brethren.</p>
<p>8. Moreover, I had much cattle, and I had for the chief of my herdsmen Iran103 the
Adullamite. And when I went to him I saw Barsan, king of Adullam, and he made us a feast;
and he entreated me, and gave me his daughter Bathshua to wife. She bare me Er, and Onan,
and Shelah; and the two of them the Lord smote that they died childless: for Shelah lived,
and his children are ye.</p>
<p>9. Eighteen years we abode at peace, our father and we, with his brother Esau, and his
sons with us, after that we came from Mesopotamia, from Laban. And when eighteen years
were fulfilled, in the fortieth year of my life, Esau, the brother of my father, came upon us
with much people and strong; and he fell by the bow of Jacob, and was taken up dead in
Mount Seir: even as he went above Iramna104 was he slain. And we pursued after the sons
of Esau. Now they had a city with walls of iron and gates of brass; and we could not enter
into it, and we encamped around, and besieged them. And when they opened not to us
after twenty days, I set up a ladder in the sight of all, and with my shield upon my head I
climbed up, assailed with stones of three talents’ weight; and I climbed up, and slew four
who were mighty among them. And the next day Reuben and Gad entered in and slew sixty
others. Then they asked from us terms of peace; and being aware of our father’s purpose,
we received them as tributaries. And they gave us two hundred cors of wheat, five hundred
baths of oil, fifteen hundred measures of wine, until we went down into Egypt.</p>
<p>10. After these things, my son Er took to wife Tamar, from Mesopotamia, a daughter
of Aram.105 Now Er was wicked, and he doubted concerning Tamar, because she was not
of the land of Canaan. And on the third day an angel of the Lord smote him in the night,

and he had not known her, according to the evil craftiness of his mother, for he did not wish
to have children from her. In the days of the wedding-feast I espoused Onan to her; and he
also in wickedness knew her not, though he lived with her a year. And when I threatened
him, he lay with her,106 …according to the command of his mother, and he also died in his
wickedness. And I wished to give Shelah also to her, but my wife Bathshua suffered it not;
for she bore a spite against Tamar, because she was not of the daughters of Canaan, as she
herself was.</p>
<p>11. And I knew that the race of Canaan was wicked, but the thoughts of youth blinded
my heart. And when I saw her pouring out wine, in the drunkenness of wine was I deceived,
and I fell before her. And while I was away, she went and took for Shelah a wife from the
land of Caanan. And when I knew what she had done, I cursed her in the anguish of my
soul, and she also died in the wickedness of her sons.</p>
<p>12. And after these things, while Tamar was a widow, she heard after two years that I
was going up to shear my sheep; then she decked herself in bridal array, and sat over against
the city by the gate. For it is a law of the Amorites, that she who is about to marry sit in
fornication seven days by the gate.107 I therefore, being drunk at the waters of Chozeb, recognised
her not by reason of wine; and her beauty deceived me, through the fashion of her
adorning. And I turned aside to her, and said, I would enter in to thee. And she said to me,
What wilt thou give me? And I gave her my staff, and my girdle, and my royal crown; and
I lay with her, and she conceived. I then, not knowing what she had done, wished to slay
her; but she privily sent my pledges, and put me to shame. And when I called her, I heard
also the secret words which I spoke when lying with her in my drunkenness; and I could
not slay her, because it was from the Lord. For I said, Lest haply she did it in subtlety, and
received the pledge from another woman: but I came near her no more till my death, because
I had done this abomination in all Israel. Moreover, they who were in the city said that
there was no bride in the city, because she came from another place, and sat for awhile in
the gate, and she thought that no one knew that I had gone in to her.108 And after this we
came into Egypt to Joseph, because of the famine. Forty and six years old was I, and seventy
and three years lived I there.</p>
<p>13. And now, my children, in what things so ever I command you hearken to your
father, and keep all my sayings to perform the ordinances of the Lord, and to obey the
command of the Lord God. And walk not after your lusts, nor in the thoughts of your
imaginations in the haughtiness of your heart; and glory not in the works of the strength of
youth, for this also is evil in the eyes of the Lord. For since I also gloried that in wars the

face of no woman of goodly form ever deceived me, and upbraided Reuben my brother
concerning Bilhah, the wife of my father, the spirits of jealousy and of fornication arrayed
themselves within me, until I fell before Bathshua the Canaanite, and Tamar who was espoused
to my sons. And I said to my father-in-law, I will counsel with my father, and so
will I take thy daughter. And he showed me a boundless store of gold in his daughter’s behalf,
for he was a king. And he decked her with gold and pearls, and caused her to pour out wine
for us at the feast in womanly beauty. And the wine led my eyes astray, and pleasure blinded
my heart; and I loved her, and I fell, and transgressed the commandment of the Lord and
the commandment of my fathers, and I took her to wife. And the Lord rewarded me according
to the thought of my heart, insomuch that I had no joy in her children.</p>
<p>14. And now, my children, be not drunk with wine; for wine turneth the mind away
from the truth, and kindleth in it the passion of lust, and leadeth the eyes into error. For
the spirit of fornication hath wine as a minister to give pleasures to the mind; for these two
take away the power from a man. For if a man drink wine to drunkenness, he disturbeth
his mind with filthy thoughts to fornication, and exciteth his body to carnal union; and if
the cause of the desire be present, he worketh the sin, and is not ashamed. Such is wine, my
children; for he who is drunken reverenceth no man. For, lo, it made me also to err, so that
I was not ashamed of the multitude in the city, because before the eyes of all I turned aside
unto Tamar, and I worked a great sin, and I uncovered the covering of the shame of my
sons. After that I drank wine I reverenced not the commandment of God, and I took a
woman of Canaan to wife. Wherefore, my children, he who drinketh wine needeth discretion;
and herein is discretion in drinking wine, that a man should drink as long as he keepeth
decency; but if he go beyond this bound, the spirit of deceit attacketh his mind and worketh
his will; and it maketh the drunkard to talk filthily, and to transgress and not to be ashamed,
but even to exult in his dishonour, accounting himself to do well.</p>
<p>15. He that committeth fornication, and109 uncovereth his nakedness, hath become
the servant of fornication, and escapeth not110 from the power thereof, even as I also was
uncovered. For I gave my staff, that is, the stay of my tribe; and my girdle, that is, my power;
and my diadem, that is, the glory of my kingdom. Then I repented for these things, and
took no wine or flesh until my old age, nor did I behold any joy. And the angel of God
showed me that for ever do women bear rule over king and beggar alike; and from the king
they take away his glory, and from the valiant man his strength, and from the beggar even
that little which is the stay of his poverty.</p>

<p>16. Observe therefore, my children, moderation in wine; for there are in it four evil
spirits—of (1) lust, of (2) wrath, of (3) riot, of (4) filthy lucre. If ye drink wine in gladness,
with shamefacedness, with the fear of God, ye shall live. For if ye drink not with shamefacedness,
and the fear of God departeth from you, then cometh drunkenness, and shamelessness
stealeth in. But111 even if ye drink not at all, take heed lest ye sin in words of outrage, and
fighting, and slander, and transgression of the commandments of God; so shall ye perish
before your time. Moreover, wine revealeth the mysteries of God and men to aliens, even
as I also revealed the commandments of God and the mysteries of Jacob my father to the
Canaanitish Bathshua, to whom God forbade to declare them. And wine also is a cause of
war and confusion.</p>
<p>17. I charge you, therefore, my children, not to love money, nor to gaze upon the beauty
of women; because for the sake of money and beauty I was led astray to Bathshua the
Canaanite. For I know that because of these two things shall ye who are my race fall into
wickedness; for even wise men among my sons shall they mar, and shall cause the kingdom
of Judah to be diminished, which the Lord gave me because of my obedience to my father.112
For I never disobeyed a word of Jacob my father, for all things whatsoever he commanded
I did. And Abraham, the father of my father, blessed me that I should be king in Israel, and
Isaac further blessed me in like manner. And I know that from me shall the kingdom be
established.</p>
<p>18. For I have read also in the books of Enoch the righteous what evils ye shall do in
the last days. Take heed, therefore, my children, of fornication and the love of money;
hearken to Judah your father, for these things do withdraw you from the law of God, and
blind the understanding of the soul, and teach arrogance, and suffer not a man to have
compassion upon his neighbour: they rob his soul of all goodness, and bind him in toils
and troubles, and take away his sleep and devour his flesh, and hinder the sacrifices of God;
and he remembereth not blessing, and he hearkeneth not to a prophet when he speaketh,
and is vexed at the word of godliness. For one who serveth two passions contrary to the
commandments of God cannot obey God, because they have blinded his soul, and he walketh
in the day-time as in the night.</p>
<p>19. My children, the love of money leadeth to idols; because, when led astray through
money, men make mention of those who are no gods, and it causeth him who hath it to fall
into madness. For the sake of money I lost my children, and but for the repentance of my
flesh, and the humbling of my soul, and the prayers of Jacob my father, I should have died
childless. But the God of my fathers, who is pitiful and merciful, pardoned me, because I
did it in ignorance.113 For the prince of deceit blinded me, and I was ignorant as a man and

as flesh, being corrupted in sins; and I learnt my own weakness while thinking myself unconquerable.</p>
<p>20. 115Learn therefore, my children, that two spirits wait upon man—the spirit of truth
and the spirit of error; and in the midst is the spirit of the understanding of the mind, to
which it belongeth to turn whithersoever it will. And the works of truth and the works of
error are written upon the breast of men, and each one of them the Lord knoweth. And
there is no time at which the works of men can be hid from Him; for on the bones of his
breast hath he been written down before the Lord. And the spirit of truth testifieth all things,
and accuseth all; and he who sinneth is burnt up by his own heart, and cannot raise his face
unto the Judge.</p>
<p>21. And now, my children, love Levi, that ye may abide, and exalt not yourselves against
him, lest ye be utterly destroyed. For to me the Lord gave the kingdom, and to him the
priesthood, and He set the kingdom beneath the priesthood. To me He gave the things
upon the earth; to him the things in the heavens. As the heaven is higher than the earth, so
is the priesthood of God higher than the kingdom upon the earth. For the Lord chose him
above thee, to draw near to Him, and to eat of His table and first-fruits, even the choice
things of the sons of Israel, and thou shalt be to them as a sea. For as, on the sea, just and
unjust are tossed about, some taken into captivity while others are enriched, so also shall
every race of men be in thee, some are in jeopardy and taken captive, and others shall grow
rich by means of plunder. For they who rule will be as great sea-monsters, swallowing up
men like fishes: free sons and daughters do they enslave; houses, lands, flocks, money, will
they plunder; and with the flesh of many will they wrongfully feed the ravens and the cranes;
and they will go on further in evil, advancing on still in covetousness. And there shall be
false prophets like tempests, and they shall persecute all righteous men.</p>
<p>22. And the Lord shall bring upon them divisions one against another, and there shall
be continual wars in Israel; and among men of other race shall my kingdom be brought to
an end, until the salvation of Israel shall come, until the appearing of the God of righteous-
ness, that Jacob and all the Gentiles may rest in peace.116 And he shall guard the might of
my kingdom for ever: for the Lord sware to me with an oath that the kingdom should
never fail from me, and from my seed for all days, even for ever.</p>
<p>23. Now I have much grief, my children, because of your lewdness, and witchcrafts,
and idolatries, which ye will work against the kingdom, following them that have familiar

demons of error, and ye will be mingled in the pollutions of the Gentiles: for which things’
sake the Lord shall bring upon you famine and pestilence, death and the sword, avenging
siege, and dogs for the rending in pieces of enemies, and revilings of friends, destruction
and blighting of eyes, children slaughtered, wives carried off, possessions plundered, temple
of God in flames, your land desolated, your own selves enslaved among the Gentiles, and
they shall make some of you eunuchs for their wives; and whenever ye will return to the
Lord with humility of heart, repenting and walking in all the commandments of God, then
will the Lord visit you in mercy and in love, bringing you from out of the bondage of your
enemies.</p>
<p>24. And after these things shall a Star arise to you from Jacob in peace, and a Man shall
rise from my seed, like the Sun of righteousness, walking with the sons of men119 in meekness
and righteousness, and no sin shall be found in Him. And the heavens shall be opened
above Him, to shed forth the blessing of the Spirit from the Holy Father; and He shall shed
forth a spirit of grace upon you, and ye shall be unto Him sons in truth, and ye shall walk
in His commandments, the first and the last. This is the Branch of God Most High, and
this the Well-spring unto life for all flesh. 120Then shall the sceptre of my kingdom shine
forth, and from your root shall arise a stem; and in it shall arise a rod of righteousness to
the Gentiles, to judge and to save all that call upon the Lord.</p>
<p>25. And after these things shall Abraham and Isaac and Jacob arise unto life, and I and
my brethren will be chiefs, even your sceptre in Israel: Levi first, I the second, Joseph third,
Benjamin fourth, Simeon fifth, Issachar sixth, and so all in order. And the Lord blessed

lights of heaven, Dan; the fatness of earth, Naphtali; the sun, Gad; the olive, Asher: and

of deceit of Beliar, for he shall be cast into the fire for ever. And they who have died in grief
shall arise in joy, and they who have lived in poverty for the Lord’s sake shall be made rich,
and they who have been in want shall be filled, and they who have been weak shall be made
strong, and they who have been put to death for the Lord’s sake shall awake in life.122 And

<head>V.—The Testament of Issachar Concerning Simplicity.</head>
<p>1. The record of the words of Issachar. He called his sons, and said to them: Hearken,
my children, to Issachar your father; give ear to my words, ye who are beloved of the Lord.
I was the fifth son born to Jacob, even the hire of the mandrakes.124 For Reuben125 brought
in mandrakes from the field, and Rachel met him and took them. And Reuben wept, and
at his voice Leah my mother came forth. Now these mandrakes were sweet-smelling apples
which the land of Aram produced on high ground below a ravine of water. And Rachel
said, I will not give them to thee, for they shall be to me instead of children. Now there were
two apples; and Leah said, Let it suffice thee that thou hast taken the husband of my virginity:
wilt thou also take these? And she said, Behold, let Jacob be to thee this night instead of the
mandrakes of thy son. And Leah said to her, Boast not, and vaunt not thyself; for Jacob is
mine, and I am the wife of his youth. But Rachel said, How so? for to me was he first espoused,
and for my sake he served our father fourteen years. What shall I do to thee, because
the craft and the subtlety of men are increased, and craft prospereth upon the earth? And
were it not so, thou wouldest not now see the face of Jacob. For thou art not his wife, but
in craft wert taken to him in my stead. And my father deceived me, and removed me on
that night, and suffered me not to see him; for had I been there, it had not happened thus.
And Rachel said, Take one mandrake, and for the other thou shalt hire him from me for
one night. And Jacob knew Leah, and she conceived and bare me, and on account of the
hire126 I was called Issachar.</p>
<p>2. Then appeared to Jacob an angel of the Lord, saying, Two children shall Rachel bear;
for she hath refused company with her husband, and hath chosen continency. And had not
Leah my mother given up the two apples for the sake of his company, she would have borne
eight sons; and for this thing she bare six, and Rachel two: because on account of the mandrakes
the Lord visited her. For He knew that for the sake of children she wished to company
with Jacob, and not for lust of pleasure.127 For she went further, and on the morrow too
gave up Jacob that she might receive also the other mandrake. Therefore the Lord hearkened
to Rachel because of the mandrakes: for though she desired them, she ate them not, but
brought them to the priest of the Most High who was at that time, and offered them up in
the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>3. When, therefore, I grew up, my children, I walked in uprightness of heart, and I became
a husbandman for my parents and my brethren, and I brought in fruits from the field

according to their season; and my father blessed me, for he saw that I walked in simplicity.
And I was not a busybody in my doings, nor malicious and slanderous against my neighbour.
I never spoke against any one, nor did I censure the life of any man, but walked in the simplicity
of my eyes. Therefore when I was thirty years old I took to myself a wife, for my labour
wore away my strength, and I never thought upon pleasure with women; but through my
labour my sleep sufficed me, and my father always rejoiced in my simplicity. For on whatever
I laboured I offered first to the Lord, by the hands of the priests, of all my produce and all
first-fruits; then to my father, and then took for myself. And the Lord increased twofold
His benefits in my hands; and Jacob also knew that God aided my simplicity, for on every
poor man and every one in distress I bestowed the good things of the earth in simplicity of
heart.</p>
<p>4. And now hearken to me, my children, and walk in simplicity of heart, for I have seen
in it all that is well-pleasing to the Lord. The simple coveteth not gold, defraudeth not his
neighbour, longeth not after manifold dainties, delighteth not in varied apparel, doth not
picture to himself to live a long life, but only waiteth for the will of God, and the spirits of
error have no power against him. For he cannot allow within his mind a thought of female
beauty, that he should not pollute his mind in corruption. No envy can enter into his
thoughts, no jealousy melteth away his soul, nor doth he brood over gain with insatiate desire;
for he walketh in uprightness of life, and beholdeth all things in simplicity, not admitting
in his eyes malice from the error of the world, lest he should see the perversion of any of
the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p>5. Keep therefore the law of God, my children, and get simplicity, and walk in guilelessness,
not prying over-curiously into the commands of God and the business of your neighbour;
but love the Lord and your neighbour, have compassion on the poor and weak. Bow
down your back unto husbandry, and labour in tillage of the ground in all manner of husbandry,
offering gifts unto the Lord with thanksgiving; for with the first-fruits of the earth
did the Lord bless me, even as He blessed all the saints from Abel even until now. For no
other portion is given to thee than of the fatness of the earth, whose fruits are raised by toil;
for our father Jacob blessed me with blessings of the earth and of first-fruits. And Levi and
Judah were glorified by the Lord among the sons of Jacob; for the Lord made choice of them,
and to the one He gave the priesthood, to the other the kingdom. Them therefore obey,
and walk in the simplicity of your father; for unto Gad hath it been given to destroy the
temptations that are coming upon Israel.</p>
<p>6. I know, my children, that in the last times your sons will forsake simplicity, and will
cleave unto avarice, and leaving guilelessness will draw near to malice, and forsaking the
commandments of the Lord will cleave unto Beliar, and leaving husbandry will follow after
their wicked devices, and shall be dispersed among the Gentiles, and shall serve their enemies.
And do you therefore command these things to your children, that if they sin they may the

more quickly return to the Lord; for He is merciful, and will deliver them even to bring
them back into their land.</p>
<p>7. I am a hundred and twenty-two years old, and I know not against myself a sin unto
death. Except my wife, I have not known any woman. I never committed fornication in
the haughtiness of my eyes; I drank not wine, to be led astray thereby; I coveted not any
desirable thing that was my neighbour’s; guile never entered in my heart; a lie never passed
through my lips; if any man grieved, I wept with him, and I shared my bread with the poor.
I never ate alone; I moved no landmark; in all my days I wrought godliness and truth. I
loved the Lord with all my strength; likewise also did I love every man even as my own
children. So ye also do these things, my children, and every spirit of Beliar shall flee from
you, and no deed of malicious men shall rule over you; and every wild beast shall ye subdue,
having with yourselves the God of heaven walking with men in simplicity of heart.</p>
<p>And he commanded them that they should carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there
in the cave with his fathers. And he stretched out his feet and died, the fifth son of Jacob,

<head>VI.—The Testament of Zebulun Concerning Compassion and Mercy.</head>
<p>1. The record of Zebulun, which he enjoined his children in the hundred129 and fourteenth
year of his life, thirty-two years after the death of Joseph. And he said to them:
Hearken to me sons of Zebulun, attend to the words of your father. I am Zebulun, a good
gift130 to my parents. For when I was born our father was increased very exceedingly, both
in flocks and herds, when with the streaked rods he had his portion. I know not, my children,
that in all my days I have sinned, save only in thought. Nor do I remember that I have done
any iniquity, except the sin of ignorance which I committed against Joseph; for I screened
my brethren, not telling to my father what had been done. And I wept sore in secret, for I
feared my brethren, because they had all agreed together, that if any one should declare the
secret, he should be slain with the sword. But when they wished to kill him, I adjured them
much with tears not to be guilty of this iniquity.</p>
<p>2. For Simeon and Gad came against Joseph to kill him. And Joseph fell upon his face,
and said unto them, Pity me, my brethren, have compassion upon the bowels of Jacob our
father: lay not upon me your hands to shed innocent blood, for I have not sinned against
you; yea, if I have sinned, with chastening chastise me, but lay not upon me your hand, for
the sake of Jacob our father. And as he spoke these words, I pitied him and began to weep,
and my heart melted within me, and all the substance of my bowels was loosened within
my soul. And Joseph also wept, and I too wept with him; and my heart throbbed fast, and
the joints of my body trembled, and I was not able to stand. And when he saw me weeping
with him, and them coming against him to slay him, he fled behind me, beseeching them.
And Reuben rose and said, My brethren, let us not slay him, but let us cast him into one of
these dry pits which our fathers digged and found no water. For for this cause the Lord
forbade that water should rise up in them, in order that Joseph might be preserved; and the
Lord appointed it so, until they sold him to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>3. For in the price of Joseph, my children, I had no share; but Simeon and Gad and six
other of our brethren took the price of Joseph, and bought sandals131 for themselves, their
wives, and their children, saying, We will not eat of it, for it is the price of our brother’s

the age of 110. According to the Ox. ms., Reuben (cf. c. 1) and Zebulun would die in the same year, the former
at 125, the latter 150. A comparison of Test. Reub., c. 1 shows the most probable solution to be to give the numerals,

blood, but will tread it down under foot, because he said that he was king over us, and so
let us see what his dreams mean. Therefore is it written in the writing of the law of Enoch,
that whosoever will not raise up seed to his brother, his sandal shall be unloosed, and they
shall spit into his face.132 And the brethren of Joseph wished not that their brother should
live, and the Lord loosed unto them the sandal of Joseph. For when they came into Egypt
they were unloosed by the servants of Joseph before the gate, and so made obeisance to
Joseph after the fashion of Pharaoh. And not only did they make obeisance to him, but
were spit upon also, falling down before him forthwith, and so they were put to shame before
the Egyptians; for after this the Egyptians heard all the evils which we had done to Joseph.</p>
<p>4. After these things they brought forth food; for I through two days and two nights
tasted nothing, through pity for Joseph. And Judah ate not with them, but watched the pit;
for he feared lest Simeon and Gad should run back and slay him. And when they saw that
I also ate not, they set me to watch him until he was sold. And he remained in the pit three
days and three nights, and so was sold famishing. And when Reuben heard that while he
was away Joseph had been sold, he rent his clothes about him, and mourned, saying, How
shall I look in the face of Jacob my father? And he took the money, and ran after the merchants,
and found no one; for they had left the main road, and journeyed hastily through
rugged byways.133 And Reuben ate no food on that day. Dan therefore came to him, and
said, Weep not, neither grieve; for I have found what we can say to our father Jacob. Let us
slay a kid of the goats, and dip in it the coat of Joseph; and we will say, Look, if this is the
coat of thy son: for they stripped off from Joseph the coat of our father when they were
about to sell him, and put upon him an old garment of a slave. Now Simeon had the coat,
and would not give it up, wishing to rend it with his sword; for he was angry that Joseph
lived, and that he had not slain him. Then we all rose up together against him, and said, If
thou give it not up, we will say that thou alone didst this wickedness in Israel; and so he gave
it up, and they did even as Dan had said.</p>
<p>5. And now, my children, I bid you to keep the commands of the Lord, and to show
mercy upon your neighbour, and to have compassion towards all, not towards men only,
but also towards beasts. For for this thing’s sake the Lord blessed me; and when all my
brethren were sick I escaped without sickness, for the Lord knoweth the purposes of each.
Have therefore compassion in your hearts, my children, because even as a man doeth to his
neighbour, even so also will the Lord do to him. For the sons of my brethren were sickening,
were dying on account of Joseph, because they showed not mercy in their hearts; but my
sons were preserved without sickness, as ye know. And when I was in Canaan, by the sea-

coast, I caught spoil of fish for Jacob my father; and when many were choked in the sea, I
abode unhurt.</p>
<p>6. I was the first who made a boat to sail upon the sea, for the Lord gave me understanding
and wisdom therein; and I let down a rudder behind it, and I stretched a sail on an upright
mast in the midst; and sailing therein along the shores, I caught fish for the house of my
father until we went into Egypt; and through compassion, I gave of my fish to every stranger.
And if any man were a stranger, or sick, or aged, I boiled the fish and dressed them well,
and offered them to all men as every man had need, bringing them together and having
compassion upon them. Wherefore also the Lord granted me to take much fish: for he that
imparteth unto his neighbour, receiveth manifold more from the Lord. For five years I
caught fish, and gave thereof to every man whom I saw, and brought sufficient for all the
house of my father. In the summer I caught fish, and in the winter I kept sheep with my
brethren.</p>
<p>7. Now I will declare unto you what I did, I saw a man in distress and nakedness in
wintertime, and had compassion upon him, and stole away134 a garment secretly from my
house, and gave it to him who was in distress. Do you therefore, my children, from that
which God bestoweth upon you, show compassion and mercy impartially to all men, and
give to every man with a good heart. And if ye have not at the time wherewith to give to
him that asketh you, have compassion for him in bowels of mercy. I know that my hand
found not at the time wherewith to give to him that asked me, and I walked with him
weeping for more than seven furlongs, and my bowels yearned towards him unto compassion.</p>
<p>8. Have therefore yourselves also, my children, compassion towards every man with
mercy, that the Lord also may have compassion upon you, and have mercy upon you; because
also in the last days God sendeth His compassion on the earth, and wheresoever He findeth
bowels of mercy, He dwelleth in him. For how much compassion a man hath upon his
neighbours, so much also hath the Lord upon him. For when we went down into Egypt,
Joseph bore no malice against us, and when he saw me he was filled with compassion. And
looking towards him, do ye also, my children, approve yourselves without malice, and love
one another; and reckon not each one the evil of his brother, for this breaketh unity, and
divideth all kindred, and troubleth the soul: for he who beareth malice hath not bowels of
mercy.</p>
<p>9. Mark the waters, that they flow together, and sweep along stones, trees, sand; but if
they are divided into many streams, the earth sucketh them up, and they become of no account.
So also shall ye be if ye be divided. Divide not yourselves into two heads, for
everything which the Lord made hath but one head; He gave two shoulders, hands, feet, but
all the members are subject unto the one head. I have learnt by the writing of my fathers,
<note type="footnote">134 [“Finis non determinat probitatem actus.”]</note>

<pb n="46"/>
that in the last days ye will depart from the Lord, and be divided in Israel, and ye will follow
two kings, and will work every abomination, and every idol will ye worship, and your enemies
shall lead you captive, and ye shall dwell among the nations with all infirmities and tribulations
and anguish of soul. And after these things ye will remember the Lord, and will repent,
and He will lead you back; for He is merciful and full of compassion, not imputing evil to
the sons of men, because they are flesh, and the spirits of error deceive them in all their doings.
And after these things shall the Lord Himself arise to you,135 the Light of righteousness,
and healing136 and compassion shall be upon His wings. He shall redeem all captivity of
the sons of men from Beliar, and every spirit of error shall be trodden down. And He shall
bring back all the nations to zeal for Him, and ye shall see God in the fashion of a man137
whom the Lord shall choose, Jerusalem is His name. And again with the wickedness of your
words will ye provoke Him to anger, and ye shall be cast away, even unto the time of consummation.</p>
<p>10. And now, my children, grieve not that I am dying, nor be troubled in that I am
passing away from you. For I shall arise once more in the midst of you, as a ruler in the
midst of his sons; and I will rejoice in the midst of my tribe, as many as have kept the law
of the Lord, and the commandments of Zebulun their father.138 But upon the ungodly shall
the Lord bring everlasting fire, and will destroy them throughout all generations. I am
hastening away unto my rest, as did my fathers; but do ye fear the Lord your God with all
your strength all the days of your life. And when he had said these things he fell calmly
asleep, and his sons laid him in a coffin; and afterwards they carried him up to Hebron, and
buried him with his fathers.</p>

<head>VII.—The Testament of Dan Concerning Anger and Lying.</head>
<p>1. The record of the words of Dan, which he spake to his sons in his last days. In the
hundred and twenty-fifth year of his life he called together his family, and said: Hearken
to my words, ye sons of Dan; give heed to the words of the mouth of your father. I have
proved in my heart, and in my whole life, that truth with just dealing is good and wellpleasing
to God, and that lying and anger are evil, because they teach man all wickedness.
I confess this day to you, my children, that in my heart I rejoiced concerning the death of
Joseph, a true and good man; and I rejoiced at the selling of Joseph, because his father loved
him more than us. For the spirit of jealousy and of vainglory said to me, Thou also art his
son. And one of the spirits of Beliar wrought with me, saying, Take this sword, and with it
slay Joseph; so shall thy father love thee when he is slain. This is the spirit of anger that
counselled me, that even as a leopard devoureth a kid, so should I devour Joseph. But the
God of Jacob our father gave him not over into my hands that I should find him alone, nor
suffered me to work this iniquity, that two tribes should be destroyed in Israel.139</p>
<p>2. And now, my children, I am dying, and I tell you of a truth, that unless ye keep
yourselves from the spirit of lying and of anger, and love truth and long-suffering, ye shall
perish. There is blindness in anger, my children, and no wrathful man regardeth any person
with truth: for though it be a father or a mother, he behaveth towards them as enemies;
though it be a brother, he knoweth him not; though it be a prophet of the Lord, he disobeyeth
him; though a righteous man, he regardeth him not; a friend he doth not acknowledge. For
the spirit of anger encompasseth him with the nets of deceit, and blindeth his natural eyes,
and through lying darkeneth his mind, and giveth him a sight of his own making. And
wherewith encompasseth he his eyes? In hatred of heart; and he giveth him a heart of his
own against his brother unto envy.</p>
<p>3. My children, mischievous is anger, for it becometh as a soul to the soul itself; and
the body of the angry man it maketh its own, and over his soul it getteth the mastery, and
it bestoweth upon the body its own power, that it may work all iniquity; and whenever the
soul doeth aught, it justifieth what has been done, since it seeth not. Therefore he who is
wrathful, if he be a mighty man, hath a treble might in his anger; one by the might and aid
of his servants, and a second by his wrath, whereby he persuadeth and overcometh in injustice:
and having a third of the nature of his own body, and of his own self working the
evil. And though the wrathful man be weak, yet hath he a might twofold of that which is
by nature; for wrath ever aideth such in mischief. This spirit goeth always with lying at the
right hand of Satan, that his works may be wrought with cruelty and lying.</p>
<note type="footnote">139 [The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.]</note>

<pb n="48"/>
<p>4. Understand ye therefore the might of wrath, that it is vain. For it first of all stingeth
him in word: then by deeds it strengtheneth him who is angry, and with bitter punishments
disturbeth his mind, and so stirreth up with great wrath his soul. Therefore, when any one
speaketh against you, be not140 ye moved unto anger. And if any man praiseth you as good,
be not lifted up nor elated, either to the feeling or showing of pleasure.141 For first it pleaseth
the hearing, and so stirreth up the understanding to understand the grounds for anger; and
then, being wrathful, he thinketh that he is justly angry. If ye fall into any loss or ruin, my
children, be not troubled; for this very spirit maketh men desire that which hath perished,
in order that they may be inflamed by the desire. If ye suffer loss willingly, be not vexed,
for from vexation he raiseth up wrath with lying. And wrath with lying is a twofold mischief;
142 and they speak one with another that they may disturb the mind; and when the
soul is continually disturbed, the Lord departeth from it, and Beliar ruleth over it.</p>
<p>5. Observe, therefore, my children, the commandments of the Lord, and keep His law;
and depart from wrath, and hate lying, that the Lord may dwell among you, and Beliar may
flee from you. Speak truth each one with his neighbour, so shall ye not fall into lust and
confusion; but ye shall be in peace, having the God of peace, so143 shall no war prevail over
you. Love the Lord through all your life, and one another with a true heart. For I know
that in the last days ye will depart from the Lord, and will provoke Levi unto anger, and will
fight against Judah; but ye shall not prevail against them. For an angel of the Lord shall
guide them both; for by them shall Israel stand. And whensoever ye depart from the Lord,
ye will walk in all evil, working the abominations of the Gentiles, going144 astray with women
of them that are ungodly; and the spirits of error shall work in you with all malice. For I
have read in the book of Enoch the righteous, that your prince is Satan, and that all the
spirits of fornication and pride shall be subject unto Levi, to lay a snare for the sons of Levi,
to cause them to sin before the Lord. And my sons will draw near unto Levi, and sin with
them in all things; and the sons of Judah will be covetous, plundering other men’s goods
like lions. Therefore shall ye be led away with them in captivity, and there shall ye receive
all the plagues of Egypt, and all the malice of the Gentiles: and so, when ye return to the
Lord, ye shall obtain mercy, and He shall bring you into His sanctuary, calling peace upon
you; and there shall arise unto you from the tribe of Judah and of Levi the salvation of the
Lord;145 and He shall make war against Beliar, and He shall give the vengeance of victory

to our coasts. And the captivity shall He take from Beliar, even the souls of the saints, and
shall turn disobedient hearts unto the Lord, and shall give to them who call upon Him
everlasting peace; and the saints shall rest in Eden, and the righteous shall rejoice in the new
Jerusalem, which shall be unto the glory of God for ever and ever. And no longer shall Jerusalem
endure desolation, nor Israel be led captive; for the Lord shall be in the midst of her,
dwelling among men,146 even the Holy One of Israel reigning over them147 in humility and
in poverty;148 and he who believeth on Him shall reign in truth in the heavens.</p>
<p>6. And now, my children, fear the Lord, and take heed unto yourselves of Satan and
his spirits; and draw near unto God, and to the Angel149 that intercedeth for you, for He is
a Mediator between God and man for the peace of Israel. He shall stand up against the
kingdom of the enemy; therefore is the enemy eager to destroy all that call upon the Lord.
For he knoweth that in the day on which Israel shall believe,150 the kingdom of the enemy
shall be brought to an end; and the very angel of peace shall strengthen Israel, that it fall not
into the extremity of evil. And it shall be in the time of the iniquity of Israel, that the Lord
will depart from them, and will go after him that doeth His will, for unto none of His angels
shall it be as unto him. And His name shall be in every place of Israel, and among the
Gentiles—Saviour. Keep therefore yourselves, my children, from every evil work, and cast
away wrath and all lying, and love truth and long-suffering; and the things which ye have
heard from your father, do ye also impart to your children, that the Father of the Gentiles
may receive you: for He is true and long-suffering, meek and lowly, and teacheth by His
works the law of God. Depart, therefore, from all unrighteousness, and cleave unto the
righteousness of the law of the Lord: and bury me near my fathers.</p>
<p>7. And when he had said these things he kissed them, and slept the long sleep.151 And
his sons buried him, and after that they carried up his bones to the side of Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob. Nevertheless, as Dan had prophesied unto them that they should forget
the law of their God, and should be alienated from the land of their inheritance, and from
the race of Israel, and from their kindred, so also it came to pass.</p>

<head>VIII.—The Testament of Naphtali Concerning Natural Goodness.</head>
<p>1. The record of the testament of Naphtali, what things he ordained at the time of his
death in the hundred and thirty-second year of his life. When his sons were gathered together
in the seventh month, the fourth day of the month, he, being yet in good health, made them
a feast and good cheer. And after he was awake in the morning, he said to them, I am dying;
and they believed him not. And he blessed the Lord; and affirmed that after yesterday’s
feast he should die. He began then to say to his sons: Hear, my children; ye sons of Naphtali,
hear the words of your father. I was born from Bilhah; and because Rachel dealt craftily,
and gave Bilhah in place of herself to Jacob, and she bore me upon Rachel’s lap, therefore
was I called Naphtali.152 And Rachel loved me because I was born upon her lap; and when
I was of young and tender form, she was wont to kiss me, and say, Would that I might see
a brother of thine from my own womb, like unto thee: whence also Joseph was like unto
me in all things, according to the prayers of Rachel. Now my mother was Bilhah, daughter
of Rotheus the brother of Deborah, Rebecca’s nurse, and she was born on one and the selfsame
day with Rachel. And Rotheus was of the family of Abraham, a Chaldean, fearing
God, free-born and noble; and he was taken captive, and was bought by Laban; and he gave
him Aena his handmaid to wife, and she bore a daughter, and called her Zilpah, after the
name of the village in which he had been taken captive. And next she bore Bilhah, saying,
My daughter is eager after what is new, for immediately that she was born she was eager for
the breast.</p>
<p>2. And since I was swift on my feet like a deer, my father Jacob appointed me for all
errands and messages, and as a deer153 did he give me his blessing. For as the potter knoweth
the vessel, what it containeth, and bringeth clay thereto, so also doth the Lord make the
body in accordance with the spirit, and according to the capacity of the body doth He implant
the spirit, and the one is not deficient from the other by a third part of a hair; for by weight,
and measure, and rule is every creature of the Most High.154 And as the potter knoweth
the use of each vessel, whereto it sufficeth, so also doth the Lord know the body, how far it
is capable for goodness, and when it beginneth in evil; for there is no created thing and no
thought which the Lord knoweth not, for He created every man after His own image. As
man’s strength, so also is his work; and as his mind, so also is his work; and as his purpose,
so also is his doing; as his heart, so also is his mouth; as his eye, so also is his sleep; as his
soul, so also is his word, either in the law of the Lord or in the law of Beliar. And as there
is a division between light and darkness, between seeing and hearing, so also is there a division

between man and man, and between woman and woman; neither is it to be said that there
is any superiority in anything, either of the face or of other like things.155 For God made
all things good in their order, the five senses in the head, and He joineth on the neck to the
head, the hair also for comeliness, the heart moreover for understanding, the belly for the
dividing of the stomach, the calamus156 for health, the liver for wrath, the gall for bitterness.
the spleen for laughter, the reins for craftiness, the loins for power, the ribs for containing,
the back for strength, and so forth. So then, my children, be ye orderly unto good things in
the fear of God, and do nothing disorderly in scorn or out of its due season. For if thou bid
the eye to hear, it cannot; so neither in darkness can ye do the works of light.</p>
<p>3. Be ye not therefore eager to corrupt your doings through excess, or with empty words
to deceive your souls; because if ye keep silence in purity of heart, ye shall be able to hold
fast the will of God, and to cast away the will of the devil. Sun and moon and stars change
not their order; so also ye shall not change the law of God in the disorderliness of your doings.
Nations went astray, and forsook the Lord, and changed their order, and followed
stones and stocks, following after spirits of error. But ye shall not be so, my children, recognising
in the firmament, in the earth, and in the sea, and in all created things, the Lord who
made them all, that ye become not as Sodom, which changed the order of its nature, in like
manner also the Watchers157 changed the order of their nature, whom also the Lord cursed
at the flood, and for their sakes made desolate the earth, that it should be uninhabited and
fruitless.</p>
<p>4. These things I say, my children, for I have read in the holy writing of Enoch that ye
yourselves also will depart from the Lord, walking according to all wickedness of the Gentiles,
and ye will do according to all the iniquity of Sodom. And the Lord will bring captivity
upon you, and there shall ye serve your enemies, and ye shall be covered with all affliction
and tribulation, until the Lord shall have consumed you all. And after that ye shall have
been diminished and made few, ye will return and acknowledge the Lord your God; and He
will bring you back into your own land, according to His abundant mercy. And it shall be,
after that they shall come into the land of their fathers, they will again forget the Lord and
deal wickedly; and the Lord shall scatter them upon the face of all the earth, until the compassion
of the Lord shall come, a Man working righteousness and showing mercy unto all
them that are afar off, and them that are near.</p>

<p>5. For in the fortieth year of my life, I saw in a vision that the sun and the moon were
standing still on the Mount of Olives, at the east of Jerusalem. And behold Isaac, the father
of my father, saith to us, Run and lay hold of them, each one according to his strength; and
he that seizeth them, his shall be the sun and the moon. And we all of us ran together, and
Levi laid hold of the sun, and Judah outstripped the others and seized the moon, and they
were both of them lifted up with them. And when Levi became as a sun, a certain young
man gave to him twelve branches of palm; and Judah was bright as the moon, and under
his feet were twelve rays. And Levi and Judah ran, and laid hold each of the other. And, lo,
a bull upon the earth, having two great horns, and an eagle’s wings upon his back; and we
wished to seize him, but could not. For Joseph outstripped us, and took him, and ascended
up with him on high. And I saw, for I was there, and behold a holy writing appeared to us
saying: Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Elamites, Gelachæans, Chaldeans, Syrians, shall possess
in captivity the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>6. And again, after seven months, I saw our father Jacob standing by the sea of Jamnia,
and we his sons were with him. And, behold, there came a ship sailing by, full of dried flesh,
without sailors or pilot: and there was written upon the ship, Jacob. And our father saith
to us, Let us embark on our ship. And when we had gone on board, there arose a vehement
storm, and a tempest of mighty wind; and our father, who was holding the helm, flew away
from us. And we, being tost with the tempest, were borne along over the sea; and the ship
was filled with water and beaten about with a mighty wave, so that it was well-nigh broken
in pieces. And Joseph fled away upon a little boat, and we all were divided upon twelve
boards, and Levi and Judah were together. We therefore all were scattered even unto afar
off. Then Levi, girt about with sackcloth, prayed for us all unto the Lord. And when the
storm ceased, immediately the ship reached the land, as though in peace. And, lo, Jacob
our father came, and we rejoiced with one accord.</p>
<p>7. These two dreams I told to my father; and he said to me, These things must be fulfilled
in their season, after that Israel hath endured many things. Then my father saith unto me,
I believe that Joseph liveth, for I see always that the Lord numbereth him with you. And he
said, weeping, Thou livest, Joseph, my child, and I behold thee not, and thou seest not Jacob
that begat thee. And he caused us also to weep at these words of his, and I burned in my
heart to declare that he had been sold, but I feared my brethren.</p>
<p>8. Behold, my children, I have shown unto you the last times, that all shall come to pass
in Israel. Do ye also therefore charge your children that they be united to Levi and to Judah.
For through Judah shall salvation arise unto Israel, and in Him shall Jacob be blessed. For
through his tribe shall God be seen dwelling among men on the earth, to save the race of
Israel, and He shall gather together the righteous from the Gentiles. If ye work that which
is good, my children, both men and angels will bless you; and God will be glorified through
you among the Gentiles, and the devil will flee from you, and the wild beasts will fear you,

<pb n="53"/>
and the angels will cleave to you. For as if a man rear up a child well, he hath a kindly remembrance
thereof; so also for a good work there is a good remembrance with God. But
him who doeth not that which is good, men and angels shall curse and God will be dishonoured
among the heathen through him, and the devil maketh him his own as his peculiar
instrument, and every wild beast shall master him, and the Lord will hate him. For the
commandments of the law are twofold, and through prudence must they be fulfilled. For
there is a season for a man to embrace his wife, and a season to abstain therefrom158 for his
prayer. So then there are two commandments; and unless they be done in due order, they
bring about sin. So also is it with the other commandments. Be ye therefore wise in God,
and prudent, understanding the order of the commandments, and the laws of every work,
that the Lord may love you.</p>
<p>9. And when he had charged them with many such words, he exhorted them that they
should remove his bones to Hebron, and should bury him with his fathers. And when he
had eaten and drunken with a merry heart, he covered his face and died. And his sons did
according to all things whatsoever Naphtali their father had charged them.</p>

<head>IX.—The Testament of Gad Concerning Hatred.</head>
<p>1. The record of the testament of Gad, what things he spake unto his sons, in the hundred
and twenty-seventh year of his life, saying: I was the seventh son born to Jacob, and I was
valiant in keeping the flocks. I guarded at night the flock; and whenever the lion came, or
wolf, or leopard, or bear, or any wild beast against the fold, I pursued it, and with my hand
seizing its foot, and whirling it round, I stunned it, and hurled it over two furlongs, and so
killed it. Now Joseph was feeding the flock with us for about thirty days, and being tender,
he fell sick by reason of the heat. And he returned to Hebron to his father, who made him
lie down near him, because he loved him. And Joseph told our father that the sons of Zilpah
and Bilhah were slaying the best of the beasts,159 and devouring them without the knowledge
of Judah and Reuben. For he saw that I delivered a lamb out of the mouth of the bear, and
I put the bear to death; and the lamb I slew, being grieved concerning it that it could not
live, and we ate it, and he told our father. And I was wroth with Joseph for that thing until
the day that he was sold into Egypt. And the spirit of hatred was in me, and I wished not
either to see Joseph or to hear him. And he rebuked us to our faces for having eaten of the
flock without Judah. And whatsoever things he told our father, he believed him.</p>
<p>2. I confess now my sin, my children, that oftentimes I wished to kill him, because I
hated him to the death, and there were in no wise in me bowels of mercy towards him.
Moreover, I hated him yet more because of his dreams; and I would have devoured him out
of the land of the living, even as a calf devoureth the grass from the earth. Therefore I and
Judah sold him to the Ishmaelites for thirty160 pieces of gold, and ten of them we hid, and
showed the twenty to our brethren: and so through my covetousness I was fully bent on
his destruction. And the God of my fathers delivered him from my hands, that I should not
work iniquity in Israel.</p>
<p>3. And now, my children, hearken to the words of truth to work righteousness, and all
the law of the Most High, and not go astray through the spirit of hatred, for it is evil in all
the doings of men. Whatsoever a man doeth, that doth the hater abhor: though he worketh
the law of the Lord, he praiseth him not; though he feareth the Lord, and taketh pleasure in
that which is righteous, he loveth him not: he dispraiseth the truth, he envieth him that
ordereth his way aright, he delighteth in evil-speaking, he loveth arrogance, for hatred hath
blinded his soul; even as I also looked on Joseph.</p>
<p>4. Take heed therefore, my children, of hatred; for it worketh iniquity against the Lord
Himself: for it will not hear the words of His commandments concerning the loving of
<note type="footnote">159 Cf. Targum Ps. Jon. of Gen. xxxvii. 2.</note>

one’s neighbour, and it sinneth against God. For if a brother stumble, immediately it
wisheth to proclaim it to all men, and is urgent that he should be judged for it, and be punished
and slain. And if it be a servant, it accuseth him to his master, and with all affliction
it deviseth against him, if it be possible to slay him. For hatred worketh in envy, and it ever
sickeneth with envy against them that prosper in well-doing, when it seeth or heareth
thereof. For as love would even restore to life the dead, and would call back them that are
condemned to die, so hatred would slay the living, and those that have offended in a small
matter it would not suffer to live. For the spirit of hatred worketh together with Satan
through hastiness161 of spirit in all things unto men’s death; but the spirit of love worketh
together with the law of God in long-suffering unto the salvation of men.162</p>
<p>5. Hatred is evil, because it continually abideth with lying, speaking against the truth;
and it maketh small things to be great, and giveth heed to darkness as to light, and calleth
the sweet bitter, and teacheth slander, and war, and violence, and every excess of evil; and
it filleth the heart with devilish poison. And these things I say to you from experience, my
children, that ye may flee hatred, and cleave to the love of the Lord. Righteousness casteth
out hatred, humility destroyeth hatred. For he that is just and humble is ashamed to do
wrong, being reproved not of another, but of his own heart, because the Lord vieweth his
intent: he speaketh not against any man, because the fear of the Most High overcometh
hatred. For, fearing lest he should offend the Lord, he will not do any wrong to any man,
no, not even in thought. These things I learnt at last, after that I had repented concerning
Joseph. For true repentance after a godly sort destroyeth unbelief, and driveth away the
darkness, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth knowledge to the soul, and guideth the mind
to salvation; and those things which it hath not learnt from man, it knoweth through repent-
ance. For God brought upon me a disease of the heart; and had not the prayers of Jacob
my father intervened, it had hardly failed that my spirit had departed. For by what things
a man transgresseth, by the same also is he punished.163 For in that my heart was set mercilessly
against Joseph, in my heart too I suffered mercilessly, and was judged for eleven
months, for so long a time as I had been envious against Joseph until he was sold.</p>
<p>6. And now, my children, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your
hearts, loving one another in deed, and in word, and in thought of the soul. For in the
presence of our father I spake peaceably with Joseph; and when I had gone out, the spirit of
hatred darkened my mind, and moved my soul to slay him. 164Love ye therefore one another

from your hearts; and if a man sin against thee, tell him of it gently, and drive out the poison
of hatred, and foster not guile in thy soul. And if he confess and repent, forgive him; and
if he deny it, strive not with him, lest he swear, and thou sin doubly. Let not a stranger hear
your secrets amid your striving, lest he hate and become thy enemy, and work great sin
against thee; for ofttimes he will talk guilefully165 with thee, or evilly overreach thee, taking
his poison from himself. Therefore, if he deny it, and is convicted and put to shame, and
is silenced, do not tempt him on. For he who denieth repenteth, so that he no more doeth
wrong against thee; yea also, he will honour thee, and fear thee, and be at peace with thee.
But if he be shameless, and abideth in his wrongdoing, even then forgive him from the heart,
and give the vengeance to God.</p>
<p>7. If a man prospereth more than you, be not grieved, but pray also for him, that he
may have perfect prosperity. For perchance it is expedient for you thus; and if he be further
exalted, be not envious, remembering that all flesh shall die: and offer praise to God, who
giveth things good and profitable to all men. Seek out the judgments of the Lord, and so
shall thy mind rest and be at peace. And though a man become rich by evil means, even as
Esau the brother of my father, be not jealous; but wait for the end of the Lord. For either
He taketh His benefits away from the wicked, or leaveth them still to the repentant, or to
the unrepentant reserveth punishment for ever. For the poor man who is free from envy,
giving thanks to the Lord in all things, is rich among all men, because he hath not evil jealousy
of men. Put away, therefore, hatred from your souls, and love one another with uprightness
of heart.</p>
<p>8. And do ye also tell these things to your children, that they honour Judah and Levi,
for from them shall the Lord raise up a Saviour to Israel.166 For I know that at the last your
children shall depart from them, and shall walk in all wickedness, and mischief, and corruption
before the Lord. And when he had rested for a little while, he said again to them, My
children, obey your father, and bury me near to my fathers. And he drew up his feet, and
fell asleep in peace. And after five years they carried him up, and laid him in Hebron with
his fathers.</p>

<head>X.—The Testament of Asher Concerning Two Faces of Vice and Virtue.</head>
<p>1. The record of the testament of Asher, what things he spake to his sons in the hundred
and twentieth year of his life. While he was still in health, he said to them: Hearken, ye
children of Asher, to your father, and I will declare to you all that is right in the sight of
God. Two ways167 hath God given to the sons of men, and two minds, and two doings, and
two places, and two ends. Therefore all things are by twos, one corresponding to the other.
There are two ways of good and evil, with which are the two minds in our breasts distinguishing
them. Therefore if the soul take pleasure in good, all its actions are in righteousness;
and though it sin, it straightway repenteth. For, having his mind set upon righteousness,
and casting away maliciousness, he straightway overthroweth the evil, and uprooteth the
sin. But if his mind turn aside in evil, all his doings are in maliciousness, and he driveth
away the good, and taketh unto him the evil, and is ruled by Beliar; and even though he
work what is good, he perverteth it in evil. For whenever he beginneth as though to do
good, he bringeth the end of his doing to work evil, seeing that the treasure of the devil is
filled with the poison of an evil spirit.</p>
<p>2. There is then, he saith, a soul which speaketh the good for the sake of the evil, and
the end of the doing leadeth to mischief.168 There is a man who showeth no compassion
upon him who serveth his turn in evil; and this thing hath two aspects, but the whole is evil.
And there is a man that loveth him that worketh evil; he likewise dwelleth in evil, because
he chooseth even to die in an evil cause for his sake: and concerning this it is clear that it
hath two aspects, but the whole is an evil work. And though there is love, it is but wickedness
concealing the evil, even as it beareth a name that seemeth good, but the end of the doing
tendeth unto evil. Another stealeth, worketh unjustly, plundereth, defraudeth, and withal
pitieth the poor: this, too, hath a twofold aspect, but the whole is evil. Defrauding his
neighbour he provoketh God, and sweareth falsely against the Most High, and yet pitieth
the poor: the Lord who commandeth the law he setteth at nought and provoketh, and refresheth
the poor; he defileth the soul, and maketh gay the body; he killeth many, and he
pitieth a few: and this, too, hath a twofold aspect. Another committeth adultery and fornication,
and abstaineth from meats; yet in his fasting he worketh evil, and by his power and
his wealth perverteth many, and out of his excessive wickedness worketh the commandments:
this, too, hath a twofold aspect, but the whole is evil. Such men are as swine or hares;169
for they are half clean, but in very deed are unclean. For God in the Heavenly170 Tablets
hath thus declared.</p>

<p>3. Do not ye therefore, my children, wear two faces like unto them, of goodness and of
wickedness; but cleave unto goodness only, for in goodness doth God rest, and men desire
it. From wickedness flee away, destroying the devil by your good works; for they that are
double-faced serve not God, but their own lusts, so that they may please Beliar and men like
unto themselves.</p>
<p>4. For good men, even they that are single of face, though they be thought by them that
are double-faced to err, are just before God. For many in killing the wicked do two works,
an evil by a good; but the whole is good, because he hath uprooted and destroyed that which
is evil. One man hateth him that showeth mercy, and doeth wrong to the adulterer and the
thief: this, too, is double-faced, but the whole work is good, because he followeth the Lord’s
example, in that he receiveth not that which seemeth good with that which is really bad.171
Another desireth not to see good days with them that riot, lest he defile his mouth and pollute
his soul: this, too, is double-faced, but the whole is good, for such men are like to stags and
to hinds, because in a wild condition they seem to be unclean, but they are altogether clean;
because they walk in a zeal for God, and abstain from what God also hateth and forbiddeth
by His commandments, and they ward off the evil from the good.</p>
<p>5. Ye see therefore, my children, how that there are two in all things, one against the
other, and the one is hidden by the other.172 Death succeedeth to life, dishonour to glory,
night to day, and darkness to light; and all things are under the day, and just things under
life: wherefore also everlasting life awaiteth death. Nor may it be said that truth is a lie, nor
right wrong; for all truth is under the light, even as all things are under God. All these things
I proved in my life, and I wandered not from the truth of the Lord, and I searched out the
commandments of the Most High, walking with singleness of face according to all my
strength unto that which is good.</p>
<p>6. Take heed therefore ye also, my children, to the commandments of the Lord, following
the truth with singleness of face, for they that are double-faced receive twofold punishment.
Hate the spirits of error, which strive against men. Keep the law of the Lord, and give not
heed unto evil as unto good; but look unto the thing that is good indeed, and keep it in all
commandments of the Lord, having your conversation unto Him, and resting in Him: for
the ends at which men aim do show their righteousness, and know the angels of the Lord
from the angels of Satan. For if the soul depart troubled, it is tormented by the evil spirit
which also it served in lusts and evil works; but if quietly and with joy it hath known the
angel of peace, it shall comfort him in life.</p>

and in peace breaking the head of the dragon through water. He shall save Israel and all
nations, God speaking in the person of man. Therefore tell ye these things to your children,
that they disobey Him not. For I have read in the Heavenly Tablets that in very deed ye will
disobey Him, and act ungodly against Him, not giving heed to the law of God, but to the
commandments of men. Therefore shall ye be scattered as Gad and as Dan my brethren,
who shall know not their own lands, tribe, and tongue. But the Lord will gather you together
in faith through the hope of His tender mercy, for the sake of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob.173</p>

<head>XI.—The Testament of Joseph Concerning Sobriety.</head>
<p>1. The record of the testament of Joseph. When he was about to die he called his sons
and his brethren together, and said to them: My children and brethren, hearken to Joseph
the beloved of Israel; give ear, my sons, unto your father. I have seen in my life envy and
death, and I wandered not in the truth of the Lord. These my brethren hated me, and the
Lord loved me: they wished to slay me, and the God of my fathers guarded me: they let me
down into a pit, and the Most High brought me up again: I was sold for a slave, and the
Lord made me free: I was taken into captivity, and His strong hand succoured me: I was
kept in hunger, and the Lord Himself nourished me: I was alone, and God comforted me:
I was sick, and the Most High visited me: I was in prison, and the Saviour showed favour
unto me; in bonds, and He released me; amid slanders, and He pleaded my cause; amid
bitter words of the Egyptians, and He rescued me; amid envy and guile, and He exalted me.</p>
<p>2. And thus Potiphar174 the chief cook175 of Pharaoh entrusted to me his house, and
I struggled against a shameless woman, urging me to transgress with her; but the God of
Israel my father guarded me from the burning flame. I was cast into prison, I was beaten,
I was mocked; and the Lord granted me to find pity in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
For He will in no wise forsake them that fear Him, neither in darkness, nor in bonds, nor
in tribulations, nor in necessities. For not as man is God ashamed, nor as the son of man
is He afraid, nor as one that is earth-born is He weak, or can He be thrust aside; but in all
places is He at hand, and in divers ways doth He comfort, departing for a little to try the
purpose of the soul. In ten temptations He showed me approved, and in all of them I endured;
for endurance is a mighty charm, and patience giveth many good things.</p>
<p>3. How often did the Egyptian threaten me with death! How often did she give me over
to punishment, and then call me back, and threaten me when I would not company with
her! And she said to me, Thou shalt be lord of me, and all that is mine, if thou wilt give
thyself unto me, and thou shalt be as our master. Therefore I remembered the words of the
fathers of my father Jacob, and I entered into my chamber176 and prayed unto the Lord;
and I fasted in those seven years, and I appeared to my master as one living delicately, for
they that fast for God’s sake receive beauty of face.177 And if one gave me wine, I drank it

not; and I fasted for three days, and took my food and gave it to the poor and sick. And I
sought the Lord early, and wept for the Egyptian woman of Memphis, for very unceasingly
did she trouble me, and at night she came to me under the pretence of visiting me; and at
first, because she had no male child, she feigned to count me as a son. And I prayed unto
the Lord, and she bare a male child; therefore for a time she embraced me as a son, and I
knew it not. Last of all, she sought to draw me into fornication. And when I perceived it,
I sorrowed even unto death; and when she had gone out I came to myself, and I lamented
for her many days, because I saw her guile and her deceit. And I declared unto her the words
of the Most High, if haply she would turn from her evil lust.</p>
<p>4. How often has she fawned upon me with words as a holy man, with guile in her talk,
praising my chastity before her husband, while desiring to destroy me when we were alone.
She lauded me openly as chaste, and in secret she said unto me, Fear not my husband; for
he is persuaded concerning thy chastity, so that even should one tell him concerning us he
would in no wise believe. For all these things I lay upon the ground in sackcloth, and I besought
God that the Lord would deliver me from the Egyptian. And when she prevailed
nothing, she came again to me under the plea of instruction, that she might know the word
of the Lord. And she said unto me, If thou willest that I should leave my idols, be persuaded
by me, and I will persuade my husband to depart from his idols, and we will walk in the law
of thy Lord. And I said unto her, The Lord willeth not that those who reverence Him should
be in uncleanness, nor doth He take pleasure in them that commit adultery. And she held
her peace, longing to accomplish her evil desire. And I gave myself yet more to fasting and
prayer, that the Lord should deliver me from her.</p>
<p>5. And again at another time she said unto me, If thou wilt not commit adultery, I will
kill my husband, and so will I lawfully take thee to be my husband. I therefore, when I heard
this, rent my garment, and said, Woman, reverence the Lord, and do not this evil deed, lest
thou be utterly destroyed; for I will declare thy ungodly thought unto all men. She therefore,
being afraid, besought that I would declare to no one her wickedness. And she departed,
soothing me with gifts, and sending to me every delight of the sons of men.</p>
<p>6. And she sendeth to me food sprinkled with enchantments. And when the eunuch
who brought it came, I looked up and beheld a terrible man giving me with the dish a sword,
and I perceived that her scheme was for the deception of my soul. And when he had gone
out I wept, nor did I taste that or any other of her food. So then after one day she came to
me and observed the food, and said unto me, What is this, that thou hast not eaten of the
food? And I said unto her, It is because thou filledst it with death; and how saidst thou, I
come not near to idols but to the Lord alone? Now therefore know that the God of my
father hath revealed unto me by an angel thy wickedness, and I have kept it to convict thee,
if haply thou mayest see it and repent. But that thou mayest learn that the wickedness of
the ungodly hath no power over them that reverence God in chastity, I took it and ate it

<pb n="62"/>
before her, saying, The God of my fathers and the Angel of Abraham shall be with me. And
she fell upon her face at my feet, and wept; and I raised her up and admonished her, and
she promised to do this iniquity no more.</p>
<p>7. But because her heart was set upon me to commit lewdness, she sighed, and her
countenance fell. And when her husband saw her, he said unto her, Why is thy countenance
fallen? And she said, I have a pain at my heart, and the groanings of my spirit do oppress
me; and so he comforted her who was not sick. Then she rushed in to me while her husband
was yet without, and said unto me, I will hang myself, or cast myself into a well or over a
cliff, if thou wilt not consent unto me. And when I saw the spirit of Beliar was troubling
her, I prayed unto the Lord, and said unto her, Why art thou troubled and disturbed, blinded
in sins? Remember that if thou killest thyself, Sethon, the concubine of thy husband, thy
rival, will beat thy children, and will destroy thy memorial from off the earth. And she said
unto me, Lo then thou lovest me; this alone is sufficient for me, that thou carest for my life
and my children: I have expectation that I shall enjoy my desire. And she knew not that
because of my God I spake thus, and not because of her. For if a man hath fallen before the
passion of a wicked desire, then by that hath he become enslaved, even as also was she. And
if he hear any good thing with regard to the passion whereby he is vanquished, he receiveth
it unto his wicked desire.</p>
<p>8. I declare unto you, my children, that it was about the sixth hour when she departed
from me; and I knelt before the Lord all that day, and continued all the night; and about
dawn I rose up weeping, and praying for a release from the Egyptian. At last, then, she laid
hold of my garments, forcibly dragging me to have connection with her. When, therefore,
I saw that in her madness she was forcibly holding my garments, I fled away naked. And
she falsely accused me to her husband, and the Egyptian cast me into the prison in his house;
and on the morrow, having scourged me, the Egyptian178 sent me into the prison in his
house. When, therefore, I was in fetters, the Egyptian woman fell sick from her vexation,
and listened to me how I sang praises unto the Lord while I was in the abode of darkness,
and with glad voice rejoiced and glorified my God only because by a pretext I had been rid
of the Egyptian woman.</p>
<p>9. How often hath she sent unto me, saying, Consent to fulfil my desire, and I will release
thee from thy bonds, and I will free time from the darkness! And not even in thoughts did
I incline unto her. For God loveth him who in a den of darkness fasteth with chastity, rather
than him who in secret chambers liveth delicately without restraint. And whosoever liveth
in chastity, and desireth also glory, and if the Most High knoweth that it is expedient for
him, He bestoweth this also upon him, even as upon me. How often, though she were sick,
did she come down to me at unlooked-for times, and listened to my voice as I prayed! And
<note type="footnote">178 This repetition of a clause seems like the slip of a copyist. The Ox. ms. reads, εἰς τὴν εἱρκτὴν τοῦ Φαραώ</note>

<pb n="63"/>
when I heard her groanings I held my peace. For when I was in her house she was wont to
bare her arms, and breasts, and legs, that I might fall before her; for she was very beautiful,
splendidly adorned for my deception. And the Lord guarded me from her devices.179</p>
<p>10. Ye see therefore, my children, how great things patience worketh, and prayer with
fasting. And if ye therefore follow after sobriety and purity in patience and humility of
heart, the Lord will dwell among you, because He loveth sobriety. And wheresoever the
Most High dwelleth, even though a man fall into envy, or slavery, or slander, the Lord who
dwelleth in him, for his sobriety’s sake not only delivereth him from evil, but also exalteth
and glorifieth him, even as me. For in every way the man is guarded, whether in deed, or
in word, or in thought. My brethren know how my father loved me, and I was not exalted
in my heart; although I was a child, I had the fear of God in my thoughts. For I knew that
all things should pass away, and I kept myself within bounds, and I honoured my brethren;
and through fear of them I held my peace when I was sold, and revealed not my family to
the Ishmaelites, that I was the son of Jacob, a great man and a mighty.</p>
<p>11. Do ye also, therefore, have the fear of God in your works, and honour your brethren.
For every one who worketh the law of the Lord shall be loved by Him. And when I came
to the Indocolpitæ with the Ishmaelites, they asked me, and I said that I was a slave from
their house, that I might not put my brethren to shame. And the eldest of them said unto
me, Thou art not a slave, for even thy appearance doth make it manifest concerning thee.
And he threatened me even unto death. But I said that I was their slave. Now when we
came into Egypt, they strove concerning me, which of them should buy me and take me.
Therefore it seemed good to all that I should remain in Egypt with a merchant of their trade,
until they should return bringing merchandise. And the Lord gave me favour in the eyes
of the merchant, and he entrusted unto me his house. And the Lord blessed him by my
means, and increased him in silver and gold, and I was with him three months and five days.</p>
<p>12. About that time the Memphian wife of Potiphar passed by with great pomp, and
cast her eyes upon me, because her eunuchs told her concerning me. And she told her
husband concerning the merchant, that he had become rich by means of a young Hebrew,
saying, And they say that men have indeed stolen him out of the land of Canaan. Now
therefore execute judgment with him, and take away the youth to be thy steward; so shall
the God of the Hebrews bless thee, for grace from heaven is upon him.</p>
<p>13. And Potiphar was persuaded by her words, and commanded the merchant to be
brought, and said unto him, What is this that I hear, that thou stealest souls out of the land
of the Hebrews, and sellest them for slaves? The merchant therefore fell upon his face, and
besought him, saying, I beseech thee, my lord, I know not what thou sayest. And he said,
Whence then is thy Hebrew servant? And he said, The Ishmaelites entrusted him to me
<note type="footnote">179 [To this section Lardner takes exception, as unbecoming to the gravity of Joseph.]</note>

<pb n="64"/>
until they should return. And he believed him not, but commanded him to be stripped and
beaten. And when he persisted, Potiphar said, Let the youth be brought. And when I was
brought in, I did obeisance to the chief of the eunuchs—for he was third in rank with Pharaoh,
being chief of all the eunuchs, and having wives and children and concubines. And he took
me apart from him, and said unto me, Art thou a slave or free? And I said, A slave. And
he said unto me, Whose slave art thou? And I said unto him, The Ishmaelites’. And again
he said unto me, How becamest thou their slave? And I said, They bought me out of the
land of Canaan. And he believed me not, and said, Thou liest: and he commanded me to
be stripped and beaten.</p>
<p>14. Now the Memphian woman was looking through a window while I was being beaten,
and she sent unto her husband, saying, Thy judgment is unjust; for thou dost even punish
a free man who hath been stolen, as though he were a transgressor. And when I gave no
other answer though I was beaten, he commanded that we should be kept in guard, until,
said he, the owners of the boy shall come. And his wife said unto him, Wherefore dost thou
detain in captivity this noble child, who ought rather to be set at liberty, and wait upon thee?
For she wished to see me in desire of sin, and I was ignorant concerning all these things.
Then said he to his wife, It is not the custom of the Egyptians to take away that which belongeth
to others before proof is given. This he said concerning the merchant, and concerning
me, that I must be imprisoned.</p>
<p>15. Now, after four and twenty days came the Ishmaelites; and having heard that Jacob
my father was mourning because of me, they said unto me, How is it that thou saidst that
thou wert a slave? and lo, we have learnt that thou art the son of a mighty man in the land
of Canaan, and thy father grieveth for thee in sackcloth. And again I would have wept, but
I restrained myself, that I should not put my brethren to shame. And I said, I know not, I
am a slave. Then they take counsel to sell me, that I should not be found in their hands.
For they feared Jacob, lest he should work upon them a deadly vengeance. For it had been
heard that he was mighty with the Lord and with men. Then said the merchant unto them,
Release me from the judgment of Potiphar. They therefore came and asked for me, saying,
He was bought by us with money. And he sent us away.</p>
<p>16. Now the Memphian woman pointed me out to her husband, that he should buy
me; for I hear, said she, that they are selling him. And she sent a eunuch to the Ishmaelites,
and asked them to sell me; and since he was not willing to traffic with them, he returned.
So when the eunuch had made trial of them, he made known to his mistress that they asked
a large price for their slave. And she sent another eunuch, saying, Even though they demand
two minæ of gold, take heed not to spare the gold; only buy the boy, and bring him hither.
And he gave them eighty pieces of gold for me, and told his mistress that a hundred had
been given for me. And when I saw it I held my peace, that the eunuch should not be punished.</p>

<pb n="65"/>
<p>17. Ye see, my children, what great things I endured that I should not put my brethren
to shame. Do ye also love one another, and with long-suffering hide ye one another’s faults.
For God delighteth in the unity of brethren, and in the purpose of a heart approved unto
love. And when my brethren came into Egypt, and learnt that I returned their money unto
them, and upbraided them not, yea, that I even comforted them, and after the death of Jacob
I loved them more abundantly, and all things whatsoever he commanded I did very
abundantly, then they marvelled. For I suffered them not to be afflicted even unto the
smallest matter; and all that was in my hand I gave unto them. Their children were my
children, and my children were as their servants; their life was my life, and all their suffering
was my suffering, and all their sickness was my infirmity. My land was their land, my
counsel their counsel, and I exalted not myself among them in arrogance because of my
worldly glory, but I was among them as one of the least.</p>
<p>18. If ye also therefore walk in the commandments of the Lord, my children, He will
exalt you there, and will bless you with good things for ever and ever. And if any one seeketh
to do evil unto you, do ye by well-doing pray for him, and ye shall be redeemed of the Lord
from all evil. For, behold, ye see that through long-suffering I took unto wife even the
daughter of my180 master. And a hundred talents of gold were given me with her; for the
Lord made them to serve me. And He gave me also beauty as a flower above the beautiful
ones of Israel; and He preserved me unto old age in strength and in beauty, because I was
like in all things to Jacob.</p>
<p>19. Hear ye also, my children, the visions which I saw. There were twelve deer feeding,
and the nine were divided and scattered in the land, likewise also the three. And I saw that
from Judah was born a virgin wearing a linen181 garment, and from her went forth a Lamb,
without spot, and on His left hand there was as it were a lion; and all the beasts rushed
against Him, and the lamb overcame them, and destroyed them, and trod them under foot.
And because of Him the angels rejoiced, and men, and all the earth. And these things shall
take place in their season, in the last days. Do ye therefore, my children, observe the commandments
of the Lord, and honour Judah and Levi; for from them shall arise unto you the
Lamb of God, by grace saving all the Gentiles and Israel. For His kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, which shall not be shaken; but my kingdom among you shall come to an end as
a watcher’s182 hammock, which after the summer will not appear.</p>
<note type="footnote">180 Another account is given in the Targ. Ps. Jon. of Gen. xli. 45, “And he gave him to wife Asenath, whom

<note type="footnote">181 This wearing of a linen garment would seem to imply a connection with the priestly tribe. St. Luke (i.

<p>20. I know that after my death the Egyptians will afflict you, but God will undertake
your cause, and will bring you into that which He promised to your fathers. But carry ye
up my bones with you;183 for when my bones are taken up, the Lord will be with you in
light, and Beliar shall be in darkness with the Egyptians. And carry ye up Zilpah your
mother, and lay her near Bilhah, by the hippodrome, by the side of Rachel.184 And when
he had said these things, he stretched out his feet, and slept the long sleep. And all Israel
bewailed him, and all Egypt, with a great lamentation. For he felt even for the Egyptians
even as his own members, and showed them kindness, aiding them in every work, and
counsel, and matter.</p>

<head>XII.—The Testament of Benjamin Concerning a Pure Mind.</head>
<p>1. The record of the words of Benjamin, which he set forth to his sons, after he had
lived a hundred and twenty years. And he kissed them, and said: As Isaac was born to
Abraham in his hundredth year, so also was I to Jacob. Now since Rachel died in giving me
birth, I had no milk; therefore I was suckled by Bilhah her handmaid. For Rachel remained
barren for twelve years after that she had borne Joseph: and she prayed the Lord with fasting
twelve days, and she conceived and bare me. For our father loved Rachel dearly, and prayed
that he might see two sons born from her: therefore was I called the son of days, which is
Benjamin.185</p>
<p>2. When therefore I went into Egypt, and Joseph my brother recognised me, he said
unto me, What did they tell my father in that they sold me? And I said unto him, They
dabbled thy coat with blood and sent it, and said, Look if this is the coat of thy son. And
he said to me, Even so, brother; for when the Ishmaelites took me, one of them stripped off
my coat, and gave me a girdle, and scourged me, and bade me run. And as he went away
to hide my garment, a lion met him, and slew him; and so his fellows were afraid, and sold
me to their companions.</p>
<p>3. Do ye also therefore, my children, love the Lord God of heaven, and keep His commandments,
and be followers of the good and holy man Joseph; and let your mind be unto
good, even as ye know me. He that hath his mind good seeth all things rightly. Fear ye the
Lord, and love your neighbour; and even though the spirits of Beliar allure you into all
troublous wickedness, yet shall no troublous wickedness have dominion over you, even as
it had not over Joseph my brother. How many men wished to slay him, and God shielded
him! For he that feareth God and loveth his neighbour cannot be smitten by Beliar’s spirit
of the air, being shielded by the fear of God; nor can he be ruled over by the device of men
or of beasts, for he is aided by the love of the Lord which he hath towards his neighbour.
For he even besought our father Jacob that he would pray for our brethren, that the Lord
would not impute to them the evil that they devised concerning Joseph. And thus Jacob
cried out, My child Joseph, thou hast prevailed over the bowels of thy father Jacob. And he
embraced him, and kissed him for two hours, saying, In thee shall be fulfilled the prophecy
of heaven concerning the Lamb of God, even the Saviour of the world, that spotless shall
He be delivered up for transgressors, and sinless186 shall He be put to death for ungodly
<note type="footnote">185 The ordinary theory as to the meaning of Benjamin is comparatively late, and seems doubtful. The Targum
Jerushalmi (on Gen. xxxv. 18), and the Breshith Rabba, § 82, make Benjamin and Benoni synonymous. Cf.
Josephus, Antiq., i. 21. 3; Cyril, Glaph. in Gen., lib. iv. With the view mentioned in the text, cf. Arethas on Rev.
vii. 8 (Cramer’s Catena, viii. 289).</note>

<pb n="68"/>
men in the blood of the covenant, for the salvation187 of the Gentiles and of Israel, and shall
destroy Beliar, and them that serve him.</p>
<p>4. Know ye, my children, the end of the good man? Be followers of his compassion in
a good mind, that ye also may wear crowns of glory. The good man hath not a dark eye;
for he showeth mercy to all men, even though they be sinners, even though they devise evil
concerning him. So he that doeth good overcometh the evil, being shielded by Him that is
good; and he loveth the righteous as his own soul. If any one is glorified, he envieth him
not; if any one is enriched, he is not jealous; if any one is valiant, he praiseth him; he trusteth
and laudeth him that is sober-minded; he showeth mercy to the poor; he is kindly disposed
toward the weak; he singeth the praises of God; as for him who hath the fear of God, he
protecteth him as with a shield; him that loveth God he aideth; him that rejecteth the Most
High he admonisheth and turneth back; and him that hath the grace of a good spirit, he
loveth even as his own soul.</p>
<p>5. If ye have a good mind, my children, then will both wicked men be at peace with
you, and the profligate will reverence you and turn unto good; and the covetous shall not
only cease from their inordinate desire, but shall even give the fruits of their covetousness
to them that are afflicted. If ye do well, even the unclean spirits shall flee from you; yea, the
very beasts shall flee from you in dread. For where the reverence for good works is present
unto the mind, darkness fleeth away from him. For if any one is injurious to a holy man,
he repenteth; for the holy man showeth pity on his reviler, and holdeth his peace. And if
any one betray a righteous soul, and the righteous man, though praying, be humbled for a
little while, yet not long after he appeareth far more glorious, even as was Joseph my
brother.</p>
<p>6. The mind of the good man is not in the power of the deceit of the spirit of Beliar, for
the angel of peace guideth his soul. He gazeth not passionately on corruptible things, nor
gathereth together riches unto desire of pleasure; he delighteth not in pleasure, he hurteth
not his neighbour, he pampereth not himself with food, he erreth not in the pride of his
eyes, for the Lord is his portion. The good mind admitteth not the glory and dishonour of
men, neither knoweth it any guile or lie, fighting or reviling; for the Lord dwelleth in him
and lighteth up his soul, and he rejoiceth towards all men at every time. The good mind
hath not two tongues, of blessing and of cursing, of insult and of honour, of sorrow and of
joy, of quietness and of trouble, of hypocrisy and of truth, of poverty and of wealth; but it
hath one disposition, pure and uncorrupt, concerning all men. It hath no double sight,188
nor double hearing; for in everything which he doeth, or speaketh, or seeth, he knoweth
<note type="footnote">187 [How could any Christian more fully testify to the Nicene Faith? So the Gloria in Excelsis.]</note>
<note type="footnote">188 [Matt. vi. 22; Luke xi. 34.]</note>

<pb n="69"/>
that the Lord watcheth his soul, and he cleanseth his mind that he be not condemned by
God and men. But of Beliar every work is twofold, and hath no singleness.</p>
<p>7. Flee ye therefore, my children, the evil-doing of Beliar; for it giveth a sword to them
that obeyeth, and the sword is the mother of seven evils. First the mind conceiveth through
Beliar, and first there is envy; secondly, desperation; thirdly, tribulation; fourthly, captivity;
fifthly, neediness; sixthly, trouble; seventhly, desolation. Therefore also Cain is delivered
over to seven vengeances by God, for in every hundred years the Lord brought one plague
upon him. Two hundred years he suffered, and in the nine hundredth year he was brought
to desolation at the flood, for Abel his righteous brother’s sake. In seven189 hundred years
was Cain judged, and Lamech in seventy times seven; because for ever those who are likened
unto Cain in envy unto hatred of brethren shall be judged with the same punishment.</p>
<p>8. Do ye also therefore, my children, flee ill-doing, envy, and hatred of brethren, and
cleave to goodness and love. He that hath a pure mind in love, looketh not after a woman
unto fornication; for he hath no defilement in his heart, because the Spirit of God resteth
in him. For as the sun is not defiled by shining over dung and mire, but rather drieth up
both and driveth away the ill smell: so also the pure mind, constrained among the defilements
of the earth, rather edifieth, and itself suffereth no defilement.</p>
<p>9. Now I suppose, from the words of the righteous Enoch, that there will be also evildoings
among you: for ye will commit fornication with the fornication of Sodom, and shall
perish all save a few, and will multiply inordinate lusts with women; and the kingdom of
the Lord shall not be among you, for forthwith He will take it away. Nevertheless the temple
of God shall be built in your portion, and shall be glorious among you. For He shall take
it, and the twelve tribes shall be gathered together there, and all the Gentiles, until the Most
High shall send forth His salvation in the visitation of His only-begotten one. And He shall
enter into the front190 of the temple, and there shall the Lord be treated with outrage, and
He shall be lifted up upon a tree. And the veil of the temple shall be rent, and the Spirit of
God shall descend upon the Gentiles as fire poured forth. And He shall arise from the grave,
and shall ascend from earth into heaven: and I know how lowly He shall be upon the earth,
and how glorious in the heaven.</p>
<p>10. Now when Joseph was in Egypt, I longed to see his visage and the form of his
countenance; and through the prayers of Jacob my father I saw him, while awake in the
daytime, in his full and perfect shape. Know ye therefore, my children, that I am dying.
Work therefore truth and righteousness each one with his neighbour, and judgment unto
faithful doing, and keep the law of the Lord and His commandments; for these things do I
teach you instead of all inheritance. Do ye also therefore give them to your children for an

<pb n="70"/>
everlasting possession; for so did both Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. All these things they
gave us for an inheritance, saying, Keep the commandments of God until the Lord shall reveal
His salvation to all nations. Then shall ye see Enoch, Noah, and Shem, and Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, arising on the right hand in gladness. Then shall we also arise, each one
over our tribe, worshipping the King of heaven, who appeared upon the earth in the form
of a man of humility. And as many as believed on Him on the earth shall rejoice with
Him;191 and then shall all men arise, some unto glory and some unto shame. And the Lord
shall judge Israel first, even for the wrong they did unto Him; for when He appeared as a
deliverer, God in the flesh, they believed Him not. And then shall He judge all the Gentiles,
as many as believed Him not when He appeared upon earth. And He shall reprove Israel
among the chosen ones of the Gentiles, even as He reproved Esau among the Midianites,
who deceived their brethren, so that they fell into fornication and idolatry; and they were
alienated from God, and became as they that were no children in the portion of them that
fear the Lord. But if ye walk in holiness in the presence of the Lord, ye shall dwell in hope
again in me, and all Israel shall be gathered unto the Lord.</p>
<p>11. And I shall no longer be called a ravening wolf192 on account of your ravages, but
a worker of the Lord, distributing food to them that work what is good. And one193 shall
rise up from my seed in the latter times, beloved of the Lord, hearing upon the earth His
voice, enlightening with new knowledge all the Gentiles, bursting in upon Israel for salvation
with the light of knowledge, and tearing it away from it like a wolf, and giving it to the synagogue
of the Gentiles. And until the consummation of the ages shall he be in the synagogues
of the Gentiles, and among their rulers, as a strain of music in the mouth of all;194 and he
shall be inscribed in the holy books, both his work and his word, and he shall be a chosen
one of God for ever; and because of him my father Jacob instructed me, saying, He shall fill
up that which lacketh of thy tribe.</p>
<p>12. And when he finished his words, he said: I charge you, my children, carry up my
bones out of Egypt, and bury me at Hebron, near my fathers. So Benjamin died a hundred
and twenty-five years old, in a good old age, and they placed him in a coffin. And in the
ninety-first year of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt, they and their brethren
brought up the bones of their fathers secretly in a place which is called Canaan; and they

<head>Note by the American Editor.</head>
<p>I had prepared annotations for these pages which I find will require more space than
this overloaded volume can afford. Let me indicate some sources of information which the
student may find convenient. Thus, in Liddon’s Bampton Lecture (4th ed., London, 1869),
consult p. 71 for remarks on Philo and Alexandrian Jews; see also p. 91. Concerning the
“Book of Enoch,” pp. 7 and 302; see Westcott, Study of the Gospels (London, 1867), p. 109,
a reference to the Book of Jubilees, and its lack of reference to Messiah. See Jewish doctrine
of the Messiah, pp. 86, 143, 151; the “Book of Henoch,” pp. 69, 93, 101; apocryphal words
of Jews, p. 428. He places the “Book of Henoch” earlier than the “Book of Jubilees,” and the
Twelve Patriarchs after that. Compare Westcott’s Historic Faith (London, 1883), a quotation
from Goldwin Smith, on “the blood of Christ,” note 8, p. 237.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear to note, among useful suggestions in these Testaments, that (on p. 11)
of the share of Simeon in the persecution of Joseph. It explains the real purpose of Joseph
in selecting Simeon as the hostage to be left in Egypt (Gen. xlii. 21–24.) Joseph heard the
mutual reproaches of his brothers, and foresaw that Simeon would be made to suffer as
most guilty: so he was withdrawn. Again, a like anxiety (Gen. xlv. 2) appears when Simeon
was sent back with them to his father. Other suggestions may be noted as substantially illustrating
the sacred narrative.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Excerpts of Theodotus; or, Selections from the Prophetic
Scriptures.</head>
<p>We may thank Mr. Wilson, the translator, for separating this collection, absolutely,
from the works of Clement of Alexandria, to which it has been made an appendix. The
reference to “our Pantænus” gives the only colour for such a collocation with so great a
name. It is the work of a Montanist, perhaps, who may have had some relations with the
Alexandrian school; but it is hard to say precisely who of three or four named Theodotus
(all heretics), may have made the compilation, more especially because disjointed and contradictory
fragments seem mixed up in it as it is commonly edited. Dupin (perhaps too
readily copying Valesius) appears to think Clement may have been the compiler, but that,
like the Hypotyposes, the work was the product of days when he was imperfectly educated
in Christian truth. It seems to me more reasonable to conclude that these excerpts, and

or,
Selections from the Prophetic Scriptures.197</head>
<p>I. Those around Sedrach, Misak, and Abednago in the furnace of fire say as they praise
God, “Bless, ye heavens, the Lord; praise and exalt Him for ever;” then, “Bless, ye angels,
the Lord;” then, “Bless the Lord, all ye waters that are above heaven.” So the Scriptures assign
the heavens and the waters to the class of pure powers198 as is shown in Genesis. Suitably,
then, inasmuch as “power” is used with a variety of meaning, Daniel adds, “Let every power
bless the Lord;” then, further, “Bless the Lord, sun and moon;” and, “Bless the Lord, ye stars
of heaven. Bless the Lord, all ye that worship Him; praise and confess the God of gods, for
His mercy is for ever.” It is written in Daniel, on the occasion of the three children praising
in the furnace.</p>
<p>II. “Blessed art Thou, who lookest on the abysses as Thou sittest on the cherubim,” says
Daniel, in agreement with Enoch,199 who said, “And I saw all sorts of matter.” For the abyss,
which is in its essence boundless, is bounded by the power of God. These material essences
then, from which the separate genera and their species are produced, are called abysses;
since you would not call the water alone the abyss, although matter is allegorically called
water, the abyss.</p>
<p>III. “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,”200 both terrestrial and celestial
things. And that this is true, the Lord said to Osee, “Go, take to thyself a wife of fornication,
and children of fornication: because the land committing fornication, shall commit
fornication, departing from the Lord.”201 For it is not the element of earth that he speaks
of, but those that dwell in the element, those who have an earthly disposition.</p>

<p>IV. And that the Son is the beginning202 or head, Hosea teaches clearly: “And it shall
be, that in the place in which it was said to them, Ye are not my people, they shall be called
the children of the living God: and the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be
gathered to the same place, and they shall place over them one head,203 and they shall come
up out of the land; for great is the day of Jezreel.”204 For whom one believes, him He chooses.
But one believes the Son, who is the head; wherefore also he said in addition: “But I will
have mercy on the sons of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God.”205 Now the
Saviour who saves is the Son of God. He is then the head.206</p>
<p>V. The Spirit by Osee says, “I am your Instructor;”207 “Blow ye208 the trumpet upon
the hills of the Lord; sound upon the high places.”209 And is not baptism itself, which is
the sign of regeneration, an escape from matter, by the teaching of the Saviour, a great impetuous
stream, ever rushing on and bearing us along? The Lord accordingly, leading us
out of disorder, illumines us by bringing us into the light, which is shadowless and is material
no longer.</p>
<p>VI. This river and sea of matter two prophets210 cut asunder and divided by the power
of the Lord, the matter being bounded, through both divisions of the water. Famous leaders
both, by whom the signs were believed, they complied with the will of God, so that the
righteous man may proceed from matter, having journeyed through it first. On the one of
these commanders also was imposed the name of our Saviour.211</p>
<p>VII. Now, regeneration is by water and spirit, as was all creation: “For the Spirit of God
moved on the abyss.”212 And for this reason the Saviour was baptized, though not Himself
needing213 to be so, in order that He might consecrate the whole water for those who were
being regenerated. Thus it is not the body only, but the soul, that we cleanse. It is accordingly

a sign of the sanctifying of our invisible part, and of the straining off from the new and
spiritual creation of the unclean spirits that have got mixed up with the soul.</p>
<p>VIII. “The water above the heaven.” Since baptism is performed by water and the
Spirit as a protection against the twofold fire,—that which lays hold of what is visible, and
that which lays hold of what is invisible; and of necessity, there being an immaterial element
of water and a material, is it a protection against the twofold214 fire. And the earthly water
cleanses the body; but the heavenly water, by reason of its being immaterial and invisible,
is an emblem of the Holy Spirit, who is the purifier of what is invisible, as the water of the
Spirit, as the other of the body.</p>
<p>IX. God, out of goodness, hath mingled fear with goodness. For what is beneficial for
each one, that He also supplies, as a physician to a sick man, as a father to his insubordinate
child: “For he that spareth his rod hateth his son.”215 And the Lord and His apostles walked
in the midst of fear and labours. When, then, the affliction is sent in the person of a righteous
man,216 it is either from the Lord rebuking him for a sin committed before, or guarding
him on account of the future, or not preventing by the exercise of His power an assault from
without,217—for some good end to him and to those near, for the sake of example.</p>
<p>X. Now those that dwell in a corrupt body, like those who sail in an old ship, do not lie
on their back, but are ever praying, stretching their hands to God.</p>
<p>XI. The ancients were exceedingly distressed, unless they had always some suffering in
the body. For they were afraid, that if they received not in this world the punishment of the
sins which, in numbers through ignorance, accompany those that are in the flesh, they would
in the other world suffer the penalty all at once. So that they preferred curative treatment
here. What is to be dreaded is, then, not external disease, but sins, for which disease comes,
and disease of the soul, not of the body: “For all flesh is grass,”218 and corporeal and external
good things are temporary; “but the things which are unseen are eternal.”219</p>
<p>XII. As to knowledge, some elements of it we already possess; others, by what we do
possess, we firmly hope to attain. For neither have we attained all, nor do we lack all. But
we have received, as it were, an earnest of the eternal blessings, and of the ancestral riches.
The provisions for the Lord’s way are the Lord’s beatitudes. For He said: “Seek,” and
anxiously seek, “the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you: for the

Father knoweth what things ye have need of.”220 Thus He limits not only our occupations,
but our cares. For He says: “Ye cannot, by taking thought, add aught to your stature.”221
For God knows well what it is good for us to have and what to want. He wishes, therefore,
that we, emptying ourselves of worldly cares, should be filled with that which is directed
towards God. “For we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with that which is incorruptible,
before putting off corruption.” For when faith is shed abroad, unbelief is nonplussed.
Similarly also with knowledge and righteousness. We must therefore not only empty the
soul, but fill it with God. For no longer is there evil in it, since that has been made to cease;
nor yet is there good, since it has not yet received good. But what is neither good nor evil
is nothing. “For to the swept and empty house return,”222 if none of the blessings of salvation
has been put in, the unclean spirit that dwelt there before, taking with him seven other unclean
spirits. Wherefore, after emptying the soul of what is evil, we must fill with the good
God that which is His chosen dwelling-place. For when the empty rooms are filled, then
follows the seal, that the sanctuary may be guarded for God.</p>
<p>XIII. “By two and three witnesses every word is established.”223 By Father, and Son,
and Holy Spirit, by whose witness and help the prescribed commandments ought to be
kept.224</p>
<p>XIV. Fasting, according to the signification of the word, is abstinence from food. Now
food makes us neither more righteous nor less. But mystically it shows that, as life is
maintained in individuals by sustenance, and want of sustenance is the token of death; so
also ought we to fast from worldly things, that we may die to the world, and after that, by
partaking of divine sustenance, live to God. Especially does fasting empty the soul of matter,
and make it, along with the body, pure and light for the divine words. Worldly food is, then,
the former life and sins; but the divine food is faith, hope, love, patience, knowledge, peace,
temperance. For “blessed are they that hunger and thirst after” God’s “righteousness; for
they shall be filled.”225 The soul, but not the body, it is which is susceptible of this craving.</p>
<p>XV. The Saviour showed to the believing apostles prayer to be stronger than faith in
the case of a demoniac, whom they could not cleanse, when He said, Such things are accomplished
by prayer. He who has believed has obtained forgiveness of sins from the Lord; but

he who has attained knowledge, inasmuch as he no longer sins, obtains from himself the
forgiveness of the rest.</p>
<p>XVI. For as cures, and prophecies, and signs are performed by the agency of men, God
working in them, so also is Gnostic teaching. For God shows His power through men. And
the prophecy rightly says, “I will send to them a man who will save them.”226 Accordingly
He sends forth at one time prophets, at another apostles, to be saviours of men. Thus God
does good by the agency of men. For it is not that God can do some things, and cannot do
others: He is never powerless in anything. No more are some things done with, and some
things against His will; and some things by Him, and some things by another. But He even
brought us into being by means of men, and trained us by means of men.</p>
<p>XVII. God made us, having previously no existence. For if we had a previous existence,
we must have known where we were, and how and why we came hither. But if we had no
pre-existence, then God is the sole author of our creation. As, then, He made us who had
no existence; so also, now that we are made, He saves us by His own grace, if we show
ourselves worthy and susceptible; if not, He227 will let us pass to our proper end. For He is
Lord both of the living and the dead.</p>
<p>XVIII. But see the power of God, not only in the case of men, in bringing to existence
out of non-existence, and making them when brought into being grow up according to the
progress of the time of life, but also in saving those who believe, in a way suitable to each
individual. And now He changes both hours, and times, and fruits, and elements. For this
is the one God, who has measured both the beginning and the end of events suitably to each
one.</p>
<p>XIX. Advancing from faith and fear to knowledge, man knows how to say Lord, Lord;
but not as His slave, he has learned to say, Our Father.228 Having set free the spirit of
bondage, which produces fear, and advanced by love to adoption, he now reverences from
love Him whom he feared before. For he no longer abstains from what he ought to abstain

from out of fear, but out of love clings to the commandments. “The Spirit itself,” it is said,
“beareth witness when we cry, Abba,229 Father.”230</p>
<p>XX. Now the Lord with His precious blood redeems us, freeing us from our old bitter
masters, that is, our sins, on account of which the spiritual powers of wickedness ruled over
us. Accordingly He leads us into the liberty of the Father,—sons that are co-heirs and
friends. “For,” says the Lord, “they that do the will of my Father are my brethren and fellowheirs.”
231 “Call no man, therefore, father to yourselves on earth.”232 For it is masters that
are on earth. But in heaven is the Father, of whom is the whole family, both in heaven and
on earth.233 For love rules willing hearts, but fear the unwilling. One kind of fear is base;
but the other, leading us as a pedagogue to good, brings us to Christ, and is saving.</p>
<p>XXI. Now if one has a conception of God, it by no means corresponds with His worthiness.
For what can the worthiness of God be? But let him, as far as is possible, conceive of
a great and incomprehensible and most beautiful light; inaccessible, comprehending all
good power, all comely virtue; caring for all, compassionate, passionless, good; knowing all
things, foreknowing all things, pure, sweet, shining, stainless.</p>
<p>XXII. Since the movement of the soul is self-originated, the grace of God demands from
it what the soul possesses, willingness as its contribution to salvation. For the soul wishes
to be its own good; which the Lord, however, gives it. For it is not devoid of sensation so as
to be carried along like a body. Having is the result of taking, and taking of willing and desiring;
and keeping hold of what one has received, of the exercise of care and of ability.
Wherefore God has endowed the soul with free choice, that He may show it its duty, and
that it choosing, may receive and retain.</p>
<p>XXIII. As through the body the Lord spake and healed, so also formerly by the prophets,
and now by the apostles and teachers. For the Church is the minister of the Lord’s power.
Thence He then assumed humanity,234 that by it He might minister to the Father’s will.
And at all times, the God who loves humanity235 invests Himself with man for the salvation
of men,—in former times with the prophets, and now with the Church. For it is fitting that
like should minister to like, in order to a like salvation.</p>

<p>XXIV. For we are of the earth.…Cæsar is the prince, for the time being, whose earthly
image is the old man, to which he has returned. To him, then, we are to render the earthly
things, which we bore in the image of the earthly, and the things of God to God. For each
one of the passions is on us as a letter, and stamp, and sign. Now the Lord marks us with
another stamp, and with other names and letters, faith instead of unbelief, and so forth.
Thus we are translated from what is material to what is spiritual, “having borne the image
of the heavenly.”236</p>
<p>XXV. John says: “I indeed baptize you with water, but there cometh after me He that
baptizeth with the Spirit and fire.”237 But He baptized no one with fire. But some, as Heraclius
says, marked with fire the ears of those who were sealed; understanding so the
apostolic saying, “For His fan is in His hand, to purge His floor: and He will gather the
wheat into the garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.”238 There is
joined, then, the expression “by fire” to that “by the Spirit;” since He separates the wheat
from the chaff, that is, from the material husk, by the Spirit; and the chaff is separated, being
fanned by the wind:239 so also the Spirit possesses a power of separating material forces.
Since, then, some things are produced from what is unproduced and indestructible,—that
is, the germs of life,—the wheat also is stored, and the material part, as long as it is conjoined
with the superior part, remains; when separated from it, it is destroyed; for it had its existence
in another thing. This separating element, then, is the Spirit, and the destroying element is
the fire: and material fire is to be understood. But since that which is saved is like wheat,
and that which grows in the soul like chaff, and the one is incorporeal, and that which is
separated is material; to the incorporeal He opposes spirit, which is rarefied and pure—almost
more so than mind; and to the material He opposes fire, not as being evil or bad, but as strong
and capable of cleansing away evil. For fire is conceived as a good force and powerful, destructive
of what is baser, and conservative of what is better. Wherefore this fire is by the
prophets called wise.</p>
<p>XXVI. Thus also, then, when God is called “a consuming fire,” it is because a name and
sign, not of wickedness, but of power, is to be selected. For as fire is the most potent of the
elements, and masters all things; so also God is all-powerful and almighty, who is able to
hold, to create, to make, to nourish, to make grow, to save, having power of body and soul.
As, then, fire is superior to the elements, so is the Almighty Ruler to gods, and powers, and
principalities. The power of fire is twofold: one power conduces to the production and
maturing of fruits and of animals, of which the sun is the image; and the other to consump-

tion and destruction, as terrestrial fire. When, then, God is called a consuming fire, He is
called a mighty and resistless power, to which nothing is impossible, but which is able to
destroy.</p>
<p>Respecting such a power, also, the Saviour says, “I came to send fire upon the earth,”240
indicating a power to purify what is holy, but destructive, as they say, of what is material;
and, as we should say, disciplinary. Now fear pertains to fire, and diffusion to light.</p>
<p>XXVII. Now the more ancient men241 did not write, as they neither wished to encroach
on the time devoted to attention bestowed on what they handed down, in the way of
teaching, by the additional attention bestowed on writing, nor spent the time for considering
what was to be said on writing. And, perhaps convinced that the function of composition
and the department of teaching did not belong to the same cast of mind, they gave way to
those who had a natural turn for it. For in the case of a speaker, the stream of speech flows
unchecked and impetuous, and you may catch it up hastily. But that which is always tested
by readers, meeting with strict242 examination, is thought worthy of the utmost pains, and
is, so to speak, the written confirmation of oral instruction, and of the voice so wafted along
to posterity by written composition. For that which was committed in trust to the elders,
speaking in writing, uses the writer’s help to hand itself down to those who are to read it.
As, then, the magnet, repelling other matter, attracts iron alone by reason of affinity; so also
books, though many read them, attract those alone who are capable of comprehending
them. For the word of truth is to some “foolishness,”243 and to others a “stumbling-block;”244
but to a few “wisdom.”245 So also is the power of God found to be. But far from the Gnostic
be envy. For it is for this reason also that he asks whether it be worse to give to the unworthy,
or not commit to the worthy; and runs the risk, from his abundant love of communicating,
not only to every one who is qualified, but sometimes also to one unworthy, who asks importunately;
not on account of his entreaty (for he loves not glory), but on account of the
persistency of the petitioner who bends his mind towards faith with copious entreaty.</p>
<p>XXVIII. There are those calling themselves Gnostics who are envious of those in their
own house more than strangers. And, as the sea is open to all, but one swims, another sails,
and a third catches fish; and as the land is common, but one walks, another ploughs, another
hunts,—somebody else searches the mines, and another builds a house: so also, when the

Scripture is read, one is helped to faith, another to morality, and a third is freed from superstition
by the knowledge of things. The athlete, who knows the Olympic stadium, strips for
training, contends, and becomes victor, tripping up his antagonists who contend against
his scientific method, and fighting out the contest. For scientific knowledge246 is necessary
both for the training of the soul and for gravity of conduct; making the faithful more active
and keen observers of things. For as there is no believing without elementary instruction,
so neither is there comprehension without science.247</p>
<p>XXIX. For what is useful and necessary to salvation, such as the knowledge of the Father,
and Son, and Holy Spirit, and also of our own soul, are wholly requisite; and it is at once
beneficial and necessary to attain to the scientific account of them. And to those who have
assumed the lead in doing good, much experience is advantageous; so that none of the things
which appear to be known necessarily and eruditely by others may escape their notice. The
exposition, too, of heterodox teaching affords another exercise of the inquiring soul, and
keeps the disciple from being seduced from the truth, by his having already had practice
beforehand in sounding all round on warlike instruments of music.248
XXX. The life of the Gnostic rule, (as they say that Crete was barren of deadly animals,)
is pure from every evil deed, and thought, and word; not only hating no one, but beyond
envy and hatred, and all evil-speaking and slander.</p>
<p>XXXI. In length of days, it is not on account of his having lived long that the man is to
be regarded happy, to whose lot it has also fallen, through his having lived, to be worthy of
living for ever. He has pained no one, except in instructing by the word the wounded in
heart, as it were by a salutary honey, which is at once sweet and pungent. So that, above all,
the Gnostic preserves the decorous along with that which is in accordance with reason. For
passion being cut away and stript off from the whole soul, he henceforth consorts and lives
with what is noblest, which has now become pure, and emancipated to adoption.</p>
<p>XXXII. Pythagoras thought that he who gave things their names, ought to be regarded
not only the most intelligent, but the oldest of the wise men. We must, then, search the
Scriptures accurately, since they are admitted to be expressed in parables, and from the
names hunt out the thoughts which the Holy Spirit, propounding respecting things, teaches
by imprinting His mind, so to speak, on the expressions; that the names used with various
meanings, being made the subject of accurate investigation, may be explained, and that that
which is hidden under many integuments may, being handled and learned, come to light
and gleam forth. For so also lead turns white as you rub it; white lead being produced from
black. So also scientific knowledge (gnosis), shedding its light and brightness on things,

shows itself to be in truth the divine wisdom, the pure light, which illumines the men whose
eyeball is clear, unto the sure vision and comprehension of truth.</p>
<p>XXXIII. Lighting, then, our torch249 at the source of that light, by the passionate desire
which has it for its object, and striving as much as possible to be assimilated to it, we become
men250 full of light,251 Israelites indeed. For He called those friends and brethren who by
desire and pursuit aimed after likeness to the Divinity.</p>
<p>XXXIV. Pure places and meadows have received voices and visions of holy phantasms.
252 But every man who has been perfectly purified, shall be thought worthy of divine
teaching and of power.</p>
<p>XXXV. Now I know that the mysteries of science (gnosis) are a laughing-stock to many,
especially when not patched up with sophistical figurative language. And the few are at first
startled at them; as when light is suddenly brought into a convivial party in the dark. Subsequently,
on getting used and accustomed, and trained to reasoning, as if gladdened and
exulting for delight, they praise the Lord.…For as pleasure has for its essence release from
pain; so also has knowledge the removal of ignorance. For as those that are most asleep
think they are most awake, being under the power of dream-visions very vivid and fixed;
so those that are most ignorant think that they know most. But blessed are they who rouse
themselves from this sleep and derangement, and raise their eyes to the light and the truth.</p>
<p>XXXVI. It is, therefore, equally requisite for him who wishes to have a pupil who is
docile, and has blended faith with aspiration, to exercise himself and constantly to study by
himself, investigating the truth of his speculations; and when he thinks himself right, to
descend to questions regarding things contiguous. For the young birds make attempts to
fly in the nest, exercising their wings.</p>
<p>XXXVII. For Gnostic virtue everywhere makes man good, and meek, and harmless,253
and painless, and blessed, and ready to associate in the best way with all that is divine, in
the best way with men, at once a contemplative and active divine image, and turns him into
a lover of what is good by love. For what is good,254 as there it is contemplated and comprehended
by wisdom, is here by self-control and righteousness carried into effect through
faith: practising in the flesh an angelic ministry; hallowing the soul in the body, as in a place
clear and stainless.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. Against Tatian,255 who says that the words, “Let there be light,”256 are supplicatory.
If, then, He is supplicating the supreme God, how does He say, “I am God, and
beside me there is none else?”257 We have said that there are punishments for blasphemies,
for nonsense, for outrageous expressions; which are punished and chastised by reason.</p>
<p>XXXIX. And he said, too, that on account of their hair and finery, women are punished
by the Power that is set over these matters; which also gave to Samson strength in his hair;
which punishes the women who allure to fornication through the adornment of their hair.</p>
<p>XL. As by the effluence of good, people are made good; in like manner are they made
bad. Good is the judgment of God, and the discrimination of the believing from the unbelieving,
and the judgment beforehand, so as not to fall into greater judgment—this judgment
being correction.</p>
<p>XLI. Scripture says that infants which are exposed are delivered to a guardian angel,
and that by him they are trained and reared. “And they shall be,” it says, “as the faithful in
this world of a hundred years of age.” Wherefore also Peter, in the Revelation,258 says:
“And a flash of fire, leaping from those infants, and striking the eyes of the women.” For
the just shines: forth as a spark in a reed, and will judge the nations.259</p>
<p>XLII. “With the holy Thou wilt be holy.”260 “According to thy praise is thy name
glorified;” God being glorified through our knowledge, and through the inheritance. Thus
also it is said, “The Lord liveth,” and “The Lord hath risen.”261</p>
<p>XLIII. “A people whom I knew not hath served me;”262—by covenant I knew them
not, alien sons, who desired what pertained to another.</p>
<p>XLIV. “Magnifying the salvations of His king.”263 All the faithful are called kings,
brought to royalty through inheritance.</p>
<p>XLV. Long-suffering is sweetness above honey; not because it is long-suffering, but in
consequence of the fruit of long-suffering. Since, then, the man of self-control is devoid of
passion, inasmuch as he restrains the passions, not without toil; but when habit is formed,
he is no longer a man of self-control, the man having come under the influence of one habit
and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>XLVI. The passions that are in the soul are called spirits,—not spirits of power, since
in that case the man under the influence of passion would be a legion of demons; but they
are so called in consequence of the impulse they communicate. For the soul itself, through
modifications, taking on this and that other sort of qualities of wickedness, is said to receive
spirits.</p>
<p>XLVII. The Word does not bid us renounce property;264 but to manage property
without inordinate affection; and on anything happening, not to be vexed or grieved; and
not to desire to acquire. Divine Providence bids keep away from possession accompanied
with passion, and from all inordinate affection, and from this turns back those still remaining265
in the flesh.</p>
<p>XLVIII. For instance, Peter says in the Apocalypse,266 that abortive infants shall share
the better fate;267 that these are committed to a guardian angel, so that, on receiving
knowledge, they may obtain the better abode, having had the same experiences which they
would have had had they been in the body. But the others shall obtain salvation merely, as
being injured and pitied, and remain without punishment, receiving this reward.</p>
<p>XLIX. The milk of women, flowing from the breasts and thickening, says Peter in the
Apocalypse,268 will produce minute beasts, that prey on flesh, and running back into them
will consume them: teaching that punishments arise for sins. He says that they are produced
from sins; as it was for their sins that the people were sold. And for their want of faith in
Christ, as the apostle says, they were bitten by serpents.</p>
<p>L. An ancient said that the embryo is a living thing; for that the soul entering into the
womb after it has been by cleansing prepared for conception, and introduced by one of the
angels who preside over generation, and who knows the time for conception, moves the
woman to intercourse; and that, on the seed being deposited, the spirit, which is in the seed,
is, so to speak, appropriated, and is thus assumed into conjunction in the process of formation.
He cited as a proof to all, how, when the angels give glad tidings to the barren, they
introduce souls before conception. And in the Gospel “the babe leapt”269 as a living thing.
And the barren are barren for this reason, that the soul, which unites for the deposit of the
seed, is not introduced so as to secure conception and generation.</p>

<p>LI. “The heavens declare the glory of God.”270 The heavens are taken in various
meanings, both those defined by space and revolution, and those by covenant,—the immediate
operation of the first-created angels. For the covenants caused a more especial appearance
of angels,—that271 in the case of Adam, that in the case of Noah, that in the case of
Abraham, that in the case of Moses. For, moved by the Lord, the first-created angels exercised
their influence on the angels attached to the prophets, considering the covenants the glory
of God. Furthermore, the things done on earth by angels were done by the first-created
angels to the glory of God.</p>
<p>LII. It is the Lord that is principally denominated the Heavens, and then the First-created;
and after these also the holy men before the Law, as the patriarchs, and Moses, and
the prophets; then also the apostles. “And the firmament showeth His handiwork.” He
applies the term “firmament”272 to God, the passionless and immoveable, as also elsewhere
the same David says, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength273 and my refuge.”274 Accordingly,
the firmament itself shows forth the work of His hands,—that is, shows and manifests
the work of His angels. For He shows forth and manifests those whom He hath made.</p>
<p>LIII. “Day unto day uttereth speech.” As the heavens have various meanings, so also
has day. Now speech is the Lord; and He is also frequently called day. “And night unto
night showeth forth knowledge.” The devil knew that the Lord was to come. But he did
not believe that He was God; wherefore also he tempted Him, in order to know if He were
powerful. It is said, “he left275 Him, and departed from Him for a season;” that is, he postponed
the discovery till the resurrection. For he knew that He who was to rise was the Lord.
Likewise also the demons; since also they suspected that Solomon was the Lord, and they
knew that he was not so, on his sinning. “Night to night.” All the demons knew that He
who rose after the passion was the Lord. And already Enoch276 had said, that the angels
who transgressed taught men astronomy and divination, and the rest of the arts.</p>
<p>LIV. “There are no speeches or words whose voices are not heard,” neither of days nor
nights. “Their sound is gone forth unto all the earth.” He has transferred the discourse to
the saints alone, whom he calls both heavens and days.</p>
<p>LV. The stars, spiritual bodies, that have communications with the angels set over them,
and are governed by them, are not the cause of the production of things, but are signs of

what is taking place, and will take place, and have taken place in the case of atmospheric
changes, of fruitfulness and barrenness, of pestilence and fevers, and in the case of men.
The stars do not in the least degree exert influences, but indicate what is, and will be, and
has been.</p>
<p>LVI. “And in the sun hath He set His tabernacle.” There is a transposition here. For
it is of the second coming that the discourse is. So, then, we must read what is transposed
in its due sequence: “And he, as a bridegroom issuing from his chamber, will rejoice as a
giant to run his way. From heaven’s end is his going forth; and there is no one who shall
hide himself from his heat;” and then, “He hath set His tabernacle in the sun.”</p>
<p>Some say that He deposited the Lord’s body in the sun, as Hermogenes. And “His tabernacle,”
some say, is His body, others the Church of the faithful.</p>
<p>Our Pantænus277 used to say, that prophecy utters its expressions indefinitely for the
most part, and uses the present for the future, and again the present for the past. Which is
also seen here.278 For “He hath set” is put both for the past and the future. For the future,
because, on the completion of this period, which is to run according to its present279 constitution,
the Lord will come to restore the righteous, the faithful, in whom He rests, as in a
tent, to one and the same unity; for all are one body, of the same race, and have chosen the
same faith and righteousness. But some as head, some as eyes, some as ears, some as hands,
some as breasts, some as feet, shall be set, resplendent, in the sun. “Shine forth as the sun,”280
or in the sun; since an angel high in command is in the sun. For he is appointed for rule
over days; as the moon is for ruling over night.281 Now angels are called days. Along with
the angels in282 the sun, it is said, they shall have assigned to them one abode, to be for some
time and in some respects the sun, as it were the head of the body which is one. And, besides,
they also are the rulers of the days, as that angel in the sun, for the greater purpose for which
he before them283 migrated to the same place. And again destined to ascend progressively,
they reach the first abode, in accordance with the past “He hath set:” so that the first-created
angels shall no longer, according to providence, exercise a definite ministry, but may be in
repose, and devoted to the contemplation of God alone; while those next to them shall be
promoted to the post which they have left; and so those beneath them similarly.</p>

<p>LVII. There are then, according to the apostle, those on the summit,284 the first-created.
And they are thrones, although Powers, being the first-created, inasmuch as God rests in
them, as also in those who believe. For each one, according to his own stage of advancement
possesses the knowledge of God in a way special to himself; and in this knowledge God reposes,
those who possess knowledge being made immortal by knowledge. And is not “He
set His tabernacle in the sun” to be understood thus? God “set in the sun,” that is, in the
God who is beside Him, as in the Gospel, Eli, Eli,285 instead of my God, my God. And what
is “above all rule, and authority, and power, and every name that is named,” are those from
among men that are made perfect as angels and archangels, so as to rise to the nature of the
angels first-created. For those who are changed from men to angels are instructed for a
thousand years by the angels after they are brought to perfection. Then those who have
taught are translated to archangelic authority; and those who have learned instruct those
again who from men are changed to angels. Thus afterwards, in the prescribed periods,
they are brought to the proper angelic state of the body.</p>
<p>LVIII. “The law of God is perfect, converting souls.”286 The Saviour Himself is called
Law and Word, as Peter in “the Preaching,” and the prophet: “Out of Zion shall go forth
the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”287</p>
<p>LIX. “The testimony of the Lord is sure, making children wise.” The covenant of the
Lord is true, making wise children; those free from evil, both the apostles, and then also us.
Besides, the testimony of the Lord, according to which He rose again after His passion,
having been verified by fact, led the Church to confirmation in faith.</p>
<p>LX. “The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever.” He says that those who have been
turned from fear to faith and righteousness endure for ever.</p>
<p>“The judgments of the Lord are true,”—sure, and incapable of being overturned; and
giving rewards according to what is right, bringing the righteous to the unity of the faith.
For this is shown in the words, “justified for the same.”288 “Such desires289 are above gold
and precious stone.”</p>
<p>LXI. “For also Thy servant keeps them.” Not that David alone is called servant; but the
whole people saved is called the servant of God, in virtue of obedience to the command.</p>

<head>TWO EPISTLES CONCERNING VIRGINITY.</head>
<p>ATTRIBUTED TO CLEMENT OF ROME.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Two Epistles Concerning Virginity.</head>
<p>By Professor M. B. Riddle, D.D.</p>
<p>Among the “Pseudo-Clementina” the Two Epistles concerning Virginity must properly
be placed. The evidence against the genuineness seems conclusive; yet, with the exception
of the homily usually styled the Second Epistle of Clement,290 no spurious writings attributed
to the great Roman Father can be assigned an earlier date than these two letters. Uhlhorn,
in view of the reference to the sub-introductæ, thinks they were written shortly before the
time of Cyprian;291 and this seems very probable. Jerome was acquainted with the writings
(Ad Jovinum, i. 12), and possibly Epiphanius (Hær., xxx. 15). Hence we may safely allow
an early date. Yet these evidences of age tell against the genuineness.</p>
<p>1. Early works of this character would not have disappeared from notice to such an
extent, had they been authenticated as writings of Clement. Supporting, as they do, the ascetic
tendency prevalent in the Western Church at and after the date when they are first
noticed by Christian writers, they would have been carefully preserved and frequently cited,
had they been genuine. The name of the great Roman Father would have been so weighty,
that the advocates of celibacy would have kept the documents in greater prominence. The
silence of Eusebius respecting the letters is an important fact in this discussion.</p>
<p>2. A second argument against the genuineness is derived from the ascetic tone itself.
Such pronounced statements are not, we must firmly hold, to be found in the Christian literature
of the sub-apostolic age. This historical argument is further sustained by other indications
in the epistles. They point to a stage of ecclesiastical development which belongs
to a much later period than that of Clement.</p>
<p>3. The use of Scripture in these letters seems to be conclusive against the Clementine
authorship. A comparison with the citations in the genuine Epistle of Clement shows that
these writings make much greater use of the Pauline (particularly the Pastoral) Epistles; that
the Old Testament is less frequently cited, and that the mode of handling proof-texts is that
of a later age.</p>
<note type="footnote">290 See vol. vii. pp. 509–523.</note>
<note type="footnote">291 Against this class Cyprian stoutly contended. Comp. Cyprian, Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. v. pp. 357, 358,
587–592.</note>

<pb n="93"/>
<p>4. The judgment of the most candid patristic scholars is against the genuineness. Of
Protestants, Wetstein stands alone in supporting the Clementine authorship; and his position
is readily explained by the fact that he discovered the Syriac version which restored the
writings to modern scholars (see below). The genuineness is defended by Villecourt and
Beelen (see below), also by Möhler, Champagny, and Brück. But such experts as Mansi,
Hefele, Alzog, and Funk, among Roman Catholics, unite with Protestant scholars in assigning
a later date, and consequently in denying the Clementine authorship.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="other">
<head>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</head>
<p>While the great mass of early Christian literature bearing the name of Clement of Rome
is undoubtedly spurious, the case is somewhat different with regard to the two following
epistles. Not only have Roman Catholic writers maintained their genuineness with great
ingenuity and learning, but Wetstein, who first edited them, argued powerfully for their
being received as the authentic productions of Clement; and even Neander has admitted
that they may possibly have been written by that friend and fellow-labourer of the apostles.</p>
<p>Their literary history in modern times is somewhat curious. Wetstein unexpectedly
discovered them appended to a copy of the Syriac Peschito version of the New Testament
furnished to him by Sir James Porter, then British ambassador at Constantinople. He soon
afterwards (1752) published them in Syriac, accompanied by a Latin version of his own,
with Prolegomena, in which he upheld their genuineness. This speedily called forth two
works, one by Lardner (1753), and a second by Venema (1754), in both of which their authenticity
was disputed. To these writings Wetstein himself, and, after his death, Gallandius,
published rejoinders; but the question remained as far from positive settlement as ever, and
continues sub-judice even at the present day</p>
<p>It is generally admitted (and, of course, asserted by those that maintain their truly
Clementine origin) that Greek was the original language of these epistles. Many have argued
that they contain plain references to the sub-introductæ spoken of in the literature of the
third century, and that therefore they were probably composed in the Oriental Church about
that period.</p>
<p>These epistles have been very carefully edited in recent times by the Roman Catholic
scholars Villecourt (1853) and Beelen (1856). Both have argued strenuously for the genuineness
of the letters, but it may be doubted if they have succeeded in repelling all the objections
of Lardner and Venema. Beelen’s work is a highly scholarly production, and his Prolegomena
are marked by great fulness and perspicuity.</p>
<p>A German translation of these epistles was published by Zingerle (1821). They are now
for the first time translated into the English language.</p>
<p>The translation is made from the text of Beelen.</p>
<p>The division into chapters is due to Wetstein.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—For True Virginity Perfect Virtue is Necessary.</head>
<p>Of all virgins of either sex who have truly resolved to preserve virginity for the sake of
the kingdom of heaven—of each and every one of them it is required that he be worthy of
the kingdom of heaven in every thing. For not by eloquence295 or renown,296 by station297
and descent, or by beauty or strength, or by length of life,298 is the kingdom of heaven obtained;
but it is obtained by the power of faith, when a man exhibits the works of faith. For
whosoever is truly righteous, his works testify concerning his faith, that he is truly a believer,
with a faith which is great, a faith which is perfect, a faith which is in God, a faith which
shines in good works, that the Father of all may be glorified through Christ. Now, those
who are truly virgins for the sake of God give heed to Him who hath said, “Let not righteousness
and faith fail thee; bind them on thy neck, and thou shalt find favour for thyself; and
devise thou good things before God and before men.”299 “The paths,” therefore, “of the
righteous shine as the light, and the light of them advances until the day is perfect.”300 For
the beams of their light illumine the whole creation even now by good works, as those who
are truly “the light of the world,”301 giving light to “those who sit in darkness,”302 that they
may arise and go forth from the darkness by the light of the good works of the fear of God,
“that they may see our good works and glorify our Father who is in heaven.”303 For it is
required of the man of God, that in all his words and works he be perfect, and that in his
life he be adorned with all exemplary and well-ordered behaviour,304 and do all his deeds
in righteousness, as a man of God.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—True Virgins Prove Themselves Such by Self-Denial, as Does the True
Believer by Good Works.</head>
<p>For virgins are a beautiful pattern to believers, and to those who shall believe. The name
alone, indeed, without works, does not introduce into the kingdom of heaven; but, if a man
be truly a believer, such an one can be saved. For, if a person be only called a believer in
name, whilst he is not such in works, he cannot possibly be a believer. “Let no one,” therefore,
“lead you astray with the empty words of error.”305 For, merely because a person is called
a virgin, if he be destitute of works excellent and comely, and suitable to virginity, he cannot
possibly be saved. For our Lord called such virginity as that “foolish,” as He said in the
Gospel;306 and because it had neither oil nor light, it was left outside of the kingdom of
heaven, and was shut out from the joy of the bridegroom, and was reckoned with His enemies.
For such persons as these “have the appearance only of the fear of God, but the power
of it they deny.”307 For they “think with themselves that they are something, whilst they
are nothing, and are deceived. But let every one constantly try308 his works,”309 and know

by all good works. For “every tree whatsoever is known from its fruits.”310 “See that thou

before God to preserve sanctity must be girded with all the holy power of God. And, if with

<p>Thou desirest, then, to be a virgin? Knowest thou what hardship and irksomeness there
is in true virginity—that which stands constantly at all seasons before God, and does not
withdraw from His service, and “is anxious how it may please its Lord with a holy body, and
with its spirit?”324 Knowest thou what great glory pertains to virginity, and is it for this that
thou dost set thyself to practise it? Dost thou really know and understand what it is thou
art eager to do? Art thou acquainted with the noble task of holy virginity? Dost thou know
how, like a man, to enter “lawfully” upon325 this contest and “strive,”326 that, in the might
of the Holy Spirit,327 thou choosest this for thyself, that thou mayest be crowned with a
crown of light, and that they may lead thee about in triumph through “the Jerusalem
above”?328 If so be, then, that thou longest for all these things, conquer the body; conquer
the appetites of the flesh; conquer the world in the Spirit of God; conquer these vain things
of time, which pass away and grow old, and decay, and come to an end; conquer the
dragon;329 conquer the lion;330 conquer the serpent;331 conquer Satan;—through Jesus
Christ, who doth strengthen thee by the hearing of His words and the divine Eucharist.332
“Take up thy cross and follow”333 Him who makes thee clean, Jesus Christ thy Lord. Strive
to run straight forward and boldly, not with fear, but with courage, relying on the promise
of thy Lord, that thou shalt obtain the victor-crown334 of thy “calling on high”335 through
Jesus Christ. For whosoever walks perfect in faith, and not fearing, doth in very deed receive
the crown of virginity, which is great in its toil and great in its reward. Dost thou understand
and know how honourable a thing is sanctity?336 Dost thou understand how great and exalted
and excellent is the glory of virginity?337</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Divinity of Virginity.</head>
<p>The womb of a holy virgin338 carried our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and the
body which our Lord wore, and in which He carried on the conflict in this world, He put
on from a holy virgin. From this, therefore, understand the greatness and dignity of virginity.
Dost thou wish to be a Christian? Imitate Christ in everything. John, the ambassador, he
who came before our Lord, he “than whom there was not a greater among those born of
women,”339 the holy messenger of our Lord, was a virgin. Imitate, therefore, the ambassador
of our Lord, and be his follower340 in every thing. That John, again, who “reclined on the
bosom of our Lord, and whom He greatly loved,”341—he, too, was a holy person.342 For it
was not without reason that our Lord loved him. Paul, also, and Barnabas, and Timothy,
with all the others, “whose names are written in the book of life,”343—these, I say, all cherished
and loved sanctity,344 and ran in the contest, and finished their course without
blemish, as imitators of Christ, and as sons of the living God. Moreover, also, Elijah and
Elisha, and many other holy men, we find to have lived a holy345 and spotless life. If,
therefore, thou desirest to be like these, imitate them with all thy power. For the Scripture
has said, “The elders who are among you, honour; and, seeing their manner of life and
conduct, imitate their faith.”346 And again it saith, “Imitate me, my brethren, as I imitate
Christ.”347</p>

<p>Those, therefore, who imitate Christ, imitate Him earnestly. For those who have “put
on Christ”348 in truth, express His likeness in their thoughts, and in their whole life, and in
all their behaviour: in word, and in deeds, and in patience, and in fortitude, and in knowledge,
and in chastity, and in long-suffering, and in a pure heart, and in faith, and in hope,
and in full and perfect love towards God. No virgin, therefore, unless they be in everything
as Christ, and as those “who are Christs,”349 can be saved. For every virgin who is in God
is holy in her body and in her spirit, and is constant in the service of her Lord, not turning
away from it any whither, but waiting upon Him always in purity and holiness in the Spirit
of God, being “solicitous how she may please her Lord,”350 by living purely and without
stain, and solicitous to be pleasing before Him in every thing. She who is such does not
withdraw from our Lord, but in spirit is ever with her Lord: as it is written, “Be ye holy, as
I am holy, saith the Lord.”351</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Continuation of the Subject of Mortification; Dignity of Persons
Consecrated to God.</head>
<p>He in whomsoever the Spirit of God is, is in accord with the will of the Spirit of God;
and, because he is in accord with the Spirit of God, therefore does he mortify the deeds of
the body and live unto God, “treading down and subjugating the body and keeping it under;
so that, while preaching to others,” he may be a beautiful example and pattern to believers,
and may spend his life in works which are worthy of the Holy Spirit, so that he may “not be
cast away,”372 but may be approved before God and before men. For in “the man who is
of God,”373 with him I say there is nothing of the mind of the flesh; and especially in virgins
of either sex; but the fruits of all of them are “the fruits of the Spirit”374 and of life, and they
are truly the city of God, and the houses and temples in which God abides and dwells, and
among which He walks, as in the holy city of heaven. For in this “do ye appear to the world
as lights, in that ye give heed to the Word of life,”375 and thus ye are in truth the praise, and
the boast, and the crown of rejoicing, and the delight of good servants in our Lord Jesus
Christ. For all who see you will “acknowledge that ye are the seed which the Lord hath
blessed;”376 in very deed a seed honourable and holy, and “a priestly kingdom, a holy people,
the people of the inheritance,”377 the heirs of the promises of God; of things which do not
decay, nor wither; of “that which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which hath

<p>Now, we are persuaded of you, my brethren, that your thoughts are occupied about

of the evil rumours and reports concerning shameless men, who, under pretext of the fear
of God, have their dwelling with maidens, and so, expose themselves to danger, and walk
with them along the road and in solitary places381 alone—a course which is full of dangers,
and full of stumbling-blocks and snares and pitfalls; nor is it in any respect right for Christians
and those who fear God so to conduct themselves. Others, too, eat and drink with
them at entertainments allowing themselves in loose behaviour and much uncleanness—such
as ought not to be among believers, and especially among those who have chosen for
themselves a life of holiness.382 Others, again, meet together for vain and trifling conversation
and merriment, and that they may speak evil of one another; and they hunt up tales against
one another, and are idle: persons with whom we do not allow you even to eat bread. Then,
others gad about among the houses of virgin brethren or sisters, on pretence of visiting
them, or reading the Scriptures to them, or exorcising them. Forasmuch as they are idle
and do no work, they pry into those things which ought not to be inquired into, and by
means of plausible words make merchandise of the name of Christ. These are men from

<p>Such are the ways of all those who do not work, but go hunting for tales, and think to
themselves that this is profitable and right.385 For such persons are like those idle and
prating widows “who go wandering about386 among houses”387 with their prating, and hunt
for idle tales, and carry them from house to house with much exaggeration, without fear of
God. And besides all this, barefaced men as they are,388 under pretence of teaching, they
set forth a variety of doctrines. And would that they taught the doctrines of truth! But it is
this which is so disquieting, that they understand not what they mean, and assert that which
is not true: because they wish to be teachers, and to display themselves as skilful in speaking;
because they traffic in iniquity in the name of Christ—which it is not right for the servants
of God to do. And they hearken not to that which the Scripture has said: “Let not many be
teachers among you, my brethren, and be not all of you prophets.”389 For “he who does
not transgress in word is a perfect man, able to keep down and subjugate his whole body.”390
And, “If a man speak, let him speak in the words391 of God.”392 And, “If there is in thee
understanding, give an answer to thy brother but if not, put thy hand on thy mouth.”393
For, “at one time it is proper to keep silence, and at another thee to speak.”394 And again it
says “When a man speaks in season, it is honourable395 to him.”396 And again it says: “Let
your speech be seasoned with grace. For it is required of a man to know how to give an
answer to every one in season.”397 For “he that utters whatsoever comes to his mouth, that
man produces strife; and he that utters a superfluity of words increases vexation; and he
that is hasty with his lips falls into evil. For because of the unruliness of the tongue cometh
anger; but the perfect man keeps watch over his tongue, and loves his soul’s life.”398 For

these are they “who by good words and fair speeches lead astray the hearts of the simple,
and, while offering them blessings, lead them astray.”399 Let us, therefore, fear the judgment
which awaits teachers. For a severe judgment will those teachers receive “who teach, but
do not,”400 and those who take upon them the name of Christ falsely, and say: We teach
the truth, and yet go wandering about idly, and exalt themselves, and make their boast” in
the mind of the flesh.”401 These, moreover, are like “the blind man who leads the blind
man, and they both fall into the ditch.”402 And they will receive judgment, because in their
talkativeness and their frivolous teaching they teach natural403 wisdom and the “frivolous
error of the plausible words of the wisdom of men,”404 “according to the will of the prince
of the dominion of the air, and of the spirit which works in those men who will not obey,
according to the training of this world, and not according to the doctrine of Christ.”405 But
if thou hast received “the word of knowledge, or the word of instruction, or of prophecy,”406
blessed be God, “who helps every man without grudging—that God who gives to every man
and does not upbraid him.”407 With the gift, therefore, which thou hast received from our
Lord, serve thy spiritual brethren, the prophets who know that the words which thou
speakest are those of our Lord; and declare the gift which thou hast received in the Church
for the edification of the brethren in Christ (for good and excellent are those things which
help the men of God), if so be that they are truly with thee.408</p>

<p>Moreover, also, this is comely and useful, that a man “visit orphans and widows,”409
and especially those poor persons who have many children. These things are, without
controversy, required of the servants of God, and comely and suitable for them. This also,
again, is suitable and right and comely for those who are brethren in Christ, that they should
visit those who are harassed by evil spirits, and pray and pronounce adjurations410 over
them, intelligently, offering such prayer as is acceptable before God; not with a multitude
of fine words,411 well prepared and arranged, so that they may appear to men eloquent and
of a good memory. Such men are “like a sounding pipe, or a tinkling cymbal;”412 and they
bring no help to those over whom they make their adjurations; but they speak with terrible
words, and affright people, but do not act with true faith, according to the teaching of our
Lord, who hath said: “This kind goeth not out but by fasting and prayer,”413 offered unceasingly
and with earnest mind. And let them holily ask and beg of God, with cheerfulness
and all circumspection and purity, without hatred and without malice. In this way let us
approach a brother or a sister who is sick, and visit them in a way that is right, without guile,
and without covetousness, and without noise, and without talkativeness, and without such
behaviour as is alien from the fear of God, and without haughtiness, but with the meek and
lowly spirit of Christ. Let them, therefore, with fasting and with prayer make their adjurations,
and not with the elegant and well-arranged and fitly-ordered words of learning, but
as men who have received the gift of healing from God, confidently, to the glory of God.
By414 your fastings and prayers and perpetual watching, together with your other good
works, mortify the works of the flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit. He who acts thus “is

him. For it is good that a man help those that are sick. Our Lord hath said: “Cast out
demons,” at the same time commanding many other acts of healing; and, “Freely ye have
received, freely give.”416 For such persons as these a goodly recompense is laid up by God,
because they serve their brethren with the gifts which have been given them by the Lord.

This is also comely and helpful to the servants of God, because they act according to the
injunctions of our Lord, who hath said: “I was sick, and ye visited Me, and so on.”417 And
this is comely and right and just, that we visit our neighbours for the sake of God with all
seemliness of manner and purity of behaviour; as the Apostle hath said: “Who is sick, and
I am not sick? who is offended, and I am not offended?”418 But all these things are spoken
in reference to the love with which a man should love his neighbour. And in these things
let us occupy ourselves,419 without giving offence, and let us not do anything with partiality
or for the shaming of others, but let us love the poor as the servants of God, and especially
let us visit them. For this is comely before God and before men, that we should remember
the poor, and be lovers of the brethren and of strangers, for the sake of God and for the sake
of those who believe in God, as we have learnt from the law and from the prophets, and
from our Lord Jesus Christ, concerning the love of the brotherhood and the love of strangers:

the love of strangers;420 powerfully are the words spoken to all those who do them.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—What Priests Should Be and Should Not Be.</head>
<p>Beloved brethren! that a man should build up and establish the brethren on the faith in
one God, this also is manifest and well-known. This too, again, is comely, that a man should
not be envious of his neighbour. And moreover, again, it is suitable and comely that all
those who work the works of the Lord should work the works of the Lord in the fear of God.
Thus is it required of them to conduct themselves. That “the harvest is great, but the
workmen are few,” this also is well-known and manifest. Let us, therefore, “ask of the Lord
of the harvest” that He would send forth workmen into the harvest;421 such workmen as
“shall skilfully dispense the word of truth;” workmen “who shall not be ashamed;”422 faithful
workmen; workmen who shall be “the light of the world;”423 workmen who “work not for
the food that perisheth, but for that food which abideth unto life eternal;”424 workmen who
shall be such as the apostles; workmen who imitate the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Spirit; who are concerned for the salvation of men; not “hireling”425 workmen; not workmen
to whom the fear of God and righteousness appear to be gain; not workmen who “serve
their belly;” not workmen who “with fair speeches and pleasant words mislead the hearts
of the innocent;”426 not workmen who imitate the children of light, while they are not light
but darkness—“men whose end is destruction;”427 not workmen who practise iniquity and
wickedness and fraud; not “crafty workmen;”428 not workmen “drunken” and “faithless;”429
nor workmen who traffic in Christ;430 not misleaders; not “lovers of money; not malevolent.”
431</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, contemplate and imitate the faithful who have conducted themselves
well in the Lord, as is becoming and suitable to our calling and profession. Thus let us do
service before God in justice and righteousness, and without blemish, “occupying ourselves

<head>Chapter I.—He Describes the Circumspectness of His Intercourse with the Other
Sex, and Tells How in His Journeys He Acts at Places Where There are Brethren

<p>I would, moreover, have you know, my brethren, of what sort is our conduct in Christ,
as well as that of all our brethren, in the various places in which we are. And if so be that
you approve it, do ye also conduct yourselves in like manner in the Lord. Now we, if God
help us, conduct ourselves thus: with maidens we do not dwell, nor have we anything in
common with them; with maidens we do not eat, nor drink; and, where a maiden sleeps,
we do not sleep; neither do women wash our feet, nor anoint us; and on no account do we
sleep where a maiden sleeps who is unmarried or has taken the vow:433 even though she
be in some other place if she be alone, we do not pass the night there.434 Moreover, if it
chance that the time for rest overtake us in a place, whether in the country, or in a village,
or in a town, or in a hamlet,435 or wheresoever we happen to be, and there are found brethren
in that place, we turn in to one who is a brother, and call together there all the brethren, and
speak to them words of encouragement and exhortation.436 And those among us who are
gifted in speaking will speak such words as are earnest, and serious, and chaste, in the fear
of God, and exhort them to please God in everything, and abound and go forward in good
works, and “be free from437 anxious care in everything,”438 as is fit and right for the people

<p>And if, moreover, it chance that we are distant from our homes and from our neighbours,
and the day decline and the eventide overtake us, and the brethren press us, through love
of the brotherhood and by reason of their affection for strangers, to stay with them, so that
we may watch with them, and they may hear the holy word of God and do it, and be fed
with the words of the Lord, so that they may be mindful of them, and they set before us
bread and water and that which God provides, and we be willing and consent to stay through
the night with them; if there be there a holy man,439 with him we turn in and lodge, and
that same brother will provide and prepare whatever is necessary for us; and he himself
waits upon us, and he himself washes our feet for us and anoints us with ointment, and he
himself gets ready a bed for us, that we may sleep in reliance on God. All these things will
that consecrated brother, who is in the place in which we tarry, do in his own person. He
will himself serve the brethren, and each one of the brethren who are in the same place will
join with him in rendering all those services440 which are requisite for the brethren. But
with us may no female, whether young maiden or married woman, be there at that time;441
nor she that is aged,442 nor she that has taken the vow; not even a maid-servant, whether
Christian or heathen; but there shall only be men with men. And, if we see it to be requisite
to stand and pray for the sake of the women, and to speak words of exhortation and edification,
we call together the brethren and all the holy sisters and maidens, and likewise all the
other women who are there, inviting them with all modesty and becoming behaviour to
come and feast on the truth.443 And those among us who are skilled in speaking speak to
them, and exhort them in those words which God has given us. And then we pray, and salute444
one another, the men the men. But the women and the maidens will wrap their
hands in their garments; and we also, with circumspection and with all purity, our eyes
looking upwards, shall wrap our right hand in our garments; and then they will come and
give us the salutation on our right hand wrapped in our garments. Then we go where God
permits us.</p>

minister to him, and care for his wants445 in everything, assiduously, with good-will. And
the brother shall be ministered to by them in the way that is suitable. And the brother will
say to the married persons who are in that place: We holy men do not eat or drink with
women, nor are we waited on by women or by maidens, nor do women wash our feet for
us, nor do women anoint us, nor do women prepare our bed for us, nor do we sleep where
women sleep, so that we may be without reproach in everything, lest any one should be offended
or stumble at us. And, whilst we observe all these things, “we are without offence

<p>But if we chance to come into a place where there are no Christian men, but all the believers

we call them all together to some suitable place,449 and ask them how they do; and according
to that which we learn from them, and what we see to be their state of mind, we address
them in a suitable manner, as men fearing God. And when they have all assembled and
come together, and we see that they are in peace,450 we address to them words of exhortation
in the fear of God, and read the Scripture to them, with purity and in the concise451 and
weighty words of the fear of God. We do everything as for their edification. And as to those
who are married, we speak to them in the Lord in a manner suited to them. And if, moreover,
the day decline and the eventide draw on, we select, in order to pass the night there, a woman
who is aged and the most exemplary452 of them all; and we speak to her to give us a place
all to ourselves, where no woman enters, nor maiden. And this old woman herself will bring
us a lamp, and whatever is requisite for us she will herself bring us. From love to the brethren,
she will bring whatever is requisite for the service of stranger brethren. And she herself,
when the time for sleep is come, will depart and go to her house in peace.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Where There is Only One Woman, the Father Does Not Make a Stay;
How Carefully Stumbling-Blocks Must Be Avoided.</head>
<p>But if, moreover, we chance upon a place, and find there one believing woman only,
and no other person be there but she only, we do not stop there, nor pray there, nor read
the Scriptures there, but we flee as from before the face of a serpent, and as from before the
face of sin. Not that we disdain the believing woman—far be it from us to be so minded
towards our brethren in Christ!—but, because she is alone, we are afraid lest any one should
make insinuations against us in words of falsehood. For the hearts of men are firmly set453
on evil. And, that we may not give a pretext to those who desire to get a pretext against us
and to speak evil of us, and that we may not be a stumbling-block to any one, on this account
we cut off the pretext of those who desire to get a pretext against us; on this account we
must be “on our guard that we be to no one a stumbling-block, neither to the Jews, nor to
the Gentiles, nor yet to the Church of God; and we must not seek that which is profitable
to ourselves only, but that which is for the profit of many, so that they may be saved.”454
For this does not profit us, that another stumble because of us. Let us, therefore, be studiously
on our guard at all times, that we do not smite our brethren and give them to drink of a
disquieting conscience through our being to them a stumbling-block. For “if for the sake
of meat our brother be made sad, or shocked, or made weak, or caused to stumble, we are
not walking in the love of God. For the sake of meat thou causest him to perish for whose
sake Christ died.”455 For, in “thus sinning against your brethren and wounding their sickly
consciences, ye sin against Christ Himself. For, if for the sake of meat my brother is made
to stumble,” let us who are believers say, “Never will we eat flesh, that we may not make our
brother to stumble.”456 These things, moreover, does ever one who truly loves God, who
truly takes up his cross, and puts on Christ, and loves his neighbour; the man who watches
over himself that he be not a stumbling-block to any one, that no one be caused to stumble
because of him and die because he is constantly with maidens and lives in the same house
with them—a thing which is not right—to the overthrow of those who see and hear. Evil
conduct like this is fraught with stumbling and peril, and is akin457 to death. But blessed
is that man who is circumspect and fearful in everything for the sake of purity!</p>

<p>If, moreover, it chance that we go to a place in which there are no Christians, and it be
important for us to stay there a few days, let us be “wise as serpents, and harmless as
doves;”458 and let us “not be as the foolish, but as the wise,”459 in all the self-restraint of the
fear of God, that God may be glorified in everything through our Lord Jesus Christ, through
our chaste and holy behaviour. For, “whether we eat, or drink, or do anything else, let us
do it as for the glory of God.”460 Let “all those who see us acknowledge that we are a blessed
seed,”461 “sons of the living God,”462 in everything—in all our words in shamefastness, in
purity, in humility, forasmuch as we do not copy the heathen in anything, nor are as believers
like other men, but in everything are estranged from the wicked. And we “do not cast that
which is holy before dogs, nor pearls before swine;”463 but with all possible self-restraint,
and with all discretion, and with all fear of God, and with earnestness of mind we praise
God. For we do not minister where heathens are drinking and blaspheming in their feasts
with words of impurity, because of their wickedness.464 Therefore do we not sing psalms
to the heathens, nor do we read to them the Scriptures, that we may not be like common
singers, either those who play on the lyre,465 or those who sing with the voice, or like
soothsayers, as many are, who follow these practices and do these things, that they may sate
themselves with a paltry mouthful of bread, and who, for the sake of a sorry cup of wine,
go about “singing the songs of the Lord in the strange land”466 of the heathen, and doing
what is not right. Do not so, my brethren; we beseech you, my brethren, let not these deeds
be done among you; but put away those who choose thus to behave themselves with infamy
and disgrace. It is not proper, my brethren, that these things should be so. But we beseech
you, brethren in righteousness, that these things be so done with you as with us, as for a
pattern of believers, and of those who shall believe. Let us be of the flock of Christ, in all
righteousness, and in all holy and unblemished conduct, behaving ourselves with uprightness
and sanctity, as is right for believers, and observing those things which are praiseworthy,

men, by reason of the constancy with which they have associated with one another. And

Bathsheba—when he saw her as she was cleansing herself and washing unclothed. This
woman the holy man saw, and was thoroughly478 captivated with desire by the sight of
her.479 See, then, what evils he committed because of a woman, and how this righteous man
sinned, and gave command that the husband of this woman should be killed in battle. Ye
have seen what wicked schemes he laid and executed, and how, because of his passion for
a woman, he perpetrated a murder—he, David, who was called “the anointed of the Lord.”480
Be admonished, O man: for, if such men as these have been brought to ruin through women,
what is thy righteousness, or what art thou among the holy, that thou consortest with women
and with maidens day and night, with much silliness, without fear of God? Not thus, my

spoken concerning a woman: “Her hands lay snares, and her heart spreadeth nets; but the
just shall escape from her, whilst the wicked falleth into her hands.”481 Therefore let us,

days of Susanna, who, because they were constantly with women, and looking upon the
beauty which was another’s,486 fell into the depths of wantonness, and were not able to keep
themselves in a chaste mind,487 but were overcome by a depraved disposition, and came
suddenly488 upon the blessed Susanna to corrupt her. But she did not consent to their foul
passion, but cried unto God, and God saved her out of the hands of the bad old men. Does
it not, therefore, behove us to tremble and be afraid, forasmuch as these old men, judges
and elders of the people of God, fell from their dignity because of a woman? For they did
not keep in mind that which is said: “Look thou not on the beauty which is another’s;” and,
“The beauty of woman has destroyed many;”489 and “With a married woman do not sit;”490
and that, again, in which it says: “Is there any one that puts fire in his bosom, and does not
burn his clothes;”491 or, “Does a man walk on fire, and his feet are not scorched? So whosoever
goeth in to another man’s wife is not pure from evil, and whosoever comes near to
her shall not escape.”492 And again it says: “Thou shalt not long after the beauty a woman,
lest she take thee captive with her eyelids;”493 and, “Thou shalt not look upon a maiden,
lest thou perish through desire of her;”494 and, “With a woman that sings beautifully thou
shalt not constantly be;”495 and, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”496</p>

<p>But see what it says also concerning those holy men, the prophets, and concerning the
apostles of our Lord. Let us see whether any one of these holy men was constantly with
maidens, or with young married women, or with such widows as the divine apostle declines
to receive. Let us consider, in the fear of God, the manner of life of these holy men. Lo! we
find it written concerning Moses and Aaron, that they acted and lived in the company of497
men, who themselves also followed a course of conduct like theirs. And thus did Joshua
also, the son of Nun. Woman was there none with them; but they by themselves used holily
to minister before God, men with men. And not only so; but they taught the people, that,
whensoever the host moved, every tribe should move on apart, and the women with the
women apart, and that they should go into the rear behind the host, and the men also apart
by their tribes. And, according to the command of the Lord, so did they set out, like a wise
people, that there might be no disorder on account of the women when the host moved.
With beautiful and well-ordered arrangements did they march without stumbling. For lo!
the Scriptures bear testimony to my words: “When the children of Israel had crossed over
the Sea of Suth, Moses and the children of Israel sang the praises of the Lord, and said: We
will praise the Lord, because He is exceedingly to be praised.”498 And, after that Moses had
finished499 singing praises, then Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, took a timbrel in
her hands, and all the women went out after her, and sang praises with her, women with
women apart, and men with men apart. Then again, we find that Elisha and Gehazi and
the sons of the prophets lived together in the fear of God, and that they had no females living
with them. Micah too, and all the prophets likewise, we find to have lived in this manner
in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Example of Jesus; How We May Allow Ourselves to Be Served
by Women.</head>
<p>And, not to extend our discourse to too great length, what shall we say concerning our
Lord Jesus Christ? Our Lord Himself was constantly with His twelve disciples when He
had come forth to the world. And not only so; but also, when He was sending them out, He
sent them out two and two together, men with men; but women were not sent with them,
and neither in the highway nor in the house did they associate with women or with maidens:
and thus they pleased God in everything. Also, when our Lord Jesus Christ Himself was
talking with the woman of Samaria by the well alone, “His disciples came” and found Him
talking with her, “and wondered that Jesus was standing and talking with a woman.”500 Is
He not a rule, such as may not be set aside, an example, and a pattern to all the tribes of
men? And not only so; but also, when our Lord was risen from the place of the dead, and
Mary came to the place of sepulture, she ran and fell at the feet of our Lord and worshipped
Him, and would have taken hold of Him. But He said to her: “Touch Me not; for I am not
yet ascended to My Father.”501 Is it not, then, matter for astonishment, that, while our Lord
did not allow Mary, the blessed woman, to touch His feet, yet thou livest with them, and art
waited on by women and maidens, and sleepest where they sleep, and women wash thy feet
for thee, and anoint thee! Alas for this culpable state of mind! Alas for this state of mind
which is destitute of fear! Alas for this affrontery and folly, which is without fear of God!
Dost thou not judge thine own self? Dost thou not examine thine own self? Dost thou not
know thine own self and the measure of thy strength? These things, moreover, are trustworthy,
and these things are true and right; and these are rules immutable for those who
behave themselves uprightly in our Lord. Many holy women, again, ministered to holy men
of their substance, as the Shunammite woman ministered to Elisha; but she did not live with
him, but the prophet lived in a house apart. And, when her son died, she wanted to throw
herself at the feet of the prophet; but his attendant would not allow her, but restrained her.
But Elisha said to his servant: “Let her alone, because her soul is distressed.”502 From these
things, then, we ought to understand their manner of life. To Jesus Christ our Lord women
ministered of their substance: but they did not live with him; but chastely, and holily, and
unblameably they behaved before the Lord, and finished their course, and received the
crown in503 our Lord God Almighty.</p>

<pb n="130"/>
<head>Introductory Notice
to the
Pseudo-Clementine Literature.</head>
<p>By Professor M. B. Riddle, D.D.</p>
<p>The name “Pseudo-Clementine Literature” (or, more briefly, “Clementina”) is applied
to a series of writings, closely resembling each other, purporting to emanate from the great
Roman Father. But, as Dr. Schaff remarks, in this literature he is evidently confounded with
“Flavius Clement, kinsman of the Emperor Domitian.”504 These writings are three in
number: (1) the Recognitions, of which only the Latin translation of Rufinus has been preserved;
505 (2) the Homilies, twenty in number, of which a complete collection has been
known since 1853; (3) the Epitome, “an uninteresting extract from the Homilies, to which
are added extracts from the letter of Clement to James, from the Martyrium of Clement by
Simeon Metaphrastes, etc.”506 Other writings may be classed with these; but they are of the
same general character, except that most of them show the influence of a later age, adapting
the material more closely to the orthodox doctrine.</p>
<p>The Recognitions and the Homilies appear in the pages which follow. The former are
given a prior position, as in the Edinburgh series. It probably cannot be proven that these
represent the earlier form of this theological romance; but the Homilies, “in any case, present
the more doctrinally developed and historically important form of the other treatises, which
are essentially similar.”507 They are therefore with propriety placed after the Recognitions,
which do not seem to have been based upon them, but upon some earlier document.508</p>
<p>The critical discussion of the Clementina has been keen, but has not reached its end. It
necessarily involves other questions, about which there is still great difference of opinion.
A few results seem to be established:—</p>
<p>(1) The entire literature is of Jewish-Christian, or Ebionitic, origin. The position accorded
to “James, the Lord’s brother,” in all the writings, is a clear indication of this; so is the
silence respecting the Apostle Paul. The doctrinal statements, “though not perfectly homo-

geneous” (Uhlhorn), are Judaistic, even when mixed with Gnostic speculation of heathen
origin. This tendency is, perhaps, not so clearly marked in the Recognitions as in the Homilies;
but both partake largely of the same general character. More particularly, the literature
has been connected with the Ebionite sect called the Elkesaites; and some regard the Homilies
as containing a further development of their system.509 This is not definitely established,
but finds some support in the resemblance between the baptismal forms, as given by Hippolytus
in the case of the Elkesaites,510 and those indicated in the Recognitions and Homilies,
especially the latter.511</p>
<p>(2) The entire literature belongs to the class of fictitious writing “with a purpose.” The
Germans properly term the Homilies a “Tendenz-Romance.” The many “lives of Christ”
written in our day to insinuate some other view of our Lord’s person than that given in the
canonical Gospels, furnish abundant examples of the class. The Tübingen school, finding
here a real specimen of the influence of party feeling upon quasi-historical literature, naturally
pressed the Clementina in support of their theory of the origin of the Gospels.</p>
<p>(3) The discussion leaves it quite probable, though not yet certain, that all the works
are “independent elaborations—perhaps at first hand, perhaps at second or third—of some
older tract not now extant.”512 Some of the opinions held respecting the relations of the
two principal works are given by the Edinburgh translator in his Introductory Notice. It is
only necessary here to indicate the progress of the modern discussion. Neander, as early as
1818, gave some prominence to the doctrinal view of the Homilies. He was followed by
Baur, who found in these writings, as indicated above, support for his theory of the origin
of historical Christianity. It is to be noted, however, that the heterogeneous mixture of
Ebionism and Gnosticism in the doctrinal views proved perplexing to the leader of the
Tübingen school. Schliemann513 took ground against Baur, collecting much material, and
carefully investigating the question. Both authors give the priority to the Homilies. While
Baur went too far in one direction, Schliemann, perhaps, failed to recognise fully the basis
of truth in the position of the former. The next important step in the discussion was made
by Hilgenfeld,514 whose views are briefly given in the Notice which follows. Hilgenfeld as-

signed the priority to the Recognitions, though he traced all the literature to an earlier work.
Uhlhorn515 at first attempted to prove that the Recognitions were a revision of the Homilies.
Further contributions were made by Lehmann516 and Lipsius.517 The former discovered
in the Recognitions two distinct parts by different authors (i.–iii., iv.–ix.), tracing all the literature
to the Kerygma of Peter. The latter finds the basis of the whole in the Acta Petri,
which show a strong anti-Pauline tendency.</p>
<p>Influenced by these investigations, Uhlhorn modified his views. Lechler,518 while not
positive in his convictions, makes the following prudent statement: “An older work lies at
the basis both of the Homilies and Recognitions, bearing the title, Kerygmen des Petrus.519
To this document sometimes the Homilies, sometimes the Recognitions, correspond more
faithfully; its historical contents are more correctly seen from the Recognitions, its doctrinal
contents from the Homilies.” Other views, some of them quite fanciful, have been presented.</p>
<p>The prevalent opinion necessarily leaves us in ignorance of the authors of this literature.
The date of composition, or editing, cannot be definitely fixed. In their present form the
several works may be as old as the first half of the third century, and the common basis may
be placed in the latter half of the second century.</p>
<p>How far the anti-Pauline tendency is carried, is a matter of dispute. Baur and many
others think Simon is meant to represent Paul;520 but this is difficult to believe, though we
must admit the disposition to ignore the Apostle to the Gentiles. As to the literary merit of
these productions the reader must judge.</p>
<p>For convenience in comparison of the two works, the following table has been prepared,
based on the order of the Recognitions. The correspondences are not exact, and the reader

<head>Introductory Notice
to
The Recognitions of Clement.</head>
<p>[By the Translator, Rev. Thomas Smith, D.D.]</p>
<p>The Recognitions of Clement is a kind of philosophical and theological romance. The
writer of the work seems to have had no intention of presenting his statements as facts; but,
choosing the disciples of Christ and their followers as his principal characters, he has put
into their mouths the most important of his beliefs, and woven the whole together by a
thread of fictitious narrative.</p>
<p>The Recognitions is one of a series; the other members of which that have come down
to us are the Clementine Homilies and two Epitomes.521</p>
<p>The authorship, the date, and the doctrinal character of these books have been subjects
of keen discussion in modern times. Especial prominence has been given to them by the
Tübingen school. Hilgenfeld says: “There is scarcely a single writing which is of so great
importance for the history of Christianity in its first stage, and which has already given such
brilliant disclosures at the hands of the most renowned critics in regard to the earliest history
of the Christian Church, as the writings ascribed to the Roman Clement, the Recognitions
and Homilies.”522 The importance thus attached to these strange and curious documents
by one school of theologians, has compelled men of all shades of belief to investigate the
subject; but after all their investigations, a great variety of opinion still prevails on almost
every point connected with these books.</p>
<note type="footnote">521 [See supra, p. 69, and Introductory Notice to Homilies.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">522 Die Clementinischen Rekognitionen und Homilien, nach ihrem Ursprung und Inhalt dargestellt, von Dr.
Adolf Hilgenfeld, Jena, 1848, p. 1. [Despite the morbid taste of this school for heretical writings, and the now
proven incorrectness of the “tendency-theory,” due credit must be given to Baur and his followers for awakening
a better critical discernment among the students of ecclesiastical history. Hilgenfeld’s judgments, in the higher
and lower criticism also, are frequently very incorrect; but he has done much to further a correct estimate of the
Clementina. See Introductory Notice, supra.—R.]</note>

<pb n="135"/>
<p>We leave our readers to judge for themselves in regard to the doctrinal statements, and
confine ourselves to a notice of some of the opinions in regard to the authorship and date
of the Recognitions.523</p>
<p>The first question that suggests itself in regard to the Recognitions is, whether the Recognitions
or the Homilies are the earliest form of the book, and what relation do they bear to
each other? Some maintain that they are both the productions of the same author, and that
the one is a later and altered edition of the other; and they find some confirmation of this
in the preface of Rufinus. Others think that both books are expansions of another work
which formed the basis. And others maintain that the one book is a rifacimento of the other
by a different hand. Of this third party, some, like Cave, Whiston, Rosenmüller, Staüdlin,
Hilgenfeld, and many others, believe that the Recognitions was the earliest524 of the two
forms; while others, as Clericus, Möhler, Lücke, Schliemann, and Uhlhorn, give priority to
the Clementines. Hilgenfeld supposes that the original writing was the Κήρυγμα Πέτρου,
which still remains in the work; that besides this there are three parts,—one directed against
Basilides, the second the Travels of Peter (περίοδοι) and the third the Recognitions. There
are also, he believes, many interpolated passages of a much later date than any of these
parts.525</p>
<p>No conclusion has been reached in regard to the author. Some have believed that it is
a genuine work of Clement. Whiston maintained that it was written by some of his hearers
and companions. Others have attributed the work to Bardesanes. But most acknowledge
that there is no possibility of discovering who was the author.</p>
<p>Various opinions exist as to the date of the book. It has been attributed to the first,
second, third, and fourth centuries, and some have assigned even a later date. If we were
to base our arguments on the work as it stands, the date assigned would be somewhere in
the first half of the third century. A passage from the Recognitions is quoted by Origen526
in his Commentary on Genesis, written in 231; and mention is made in the work of the extension
of the Roman franchise to all nations under the dominion of Rome,—an event which
took place in the region of Caracalla, a.d. 211. The Recognitions also contains a large extract
from the work De Fato, ascribed to Bardesanes, but really written by a scholar of his. Some
have thought that Bardesanes or his scholar borrowed from the Recognitions; but more re-

re-union of the scattered members of the Clementine family, who all at last find themselves together in Christianity,

<pb n="136"/>
cently the opinion has prevailed, that the passage was not originally in the Recognitions, but
was inserted in the Recognitions towards the middle of the third century, or even later.527</p>
<p>Those who believe the work made up of various documents assign various dates to these
documents. Hilgenfeld, for instance, believes that the Κήρυγμα Πέτρου was written before
the time of Trojan, and the Travels of Peter about the time of his reign.</p>
<p>Nothing is known of the place in which the Recognitions was written. Some, as
Schliemann, have supposed Rome, some Asia Minor, and recently Uhlhorn has tried to
trace it to Eastern Syria.528</p>
<p>The Greek of the Recognitions is lost. The work has come down to us in the form of a
translation by Rufinus of Aquileia (d. 410 a.d.). In his letter to Gaudentius, Rufinus states
that he omitted some portions difficult of comprehension, but that in regard to the other
parts he had translated with care, and an endeavour to be exact even in rendering the
phraseology.</p>
<p>The best editions of the Recognitions are those by Cotelerius, often reprinted, and by
Gersdorf, Lipsiæ, 1838; but the text is not in a satisfactory condition.</p>

Recognitions in Rome.” But Rufinus gives no intimation of the Roman origin of the Greek work he translated.
Still, the apparently more orthodox character of the Recognitions suggests an editor from the Western Church.—R.]</note>

<p>To Bishop Gaudentius.</p>
<p>To thee, indeed, O Gaudentius, thou choice glory of our doctors, belongs such vigour
of mind, yea, such grace of the Spirit, that whatever you say even in the course of your daily
preaching, whatever you deliver in the church, ought to be preserved in books, and handed
down to posterity for their instruction. But we, whom slenderness of wit renders less ready,
and now old age renders slow and inactive, though after many delays, yet at length present
to you the work which once the virgin Sylvia of venerable memory enjoined upon us, that
we should render Clement into our language, and you afterwards by hereditary right demanded
of us; and thus we contribute to the use and profit of our people, no small spoil, as I
think, taken from the libraries of the Greeks, so that we may feed with foreign nourishment
those whom we cannot with our own. For foreign things usually seem both more pleasant,
and sometimes also more profitable. In short, almost everything is foreign that brings
healing to our bodies, that opposes diseases, and neutralizes poisons. For Judæa sends us
Lacryma balsami, Crete Coma dictamni, Arabia her flower of spices, India reaps her crop
of spikenard; which, although they reach us in a somewhat more broken condition than
when they leave their native fields, yet retain entire the sweetness of their odour and their
healing virtue. Receive therefore, my soul,529 Clement returning to you; receive him now
in a Roman dress. And wonder not if haply the florid countenance of eloquence appear less
in him than usual. It matters not, provided the sense tastes the same. Therefore we transport
foreign merchandise into our country with much labour. And I know not with how grateful
countenances my countrymen welcome me, bringing to them the rich spoils of Greece, and
unlocking hidden treasures of wisdom with the key of our language. But may God grant
your prayers, that no unlucky eye nor any livid aspect may meet us, lest, by an extreme kind
of prodigy, while those from whom he is taken do not envy, yet those upon whom he is bestowed
should repine. Truly it is right to point out the plan of our translation to you, who
have read these works also in Greek, lest haply in some parts you may think the order of
translation not kept. I suppose you are aware that there are two editions in Greek of this
work of Clement,—the ᾽Αναγνώσεις , that is, Recognitions; and that there are two collections
of books, differing in some points, but in many containing the same narrative. In short, the

<pb n="138"/>
last part of this work, in which is the relation concerning the transformation of Simon, is
contained in one of the collections, but is not at all in the other.530 There are also in both
collections some dissertations concerning the Unbegotten God and the Begotten, and on
some other subjects, which, to say nothing more, are beyond our comprehension.531 These,
therefore, as being beyond our powers, I have chosen to reserve for others, rather than to
produce in an imperfect state. But in the rest, we have given our endeavour, so far as we
could, not to vary either from the sentiments or even from the language and modes of expression;
and this, although it renders the style of the narrative less ornate, yet it makes it
more faithful. The epistle in which the same Clement, writing to James the Lord’s brother,
informs him of the death of Peter, and that he had left him his successor in his chair and
teaching, and in which also the whole subject of church order is treated, I have not prefixed

seem to some to be inconsistent. For some ask, Since Linus and Cletus were bishops in the
city of Rome before this Clement, how could Clement himself, writing to James, say that
the chair of teaching was handed over to him by Peter?533 Now of this we have heard this
explanation, that Linus and Cletus were indeed bishops in the city of Rome before Clement,
but during the lifetime of Peter: that is, that they undertook the care of the episcopate, and
that he fulfilled the office of apostleship; as is found also to have been the case at Cæsarea,
where, when he himself was present, he yet had Zacchæus, ordained by himself, as bishop.
And in this way both statements will appear to be true, both that these bishops are reckoned

<head>Chapter I.—Clement’s Early History; Doubts.</head>
<p>I Clement, who was born in the city of Rome,534 was from my earliest age a lover of
chastity; while the bent of my mind held me bound as with chains of anxiety and sorrow.
For a thought that was in me—whence originating, I cannot tell—constantly led me to think
of my condition of mortality, and to discuss such questions as these: Whether there be for
me any life after death, or whether I am to be wholly annihilated: whether I did not exist
before I was born, and whether there shall be no remembrance of this life after death, and
so the boundlessness of time shall consign all things to oblivion and silence; so that not only
we shall cease to be, but there shall be no remembrance that we have ever been. This also
I revolved in my mind: when the world was made, or what was before it was made, or
whether it has existed from eternity. For it seemed certain, that if it had been made, it must
be doomed to dissolution; and if it be dissolved, what is to be afterwards?—unless, perhaps,
all things shall be buried in oblivion and silence, or something shall be, which the mind of
man cannot now conceive.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—His Distress.</head>
<p>While I was continually revolving in my mind these and such like questions, suggested
I know not how, I was pining away wonderfully through excess of grief; and, what was worse,
if at any time I thought to cast aside such cares, as being of little use, the waves of anxiety
rose all the higher upon me. For I had in me that most excellent companion, who would
not suffer me to rest—the desire of immortality: for, as the subsequent issue showed, and
the grace of Almighty God directed, this bent of mind led me to the quest of truth, and the
acknowledgment of the true light; and hence it came to pass, that ere long I pitied those
whom formerly in my ignorance I believed to be happy.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—His Dissatisfaction with the Schools of the Philosophers.</head>
<p>Having therefore such a bent of mind from my earliest years, the desire of learning
something led me to frequent the schools of the philosophers. There I saw that nought else
was done, save that doctrines were asserted and controverted without end, contests were
waged, and the arts of syllogisms and the subtleties of conclusions were discussed. If at any
time the doctrine of the immortality of the soul prevailed, I was thankful; if at any time it
was impugned, I went away sorrowful. Still, neither doctrine had the power of truth over
my heart. This only I understood, that opinions and definitions of things were accounted
true or false, not in accordance with their nature and the truth of the arguments, but in
proportion to the talents of those who supported them. And I was all the more tortured in
the bottom of my heart, because I was neither able to lay hold of any of those things which
were spoken as firmly established, nor was I able to lay aside the desire of inquiry; but the
more I endeavoured to neglect and despise them, so much the more eagerly, as I have said,
did a desire of this sort, creeping in upon me secretly as with a kind of pleasure, take possession
of my heart and mind.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="143"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—His Increasing Disquiet.</head>
<p>Being therefore straitened in the discovery of things, I said to myself, Why do we labour
in vain, since the end of things is manifest? For if after death I shall be no more, my present
torture is useless; but if there is to be for me a life after death, let us keep for that life the
excitements that belong to it, lest perhaps some sadder things befall me than those which I
now suffer, unless I shall have lived piously and soberly; and, according to the opinions of
some of the philosophers, I be consigned to the stream of dark-rolling Phlegethon, or to
Tartarus, like Sisyphus and Tityus, and to eternal punishment in the infernal regions, like
Ixion and Tantalus. And again I would answer to myself: But these things are fables; or if
it be so, since the matter is in doubt, it is better to live piously. But again I would ponder
with myself, How should I restrain myself from the lust of sin, while uncertain as to the reward
of righteousness?—and all the more when I have no certainty what righteousness is,
or what is pleasing to God; and when I cannot ascertain whether the soul be immortal, and
be such that it has anything to hope for; nor do I know what the future is certainly to be.
Yet still I cannot rest from thoughts of this sort.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—His Design to Test the Immortality of the Soul.</head>
<p>What, then, shall I do? This shall I do. I shall proceed to Egypt, and there I shall cultivate
the friendship of the hierophants or prophets, who preside at the shrines. Then I shall win
over a magician by money, and entreat him, by what they call the necromantic art, to bring
me a soul from the infernal regions, as if I were desirous of consulting it about some business.
But this shall be my consultation, whether the soul be immortal. Now, the proof that the
soul is immortal will be put past doubt, not from what it says, or from what I hear, but from
what I see: for seeing it with my eyes, I shall ever after hold the surest conviction of its immortality;
and no fallacy of words or uncertainty of hearing shall ever be able to disturb the
persuasion produced by sight. However, I related this project to a certain philosopher with
whom I was intimate, who counselled me not to venture upon it; “for,” said he, “if the soul
should not obey the call of the magician, you henceforth will live more hopelessly, as
thinking that there is nothing after death, and also as having tried things unlawful. If,
however, you seem to see anything, what religion or what piety can arise to you from things
unlawful and impious? For they say that transactions of this sort are hateful to the Divinity,
and that God sets Himself in opposition to those who trouble souls after their release from
the body.” When I heard this, I was indeed staggered in my purpose; yet I could not in any
way either lay aside my longing, or cast off the distressing thought.</p>

<p>Not to make a long story of it, whilst I was tossed upon these billows of my thought, a
certain report, which took its rise in the regions of the East in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar,
gradually reached us; and gaining strength as it passed through every place, like some good
message sent from God, it was filling the whole world, and suffered not the divine will to
be concealed in silence. For it was spread over all places, announcing that there was a certain
person in Judæa, who, beginning in the springtime,535 was preaching the kingdom of God
to the Jews, and saying that those should receive it who should observe the ordinances of
His commandments and His doctrine. And that His speech might be believed to be worthy
of credit, and full of the Divinity, He was said to perform many mighty works, and wonderful
signs and prodigies by His mere word; so that, as one having power from God, He made
the deaf to hear, and the blind to see, and the lame to stand erect, and expelled every infirmity
and all demons from men; yea, that He even raised dead persons who were brought to Him;
that He cured lepers also, looking at them from a distance; and that there was absolutely
nothing which seemed impossible to Him. These and such like things were confirmed in
process of time, not now by frequent rumours, but by the plain statements of persons
coming from those quarters; and day by day the truth of the matter was further disclosed.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Arrival of Barnabas at Rome.</head>
<p>At length meetings began to be held in various places in the city, and this subject to be
discussed in conversation, and to be a matter of wonder who this might be who had appeared,
and what message He had brought from God to men; until, about the same year, a certain
man, standing in a most crowded place in the city, made proclamation to the people, saying:
“Hear me, O ye citizens of Rome. The Son of God is now in the regions of Judæa, promising
eternal life to every one who will hear Him, but upon condition that he shall regulate his
actions according to the will of Him by whom He hath been sent, even of God the Father.
Wherefore turn ye from evil things to good, from things temporal to things eternal. Acknowledge
that there is one God, ruler of heaven and earth, in whose righteous sight ye unrighteous
inhabit His world. But if ye be converted, and act according to His will, then, coming to
the world to come, and being made immortal, ye shall enjoy His unspeakable blessings and
rewards.”536 Now, the man who spoke these things to the people was from the regions of
the East, by nation a Hebrew, by name Barnabas, who said that he himself was one of His
disciples, and that he was sent for this end, that he should declare these things to those who
would hear them.537 When I heard these things, I began, with the rest of the multitude, to
follow him, and to hear what he had to say. Truly I perceived that there was nothing of
dialectic artifice in the man, but that he expounded with simplicity, and without any craft
of speech, such things as he had heard from the Son of God, or had seen. For he did not
confirm his assertions by the force of arguments, but produced, from the people who stood
round about him, many witnesses of the sayings and marvels which he related.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—His Preaching.</head>
<p>Now, inasmuch as the people began to assent willingly to the things which were sincerely
spoken, and to embrace his simple discourse, those who thought themselves learned or
philosophic began to laugh at the man, and to flout him, and to throw out for him the
grappling-hooks of syllogisms, like strong arms. But he, unterrified, regarding their subtleties
as mere ravings, did not even judge them worthy of an answer, but boldly pursued the subject
which he had set before him. At length, some one having proposed this question to him as
he was speaking, Why a gnat has been so formed, that though it is a small creature, and has
six feet, yet it has got wings in addition; whereas an elephant, though it is an immense animal,
and has no wings, yet has only four feet; he, paying no attention to the question, went on
with his discourse, which had been interrupted by the unseasonable challenge, only adding
this admonition at every interruption: “We have it in charge to declare to you the words
and the wondrous works of Him who hath sent us, and to confirm the truth of what we
speak, not by artfully devised arguments, but by witnesses produced from amongst
yourselves. For I recognise many standing in the midst of you whom I remember to have
heard along with us the things which we have heard, and to have seen what we have seen.
But be it in your option to receive or to spurn the tidings which we bring to you. For we
cannot keep back what we know to be for your advantage, because, if we be silent, woe is to
us; but to you, if you receive not what we speak, destruction. I could indeed very easily answer
your foolish challenges, if you asked for the sake of learning truth,—I mean as to the difference
of a gnat and an elephant; but now it were absurd to speak to you of these creatures,
when the very Creator and Framer of all things is unknown by you.”</p>

<p>When he had thus spoken, all, as with one consent, with rude voice raised a shout of
derision, to put him to shame, and to silence him, crying out that he was a barbarian and a
madman. When I saw matters going on in this way, being filled, I know not whence, with
a certain zeal, and inflamed with religious enthusiasm, I could not keep silence, but cried
out with all boldness, “Most righteously does Almighty God hide His will from you, whom
He foresaw to be unworthy of the knowledge of Himself, as is manifest to those who are
really wise, from what you are now doing. For when you see that preachers of the will of
God have come amongst you, because their speech makes no show of knowledge of the
grammatical art, but in simple and unpolished language they set before you the divine
commands, so that all who hear may be able to follow and to understand the things that are
spoken, you deride the ministers and messengers of your salvation, not knowing that it is
the condemnation of you who think yourselves skilful and eloquent, that rustic and barbarous
men have the knowledge of the truth; whereas, when it has come to you, it is not even received
as a guest, while, if your intemperance and lust did not oppose, it ought to have been a citizen
and a native. Thus you are convicted of not being friends of truth and philosophers, but
followers of boasting and vain speakers. Ye think that truth dwells not in simple, but in ingenious
and subtle words, and produce countless thousands of words which are not to be
rated at the worth of one word. What, then, do ye think will become of you, all ye crowd
of Greeks, if there is to be, as he says, a judgment of God? But now give over laughing at
this man to your own destruction, and let any one of you who pleases answer me; for, indeed,
by your barking you annoy the ears even of those who desire to be saved, and by your
clamour you turn aside to the fall of infidelity the minds that are prepared for faith. What
pardon can there be for you who deride and do violence to the messenger of the truth when
he offers to you the knowledge of God? whereas, even if he brought you nothing of truth,
yet, even for the kindness of his intentions towards you, you ought to receive with gratitude

my speech as in accordance with that feeling; others, petulant and stolid, rousing the anger
of their undisciplined minds as much against me as against Barnabas. But as the day was
declining to evening, I laid hold of Barnabas by the right hand, and led him away, although
reluctantly, to my house; and there I made him remain, lest perchance any one of the rude
rabble should lay hands upon him. While we were thus placed in contact for a few days, I
gladly heard him discoursing the word of truth; yet he hastened his departure, saying that
he must by all means celebrate at Judæa a festal day of his religion which was approaching,
and that there he should remain in future with his countrymen and his brethren, evidently

you, for I am extremely desirous to see Judæa, and perhaps I shall remain with you always.”
To this he answered, “If indeed you wish to see our country, and to learn those things which
you desire, set sail with me even now; or, if there be anything that detains you now, I shall
leave with you directions to my dwelling, so that when you please to come you may easily
find me; for tomorrow I shall set out on my journey.” When I saw him determined, I went
down with him to the harbour, and carefully took from him the directions which he gave
me to find his dwelling. I told him that, but for the necessity of getting some money which
was due to me, I should not at all delay, but that I should speedily follow him. Having told
him this, I commended him to the kindness of those who had charge of the ship, and returned
sad; for I was possessed of the memory of the intercourse which I had had with an excellent

after fifteen days landed at Cæsarea Stratonis, which is the largest city in Palestine.538 When
I had landed, and was seeking for an inn, I learned from the conversation of the people, that
one Peter, a most approved disciple of Him who appeared in Judæa, and showed many signs
and miracles divinely performed among men, was going to hold a discussion of words and
questions the next day with one Simon, a Samaritan. Having heard this, I asked to be shown
his lodging; and having found it, and standing before the door, I informed the doorkeeper
who I was, and whence I came; and, behold, Barnabas coming out, as soon as he saw me
rushed into my arms, weeping for joy, and, seizing me by the hand, led me in to Peter.
Having pointed him out to me at a distance, “This,” said he, “is Peter, of whom I spoke, to
you as the greatest in the wisdom of God, and to whom also I have spoken constantly of
you. Enter, therefore, as one well known to him. For he is well acquainted with all the good
that is in thee, and has carefully made himself aware of your religious purpose, whence also
he is greatly desirous to see you. Therefore I present you to him to-day as a great gift.” At

things which it does here. Further, I desire to know what that righteousness is, which is
pleasing to God; then, further, whether the world was created, and why it was created, and
whether it is to be dissolved, and whether it is to be renovated and made better, or whether
after this there shall be no world at all; and, not to mention everything, I should wish to be

from their inmost hearts to invoke His aid, who alone is not shut up in the smoke-filled

<p>“He, therefore, whose aid is needed for the house filled with the darkness of ignorance
and the smoke of vices, is He, we say, who is called the true Prophet, who alone can enlighten
the souls of men, so that with their eyes they may plainly see the way of safety. For otherwise
it is impossible to get knowledge of divine and eternal things, unless one learns of that true
Prophet; because, as you yourself stated a little ago, the belief of things, and the opinions of
causes, are estimated in proportion to the talents of their advocates: hence, also, one and
the same cause is now thought just, now unjust; and what now seemed true, anon becomes
false on the assertion of another. For this reason, the credit of religion and piety demanded
the presence of the true Prophet, that He Himself might tell us respecting each particular,
how the truth stands, and might teach us how we are to believe concerning each.539 And
therefore, before all else, the credentials of the prophet himself must be examined with all
care; and when you have once ascertained that he is a prophet, it behoves you thenceforth
to believe him in everything, and not further to discuss the particulars which he teaches,
but to hold the things which he speaks as certain and sacred; which things, although they
seem to be received by faith, yet are believed on the ground of the probation previously instituted.
For when once at the outset the truth of the prophet is established on examination,
the rest is to be heard and held on the ground of the faith by which it is already established
that he is a teacher of truth. And as it is certain that all things which pertain to divine
knowledge ought to be held according to the rule of truth, so it is beyond doubt that from
none but Himself alone can it be known what is true.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he set forth to me so openly and so clearly who that Prophet was,

hand, the proofs which he produced concerning the prophetic truth; and I was struck with
intense astonishment, how no one sees, though placed before his eyes, those things which
all are seeking for. Whence, by his command, reducing into order what he had spoken to
me, I compiled a book concerning the true Prophet, and sent it to you from Cæsarea by his
command. For he said that he had received a command from you to send you every year
an account of his sayings and doings.540 Meantime, at the beginning of his discourse which
he delivered to me the first day, when he had instructed me very fully concerning the true
Prophet, and very many things besides, he added also this: “See,” said he, “for the future,
and be present at the discussions which whenever any necessity arises, I shall hold with
those who contradict; against whom, when I dispute, even if I shall seem to be worsted, I
shall not be afraid of your being led to doubt of those things which I have stated to you;
because, even if I shall seem to be beaten, yet those things shall not therefore seem to be
uncertain which the true Prophet has delivered to us. Yet I hope that we shall not be overcome
in disputations either, if only our hearers are reasonable, and friends of truth, who
can discern the force and bearing of words, and recognise what discourse comes from the
sophistical art, not containing truth, but an image of truth; and what that is, which, uttered
simply and without craft, depends for all its power not on show and ornament, but on truth
and reason.”</p>

to doubt of those things which I have learned of you; so that even if you yourself should at
any time wish to transfer my faith from the true Prophet, you should not be able, because
I have drunk in with all my heart what you have spoken. And that you may not think that
I am promising you a great thing when I say that I cannot be moved away from this faith,
it is with me a certainty, that whoever has received this account of the true Prophet, can
never afterwards so much as doubt of its truth. And therefore I am confident with respect
to this heaven-taught doctrine, in which all the art of malice is overborne. For in opposition
to this prophecy neither any art can stand, nor the subtleties of sophisms and syllogism; but
every one who hears of the true Prophet must of necessity long immediately for the truth
itself, nor will he afterwards, under pretext of seeking the truth, endure diverse errors.
Wherefore, O my lord Peter, be not further anxious about me, as if I were one who does
not know what he has received, and how great a gift has been conferred on him. Be assured
that you have conferred a favour on one who knows and understands its value: nor can I
be easily deceived on that account, because I seem to have gotten quickly what I long desired;
for it may be that one who desires gets quickly, while another does not even slowly attain
the things which he desires.”</p>

<p>Then Peter, when he heard me speak thus, said: “I give thanks to my God, both for your
salvation and for my own peace; for I am greatly delighted to see that you have understood
what is the greatness of the prophetic virtue, and because, as you say, not even I myself, if
I should wish it (which God forbid!), should be able to turn you away to another faith. Now
henceforth begin to be with us, and to-morrow be present at our discussions, for I am to
have a contest with Simon the magician.” When he had thus spoken, he retired to take food
along with his friends; but he ordered me to eat by myself;541 and after the meal, when he
had sung praise to God and given thanks, he rendered to me an account of this proceeding,
and added, “May the Lord grant to thee to be made like to us in all things, that, receiving
baptism, thou mayest be able to meet with us at the same table.” Having thus spoken, he
ordered me to go to rest, for by this time both fatigue and the time of the day called to sleep.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Postponement of Discussion with Simon Magus.</head>
<p>Early next morning Zacchæus542 came in to us, and after salutation, said to Peter: “Simon
puts off the discussion till the eleventh day of the present month, which is seven days
hence, for he says that then he will have more leisure for the contest. But to me it seems
that his putting off is also advantageous to us, so that more may come together, who may
be either hearers or judges of our disputation. However, if it seem proper to you, let us occupy
the interval in discussing among ourselves the things which, we suppose, may come
into the controversy; so that each of us, knowing what things are to be proposed, and what
answers are to be given, may consider with himself if they are all right, or if an adversary
shall be able to find anything to object, or to set aside the things which we bring against
him. But if the things which are to be spoken by us are manifestly impregnable on every
side, we shall have confidence in entering upon the examination. And indeed, this is my
opinion, that first of all it ought to be inquired what is the origin of all things, or what is the
immediate543 thing which may be called the cause of all things which are: then, with respect
to all things that exist, whether they have been made, and by whom, through whom, and
for whom; whether they have received their subsistence from one, or from two, or from
many; and whether they have been taken and fashioned from none previously subsisting,
or from some: then, whether there is any virtue in the highest things, or in the lower;
whether there is anything which is better than all, or anything that is inferior to all; whether
there are any motions, or none; whether those things which are seen were always, and shall
be always; whether they have come into existence without a creator, and shall pass away
without a destroyer. If, I say, the discussion begin with these things, I think that the things
which shall be inquired into, being discussed with diligent examination, will be easily ascertained.
And when these are ascertained, the knowledge of those that follow will be easily
found. I have stated my opinion; be pleased to intimate what you think of the matter.544”</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Advantage of the Delay.</head>
<p>To this Peter answered: “Tell Simon in the meantime to do as he pleases, and to rest
assured that, Divine Providence granting, he shall always find us ready.” Then Zacchæus
went out to intimate to Simon what he had been told. But Peter, looking at us, and perceiving
that I was saddened by the putting off of the contest, said: “He who believes that the world
is administered by the providence of the Most High God, ought not, O Clement, my friend,
to take it amiss, in whatever way particular things happen, being assured that the righteousness
of God guides to a favourable and fitting issue even those things which seem superfluous
or contrary in any business, and especially towards those who worship Him more intimately;
and therefore he who is assured of these things, as I have said, if anything occur contrary
to his expectation, he knows how to drive away grief from his mind on that account, holding
it unquestionable in his better judgment, that, by the government of the good God, even
what seems contrary may be turned to good. Wherefore, O Clement, even now let not this
delay of the magician Simon sadden you: for I believe that it has been done by the providence
of God, for your advantage; that I may be able, in this interval of seven days, to expound to
you the method of our faith without any distraction, and the order continuously, according
to the tradition of the true Prophet, who alone knows the past as it was, the present as it is,
and the future as it shall be: which things were indeed plainly spoken by Him, but are not
plainly written; so much so, that when they are read, they cannot be understood without an
expounder, on account of the sin which has grown up with men, as I said before. Therefore
I shall explain all things to you, that in those things which are written you may clearly perceive
what is the mind of the Lawgiver.”</p>

<p>When he had said this, he began to expound to me point by point of those chapters of
the law which seemed to be in question, from the beginning of the creation even to that
point of time at which I came to him at Cæsarea, telling me that the delay of Simon had
contributed to my learning all things in order. “At other times,” said he, “we shall discourse
more fully on individual points of which we have now spoken shortly, according as the occasion
of our conversation shall bring them before us; so that, according to my promise,
you may gain a full and perfect knowledge of all. Since, then, by this delay we have to-day
on our hands, I wish to repeat to you again what has been spoken, that it may be the better
recalled to your memory.” Then he began in this way to refresh my recollection of what he
had said: “Do you remember, O friend Clement, the account I gave you of the eternal age,
that knows no end?” Then said I, “Never, O Peter, shall I retain anything, if I can lose or
forget that.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Repetition Continued.</head>
<p>Then Peter, having heard my answer with pleasure, said: “I congratulate you because
you have answered thus, not because you speak of these things easily, but because you profess
that you remember them; for the most sublime truths are best honoured by means of silence.
Yet, for the credit of those things which you remember concerning things not to be spoken,545
tell me what you retain of those things which we spoke of in the second place, which can
easily be spoken out, that, perceiving your tenacity of memory, I may the more readily point
out to you, and freely open, the things of which I wish to speak.” Then I, when I perceived
that he rejoiced in the good memory of his hearers, said: “Not only am I mindful of your
definition, but also of that preface which was prefixed to the definition; and of almost all
things that you have expounded, I retain the sense complete, though not all the words; because
the things that you have spoken have been made, as it were, native to my soul, and
inborn. For you have held out a most sweet cup to me in my excessive thirst. And that you
may not suppose that I am occupying you with words, being unmindful of things, I shall
now call to mind the things which were spoken, in which the order of your discussion greatly
helps me; for the way in which the things that you said followed by consequence upon one
another, and were arranged in a balanced manner, makes them easily recalled to memory
by the lines of their order. For the order of sayings is useful for remembering them: for
when you begin to follow them point by point in succession, when anything is wanting,
immediately the sense seeks for it; and when it has found it, retains it, or at all events, if it
cannot discover it, there will be no reluctance to ask it of the master. But not to delay in
granting what you demand of me, I shall shortly rehearse what you delivered to me concerning

multitude the election of the beloved, from whose oneness of mind the peaceful kingdom
of God is constructed. But the rest, which ought to follow these, you promised to tell me
at another time. After this, when you had explained about the creation of the world, you
intimated the decree of God, “which He, of His own good pleasure, announced in the
presence of all the first angels,” and which He ordained as an eternal law to all; and how He
established two kingdoms,—I mean that of the present time and that of the future,—and
appointed times to each, and decreed that a day of judgment should be expected, which He
determined, in which a severance is to be made of things and of souls: so that the wicked

<p>While I was going on thus, Peter, enraptured with joy, and anxious for me as if I had
been his son, lest perhaps I should fail in recollection of the rest, and be put to shame on
account of those who were present, said: “It is enough, O Clement; for you have stated these
things more clearly than I myself explained them.” Then said I, “Liberal learning has conferred
upon me the power of orderly narration, and of stating those things clearly for which
there is occasion. And if we use learning in asserting the errors of antiquity, we ruin ourselves
by gracefulness and smoothness of speech; but if we apply learning and grace of speech to
the assertion of the truth, I think that not a little advantage is thereby gained. Be that as it
may, my lord Peter, you can but imagine with what thankfulness I am transported for all
the rest of your instruction indeed, but especially for the statement of that doctrine which
you gave: There is one God, whose work the world is, and who, because He is in all respects
righteous, shall render to every one according to his deeds. And after that you added: For
the assertion of this dogma countless thousands of words will be brought forward; but in
those to whom is granted knowledge of the true Prophet, all this forest of words is cut down.
And on this account, since you have delivered to me a discourse concerning the true
Prophet, you have strengthened me with all confidence of your assertions.” And then,
having perceived that the sum of all religion and piety consists in this, I immediately replied:
“You have proceeded most excellently, O Peter: wherefore, in future, expound unhesitatingly,
as to one who already knows what are the foundations of faith and piety, the traditions of
the true Prophet, who alone, as has been clearly proved, is to be believed. But that exposition
which requires assertions and arguments, reserve for the unbelievers, to whom you have
not yet judged it proper to commit the indubitable faith of prophetic grace.” When I had
said this, I added: “You promised that you would give at the proper time two things: first
this exposition, at once simple and entirely free from error; and then an exposition of each
individual point as it may be evolved in the course of the various questions which shall be
raised. And after this you expounded the sequence of things in order from the beginning
of the world, even to the present time; and if you please, I can repeat the whole from
memory.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Friendship of God; How Secured.</head>
<p>To this Peter answered: “I am exceedingly delighted, O Clement, that I commit my
words to so safe a heart; for to be mindful of the things that are spoken is an indication of
having in readiness the faith of works. But he from whom the wicked demon steals away
the words of salvation, and snatches them away from his memory, cannot be saved, even
though he wish it; for he loses the way by which life is reached. Wherefore let us the rather
repeat what has been spoken, and confirm it in your heart, that is, in what manner or by
whom the world was made, that we may proceed to the friendship of the Creator. But His
friendship is secured by living well, and by obeying His will; which will is the law of all that
live. We shall therefore unfold these things briefly to you, in order that they may be the

<p>“In the beginning,546 when God had made the heaven and the earth,547 as one house,
the shadow which was cast by the mundane bodies involved in darkness those things which
were enclosed in it. But when the will of God had introduced light, that darkness which
had been caused by the shadows of bodies was straightway dispelled: then at length light is
appointed for the day, darkness for the night. And now the water which was within the
world, in the middle space of that first heaven and earth, congealed as if with frost, and
solid as crystal, is distended, and the middle spaces of the heaven and earth are separated
as by a firmament of this sort; and that firmament the Creator called heaven, so called by
the name of that previously made: and so He divided into two portions that fabric of the
universe, although it was but one house. The reason of the division was this, that the upper
portion might afford a dwelling-place to angels, and the lower to men. After this, the place
of the sea and the chaos which had been made received that portion of the water which remained
below, by order of the eternal Will; and these flowing down to the sunk and hollow
places, the dry land appeared; and the gatherings of the waters were made seas. And after
this the earth, which had appeared, produced various species of herbs and shrubs. It gave
forth fountains also, and rivers, not only in the plains, but on the mountains. And so all
things were prepared, that men who were to dwell in it might have it in their power to use
all these things according to their will, that is, either for good or evil.”</p>

much that occurs in the Homilies; the attempt to adjust the statements to the New-Testament narrative is skilfully

and illicit connections with these;549 and thenceforth acting in all things without discretion,
and disorderly, they changed the state of human affairs and the divinely prescribed order
of life, so that either by persuasion or force they compelled all men to sin against God their
Creator. In the ninth generation are born the giants, so called from of old,550 not dragonfooted,
as the fables of the Greeks relate, but men of immense bodies, whose bones, of
enormous size, are still shown in some places for confirmation. But against these the
righteous providence of God brought a flood upon the world, that the earth might be purified
from their pollution, and every place might be turned into a sea by the destruction of the
wicked. Yet there was then found one righteous man, by name Noah, who, being delivered

younger obtained the eastern quarter, and he the western. In the fourteenth generation one
of the cursed progeny first erected an altar to demons, for the purpose of magical arts, and
offered there bloody sacrifices. In the fifteenth generation, for the first time, men set up an
idol and worshipped it. Until that time the Hebrew language, which had been given by God
to men, bore sole sway. In the sixteenth generation the sons of men migrated from the east,
and, coming to the lands that had been assigned to their fathers, each one marked the place

fire, and when already the scourge was hanging over the whole earth, beginning with Sodom,
this man, by reason of his friendship with God, who was well pleased with him, obtained

to God; declared also the resurrection of the dead, the future judgment, the reward of the
good, the punishment of the evil,—all to be regulated by righteous judgment: and having
given him all this information plainly and sufficiently, He departed again to the invisible
abodes. But while Abraham was still in ignorance, as we said to you before, two sons were

Others settled in Arabia, of whose posterity some also have spread into Egypt.

She obtained a son. whom he named Isaac, from whom came Jacob, and from him the twelve
patriarchs, and from these twelve seventy-two. These, when famine befell came into Egypt
with all their family; and in the course of four hundred years, being multiplied by the
blessing and promise of God, they were afflicted by the Egyptians. And when they were
afflicted the true Prophet appeared to Moses,556 and struck the Egyptians with ten plagues,
when they refused to let the Hebrew people depart from them, and return to their native
land; and he brought the people of God out of Egypt. But those of the Egyptians who survived
the plagues, being infected with the animosity of their king, pursued after the Hebrews.
And when they had overtaken them at the sea-shore, and thought to destroy and exterminate
them all, Moses, pouring out prayer to God, divided the sea into two parts, so that the water
was held on the right hand and on the left as if it had been frozen, and the people of God
passed as over a dry road; but the Egyptians who were pursuing them, rashly entering, were
drowned. For when the last of the Hebrews came out, the last of the Egyptians went down

discipline of forty years, the novelty of a changed manner of life might root out the evils
which had clung to them by a long-continued familiarity with the customs of the Egyptians.
Meantime they came to Mount Sinai, and thence the law was given to them with voices and
sights from heaven, written in ten precepts, of which the first and greatest was that they
should worship God Himself alone, and not make to themselves any appearance or form557
to worship. But when Moses had gone up to the mount, and was staying there forty days,
the people, although they had seen Egypt struck with the ten plagues, and the sea parted
and passed over by them on foot, manna also given to them from heaven for bread, and
drink supplied to them out of the rock that followed558 them, which kind of food was turned
into whatever taste any one desired; and although, being placed under the torrid region of
heaven, they were shaded by a cloud in the day-time, that they might not be scorched by
the heat, and by night were enlightened by a pillar of fire, lest the horror of darkness should
be added to the wasteness of the wilderness;—those very people, I say, when Moses stayed
in the mount, made and worshipped a golden calf’s head, after the fashion of Apis, whom
they had seen worshipped in Egypt; and after so many and so great marvels which they had
seen, were unable to cleanse and wash out from themselves the defilements of old habit.
On this account, leaving the short road which leads from Egypt to Judæa, Moses conducted

indeed to sacrifice, but permitted it to be done only to God, that by any means he might cut
off one half of the deeply ingrained evil, leaving the other half to be corrected by another,
and at a future time; by Him, namely, concerning whom he said himself, ‘A prophet shall
the Lord your God raise unto you, whom ye shall hear even as myself, according to all things
which He shall say to you. Whosoever shall not hear that prophet, his soul shall be cut off
from his people.559</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—The Holy Place.</head>
<p>“In addition to these things, he also appointed a place in which alone it should be lawful
to them to sacrifice to God.560 And all this was arranged with this view, that when the fitting
time should come, and they should learn by means of the Prophet that God desires mercy
and not sacrifice,561 they might see Him who should teach them that the place chosen of
God, in which it was suitable that victims should be offered to God, is his Wisdom; and that
on the other hand they might hear that this place, which seemed chosen for a time, often
harassed as it had been by hostile invasions and plunderings, was at last to be wholly destroyed.
562 And in order to impress this upon them, even before the coming of the true
Prophet, who was to reject at once the sacrifices and the place, it was often plundered by
enemies and burnt with fire, and the people carried into captivity among foreign nations,
and then brought back when they betook themselves to the mercy of God; that by these
things they might be taught that a people who offer sacrifices are driven away and delivered
up into the hands of the enemy, but they who do mercy and righteousness are without sacrifices
freed from captivity, and restored to their native land. But it fell out that very few
understood this; for the greater number, though they could perceive and observe these
things, yet were held by the irrational opinion of the vulgar: for right opinion with liberty

went up to a certain mountain, and there died. Yet such was the manner of his death, that

fathers’ land, by the providence of God, at their first onset the inhabitants of wicked races
are routed, and they enter upon their paternal inheritance, which was distributed among
them by lot. For some time thereafter they were ruled not by kings, but judges, and remained
in a somewhat peaceful condition. But when they sought for themselves tyrants rather than

foretold that He should warn them by the mercy of God to cease from sacrificing; lest haply

He instituted baptism by water amongst them, in which they might be absolved from all
their sins on the invocation of His name, and for the future, following a perfect life, might
abide in immortality, being purified not by the blood of beasts, but by the purification of
the Wisdom of God. Subsequently also an evident proof of this great mystery is supplied
in the fact, that every one who, believing in this Prophet who had been foretold by Moses,
is baptized in His name, shall be kept unhurt from the destruction of war which impends

those who press on to the glory of safety and liberty, being rendered braver by their resistance

While this was going on, Caiaphas, the high priest, sent priests to us, and asked us to come
to him, that either we should prove to him that Jesus is the eternal Christ, or he to us that
He is not, and that so all the people should agree upon the one faith or the other; and this
he frequently entreated us to do. But we often put it off, always seeking for a more convenient
time.” Then I, Clement, answered to this: “I think that this very question, whether He is
the Christ, is of great importance for the establishment of the faith; otherwise the high priest
would not so frequently ask that he might either learn or teach concerning the Christ.”
Then Peter: “You have answered rightly, O Clement; for as no one can see without eyes,
nor hear without ears, nor smell without nostrils, nor taste without a tongue, nor handle
anything without hands, so it is impossible, without the true Prophet, to know what is
pleasing to God.” And I answered: “I have already learned from your instruction that this
true prophet is the Christ; but I should wish to learn what the Christ means, or why He is
so called, that a matter of so great importance may not be vague and uncertain to me.”</p>

<head>Chapter XLV.—The True Prophet: Why Called the Christ.</head>
<p>Then Peter began to instruct me in this manner:577 “When God had made the world,
as Lord of the universe, He appointed chiefs over the several creatures, over the trees even,
and the mountains, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all things which He had made, as
we have told you; for it were too long to mention them one by one. He set, therefore, an
angel as chief over the angels, a spirit over the spirits, a star over the stars, a demon over the
demons, a bird over the birds, a beast over the beasts, a serpent over the serpents, a fish over
the fishes, a man over men, who is Christ Jesus. But He is called Christ by a certain excellent
rite of religion; for as there are certain names common to kings, as Arsaces among the Persians,
Cæsar among the Romans, Pharaoh among the Egyptians, so among the Jews a king
is called Christ. And the reason of this appellation is this: Although indeed He was the Son
of God, and the beginning of all things, He became man; Him first God anointed with oil
which was taken from the wood of the tree of life: from that anointing therefore He is called
Christ. Thence, moreover, He Himself also, according to the appointment of His Father,
anoints with similar oil every one of the pious when they come to His kingdom, for their
refreshment after their labours, as having got over the difficulties of the way; so that their
light may shine, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, they may be endowed with immortality.
578 But it occurs to me that I have sufficiently explained to you the whole nature of that
branch from which that ointment is taken.”</p>

<head>Chapter XLVI.—Anointing.</head>
<p>“But now also I shall, by a very short representation, recall you to the recollection of all
these things. In the present life, Aaron, the first high priest,579 was anointed with a composition
of chrism, which was made after the pattern of that spiritual ointment of which we
have spoken before. He was prince of the people, and as a king received first-fruits and
tribute from the people, man by man; and having undertaken the office of judging the people,
he judged of things clean and things unclean. But if any one else was anointed with the
same ointment, as deriving virtue from it, he became either king, or prophet, or priest. If,
then, this temporal grace, compounded by men, had such efficacy, consider now how potent
was that ointment extracted by God from a branch of the tree of life, when that which was
made by men could confer so excellent dignities among men. For what in the present age
is more glorious than a prophet, more illustrious than a priest, more exalted than a king?”</p>

<head>Chapter XLVII.—Adam Anointed a Prophet.</head>
<p>To this, I replied: “I remember, Peter, that you told me of the first man that he was a
prophet; but you did not say that he was anointed. If then there be no prophet without
anointing, how could the first man be a prophet, since he was not anointed?” Then Peter,
smiling, said: “If the first man prophesied, it is certain that he was also anointed. For although
he who has recorded the law in his pages is silent as to his anointing, yet he has
evidently left us to understand these things. For as, if he had said that he was anointed, it
would not be doubted that he was also a prophet, although it were not written in the law;
so, since it is certain that he was a prophet, it is in like manner certain that he was also
anointed, because without anointing he could not be a prophet. But you should rather have
said, If the chrism was compounded by Aaron, by the perfumer’s art, how could the first
man be anointed before Aaron’s time, the arts of composition not yet having been discovered?”
Then I answered, “Do not misunderstand me, Peter; for I do not speak of that
compounded ointment and temporal oil, but of that simple and eternal ointment, which
you told me was made by God, after whose likeness you say that that other was compounded
by men.”</p>

Clement, that all of us can know all things before the time? But not to be drawn aside now
from our proposed discourse, we shall at another time, when your progress is more manifest,
explain these things more distinctly.</p>
<p>“Then, however, a priest or a prophet, being anointed with the compounded ointment,
putting fire to the altar of God, was held illustrious in all the world. But after Aaron, who
was a priest, another is taken out of the waters. I do not speak of Moses, but of Him who,
in the waters of baptism, was called by God His Son.580 For it is Jesus who has put out, by
the grace of baptism, that fire which the priest kindled for sins; for, from the time when He
appeared, the chrism has ceased, by which the priesthood or the prophetic or the kingly
office was conferred.”</p>

He should come, humble indeed in His first coming, but glorious in His second. And the
first, indeed, has been already accomplished; since He has come and taught, and He, the
Judge of all, has been judged and slain. But at His second coming He shall come to judge,
and shall indeed condemn the wicked, but shall take the pious into a share and association
with Himself in His kingdom. Now the faith of His second coming depends upon His first.
For the prophets—especially Jacob and Moses—spoke of the first, but some also of the
second. But the excellency of prophecy is chiefly shown in this, that the prophets spoke not
of things to come, according to the sequence of things; otherwise they might seem merely

to whom He came, and that they should believe on Him who was expected for the salvation
of the people, according to the traditions of the fathers; but that the Gentiles should be averse
to Him, since neither promise nor announcement concerning Him had been made to them,
and indeed he had never been made known to them even by name. Yet the prophets, contrary
to the order and sequence of things, said that He should be the expectation of the Gentiles,
and not of the Jews.581 And so it happened. For when He came, he was not at all acknowledged
by those who seemed to expect Him, in consequence of the tradition of their ancestors;
whereas those who had heard nothing at all of Him, both believe that He has come, and
hope that he is to come. And thus in all things prophecy appears faithful, which said that
He was the expectation of the Gentiles. The Jews, therefore, have erred concerning the first
coming of the Lord; and on this point only there is disagreement betwixt us and them. For
they themselves know and expect that Christ shall come; but that he has come already in
humility—even he who is called Jesus—they do not know. And this is a great confirmation
of His coming, that all do not believe on Him.”</p>

who have died before His coming?” Then Peter says: “You compel me, O Clement, to touch
upon things that are unspeakable. But so far as it is allowed to declare them, I shall not
shrink from doing so. Know then that Christ, who was from the beginning, and always,
was ever present with the pious, though secretly, through all their generations: especially
with those who waited for Him, to whom He frequently appeared. But the time was not yet
that there should be a resurrection of the bodies that were dissolved; but this seemed rather
to be their reward from God, that whoever should be found righteous, should remain longer
in the body; or, at least, as is clearly related in the writings of the law concerning a certain
righteous man, that God translated him.582 In like manner others were dealt with, who
pleased His will, that, being translated to Paradise, they should be kept for the kingdom.
But as to those who have not been able completely to fulfil the rule of righteousness, but
have had some remnants of evil in their flesh, their bodies are indeed dissolved, but their
souls are kept in good and blessed abodes, that at the resurrection of the dead, when they
shall recover their own bodies, purified even by the dissolution, they may obtain an eternal
inheritance in proportion to their good deeds. And therefore blessed are all those who shall
attain to the kingdom of Christ; for not only shall they escape the pains of hell, but shall
also remain incorruptible, and shall be the first to see God the Father, and shall obtain the
rank of honour among the first in the presence of God.”</p>

time was at hand, wrought various schisms among the people, that, if haply it might be
possible to abolish the former sin,583 the latter fault might be incorrigible. The first schism,
therefore, was that of those who were called Sadducees, which took their rise almost in the
time of John. These, as more righteous than others, began to separate themselves from the
assembly of the people, and to deny the resurrection of the dead,584 and to assert that by an
argument of infidelity, saying that it was unworthy that God should be worshipped, as it
were, under the promise of a reward. The first author of this opinion was Dositheus;585 the
second was Simon. Another schism is that of the Samaritans; for they deny the resurrection
of the dead, and assert that God is not to be worshipped in Jerusalem, but on Mount Gerizim.
They indeed rightly, from the predictions of Moses, expect the one true Prophet; but by the
wickedness of Dositheus they were hindered from believing that Jesus is He whom they
were expecting. The scribes also, and Pharisees, are led away into another schism; but these,
being baptized by John, and holding the word of truth received from the tradition of Moses
as the key of the kingdom of heaven, have hid it from the hearing of the people.586 Yea,
some even of the disciples of John, who seemed to be great ones, have separated themselves
from the people, and proclaimed their own master as the Christ. But all these schisms have

steps together with our faithful brethren, the people kept perfect silence; and first the high
priest began to exhort the people that they should hear patiently and quietly, and at the
same time witness and judge of those things that were to be spoken. Then, in the next place,
exalting with many praises the rite or sacrifice which had been bestowed by God upon the
human race for the remission of sins, he found fault with the baptism of our Jesus, as having

that neither are the dead to rise, nor is that worship of God to be maintained which is in
Jerusalem, but that Mount Gerizim is to be reverenced, added also this in opposition to us,
that our Jesus was not He whom Moses foretold as a Prophet to come into the world. Against
him, and another who supported him in what he said, James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
strove vigorously; and although they had a command not to enter into their cities,588 nor
to bring the word of preaching to them, yet, lest their discourse, unless it were confined,
should hurt the faith of others, they replied so prudently and so powerfully, that they put
them to perpetual silence. For James made an oration concerning the resurrection of the
dead, with the approbation of all the people; while John showed that if they would abandon
the error of Mount Gerizim, they should consequently acknowledge that Jesus was indeed
He who, according to the prophecy of Moses, was expected to come; since, indeed, as Moses
wrought signs and miracles, so also did Jesus. And there is no doubt but that the likeness
of the signs proves Him to be that prophet of whom he said that He should come, ‘like
himself.’ Having declared these things, and more to the same effect, they ceased.”</p>

<p>“And, behold, one of the scribes, shouting out from the midst of the people, says: ‘The
signs and miracles which your Jesus wrought, he wrought not as a prophet, but as a magician.’
Him Philip eagerly encounters, showing that by this argument he accused Moses
also. For when Moses wrought signs and miracles in Egypt, in like manner as Jesus also did
in Judæa, it cannot be doubted that what was said of Jesus might as well be said of Moses.
Having made these and such like protestations, Philip was silent.”</p>

<head>Chapter LIX.—Pharisees Refuted.</head>
<p>“Then a certain Pharisee, hearing this, chid Philip because he put Jesus on a level with
Moses. To whom Bartholomew, answering, boldly declared that we do not only say that
Jesus was equal to Moses, but that He was greater than he, because Moses was indeed a
prophet, as Jesus was also, but that Moses was not the Christ, as Jesus was, and therefore
He is doubtless greater who is both a prophet and the Christ, than he who is only a prophet.
After following out this train of argument, he stopped. After him James the son of Alphæus
gave an address to the people, with the view of showing that we are not to believe on Jesus
on the ground that the prophets foretold concerning Him, but rather that we are to believe
the prophets, that they were really prophets, because the Christ bears testimony to them;
for it is the presence and coming of Christ that show that they are truly prophets: for testimony
must be borne by the superior to his inferiors, not by the inferiors to their superior.
After these and many similar statements, James also was silent. After him Lebbæus began
vehemently to charge it upon the people that they did not believe in Jesus, who had done
them so much good by teaching them the things that are of God, by comforting the afflicted,
healing the sick, relieving the poor; yet for all these benefits their return had been hatred
and death. When he had declared these and many more such things to the people, he
ceased.”</p>

<head>Chapter LX.—Disciples of John Refuted.</head>
<p>“And, behold, one of the disciples of John asserted that John was the Christ, and not
Jesus, inasmuch as Jesus Himself declared that John was greater than all men and all
prophets.589 ‘If, then,’ said he, ‘he be greater than all, he must be held to be greater than
Moses, and than Jesus himself. But if he be the greatest of all, then must he be the Christ.’
To this Simon the Canaanite, answering, asserted that John was indeed greater than all the
prophets, and all who are born of women, yet that he is not greater than the Son of man.
Accordingly Jesus is also the Christ, whereas John is only a prophet: and there is as much
difference between him and Jesus, as between the forerunner and Him whose forerunner
he is; or as between Him who gives the law, and him who keeps the law. Having made these
and similar statements, the Canaanite also was silent. After him Barnabas,590 who also is
called Matthias, who was substituted as an apostle in the place of Judas, began to exhort the
people that they should not regard Jesus with hatred, nor speak evil of Him. For it were far
more proper, even for one who might be in ignorance or in doubt concerning Jesus, to love
than to hate Him. For God has affixed a reward to love, a penalty to hatred. ‘For the very
fact,’ said he, ‘that He assumed a Jewish body, and was born among the Jews, how has not
this incited us all to love Him?’ When he had spoken this, and more to the same effect, he
stopped.”</p>

the chief gift in an earthly inheritance; and promised that those who maintain righteousness
shall be satisfied with meat and drink; and many things of this sort He is charged with
teaching. Thomas, in reply, proves that his accusation is frivolous; showing that the
prophets, in whom Caiaphas believes, taught these things much more, and did not show in
what manner these things are to be, or how they are to be understood; whereas Jesus pointed
out how they are to be taken. And when he had spoken these things, and others of like kind,
Thomas also held his peace.”</p>

<p>“Therefore Caiaphas, again looking at me, and sometimes in the way of warning and
sometimes in that of accusation, said that I ought for the future to refrain from preaching
Christ Jesus, lest I should do it to my own destruction, and lest, being deceived myself, I
should also deceive others. Then, moreover, he charged me with presumption, because,
though I was unlearned, a fisherman, and a rustic, I dared to assume the office of a teacher.
As he spoke these things, and many more of like kind, I said in reply, that I incurred less
danger, if, as he said, this Jesus were not the Christ, because I received Him as a teacher of
the law; but that he was in terrible danger if this be the very Christ, as assuredly He is: for
I believe in Him who has appeared; but for whom else, who has never appeared, does he
reserve his faith? But if I, an unlearned and uneducated man, as you say, a fisherman and
a rustic, have more understanding than wise elders, this, said I, ought the more to strike
terror into you. For if I disputed with any learning, and won over you wise and learned
men, it would appear that I had acquired this power by long learning, and not by the grace
of divine power; but now, when, as I have said, we unskilled men convince and overcome

we entered into their cities, but disputed with them in public); the scribes and Pharisees,
concerning the kingdom of heaven; the disciples of John, that they should not suffer John
to be a stumbling-block to them; and all the people, that Jesus is the eternal Christ. At last,
however, I warned them, that before we should go forth to the Gentiles, to preach to them
the knowledge of God the Father, they should themselves be reconciled to God, receiving
His Son; for I showed them that in no way else could they be saved, unless through the grace
of the Holy Spirit they hasted to be washed with the baptism of threefold invocation, and
received the Eucharist of Christ the Lord, whom alone they ought to believe concerning
those things which He taught, that so they might merit to attain eternal salvation; but that
otherwise it was utterly impossible for them to be reconciled to God, even if they should
kindle a thousand altars and a thousand high altars to Him.”</p>

Almighty God, that the discourse of the approaching disputation might show the unquestionable
truth of our faith. Therefore, on the following day, James the bishop went up to
the temple with us, and with the whole church. There we found a great multitude, who had
been waiting for us from the middle of the night. Therefore we took our stand in the same
place as before, in order that, standing on an elevation, we might be seen by all the people.
Then, when profound silence was obtained, Gamaliel, who, as we have said, was of our faith,
but who by a dispensation remained amongst them, that if at any time they should attempt
anything unjust or wicked against us, he might either check them by skillfully adopted
counsel, or might warn us, that we might either be on our guard or might turn it aside;—he

<head>Chapter LXVII.—Speech of Gamaliel.</head>
<p>“‘If I, Gamaliel, deem it no reproach either to my learning or to my old age to learn
something from babes and unlearned ones, if haply there be anything which it is for profit
or for safety to acquire (for he who lives reasonably knows that nothing is more precious
than the soul), ought not this to be the object of love and desire to all, to learn what they do
not know, and to teach what they have learned? For it is most certain that neither friendship,
nor kindred, nor lofty power, ought to be more precious to men than truth. Therefore you,
O brethren, if ye know anything more, shrink not from laying it before the people of God
who are present, and also before your brethren; while the whole people shall willingly and
in perfect quietness hear what you say. For why should not the people do this, when they
see even me equally with themselves willing to learn from you, if haply God has revealed
something further to you? But if you in anything are deficient, be not ye ashamed in like
manner to be taught by us, that God may fill up whatever is wanting on either side. But if
any fear now agitates you on account of some of our people whose minds are prejudiced
against you, and if through fear of their violence you dare not openly speak your sentiments,
in order that I may deliver you from this fear, I openly swear to you by Almighty God, who
liveth for ever, that I will suffer no one to lay hands upon you. Since, then, you have all this

<head>Chapter LXVIII.—The Rule of Faith.</head>
<p>“These sayings of Gamaliel did not much please Caiaphas; and holding him in suspicion,
as it seemed, he began to insinuate himself cunningly into the discussions: for, smiling at
what Gamaliel had said, the chief of the priests asked of James, the chief of the bishops,594
that the discourse concerning Christ should not be drawn but from the Scriptures; ‘that we
may know,’ said he, ‘whether Jesus be the very Christ or no.’ Then said James, ‘We must
first inquire from what Scriptures we are especially to derive our discussion.’ Then he, with
difficulty, at length overcome by reason, answered, that it must be derived from the law;

<head>Chapter LXIX.—Two Comings of Christ.</head>
<p>“To him our James began to show, that whatsoever things the prophets say they have
taken from the law, and what they have spoken is in accordance with the law. He also made
some statements respecting the books of the Kings, in what way, and when, and by whom
they were written, and how they ought to be used. And when he had discussed most fully
concerning the law, and had, by a most clear exposition, brought into light whatever things
are in it concerning Christ, he showed by most abundant proofs that Jesus is the Christ, and
that in Him are fulfilled all the prophecies which related to His humble advent. For he
showed that two advents of Him are foretold: one in humiliation, which He has accomplished;
the other in glory, which is hoped for to be accomplished, when He shall come to
give the kingdom to those who believe in Him, and who observe all things which He has
commanded. And when he had plainly taught the people concerning these things, he added
this also: That unless a man be baptized in water, in the name of the threefold blessedness,
as the true Prophet taught, he can neither receive remission of sins nor enter into the kingdom
of heaven; and he declared that this is the prescription of the unbegotten God. To which
he added this also: ‘Do not think that we speak of two unbegotten Gods, or that one is divided
into two, or that the same is made male and female. But we speak of the only-begotten Son
of God, not sprung from another source, but ineffably self-originated; and in like manner
we speak of the Paraclete.’595 But when he had spoken some things also concerning baptism,
through seven successive days he persuaded all the people and the high priest that they
should hasten straightway to receive baptism.”</p>

<p>“And when matters were at that point that they should come and be baptized, some one

mean ye, O men of Israel? Why are you so easily hurried on? Why are ye led headlong by
most miserable men, who are deceived by Simon, a magician?’ While he was thus speaking,
and adding more to the same effect, and while James the bishop was refuting him, he began
to excite the people and to raise a tumult, so that the people might not be able to hear what
was said. Therefore he began to drive all into confusion with shouting, and to undo what
had been arranged with much labour, and at the same time to reproach the priests, and to
enrage them with revilings and abuse, and, like a madman, to excite every one to murder,
saying, ‘What do ye? Why do ye hesitate? Oh sluggish and inert, why do we not lay hands
upon them, and pull all these fellows to pieces?’ When he had said this, he first, seizing a
strong brand from the altar, set the example of smiting. Then others also, seeing him, were
carried away with like readiness. Then ensued a tumult on either side, of the beating and
the beaten. Much blood is shed; there is a confused flight, in the midst of which that enemy
attacked James, and threw him headlong from the top of the steps; and supposing him to

Then before daylight we went down to Jericho, to the number of 5000 men. Then after

chief priest, that he should arrest all who believed in Jesus, and should go to Damascus with
his letters, and that there also, employing the help of the unbelievers, he should make havoc

he believed that Peter had fled thither.597 And about thirty days thereafter he stopped on
his way while passing through Jericho going to Damascus. At that time we were absent,

power of the high God, which is superior to the Creator of the world; at the same time that
he showed many miracles, and made some doubt, and others fall away to him. He informed
me of all things that had been ascertained respecting this man from those who had formerly
been either his associates or his disciples, and had afterwards been converted to Zacchæus.
‘Many therefore there are, O Peter,’ said James, ‘for whose safety’s sake it behoves you to
go and to refute the magician, and to teach the word of truth. Therefore make no delay;
nor let it grieve you that you set out alone, knowing that God by Jesus will go with you, and
will help you, and that soon, by His grace, you will have many associates and sympathizers.

<head>Chapter I.—Power of Habit.</head>
<p>When the day dawned which had been fixed for the discussion with Simon, Peter, rising
at the first cock-crowing, aroused us also: for we were sleeping in the same apartment,
thirteen of us in all;600 of whom, next to Peter, Zacchæus was first, then Sophonius, Joseph
and Michæas, Eliesdrus, Phineas, Lazarus, and Elisæus: after these I (Clement) and
Nicodemus; then Niceta and Aquila, who had formerly been disciples of Simon, and were
converted to the faith of Christ under the teaching of Zacchæus. Of the women there was
no one present. As the evening light601 was still lasting, we all sat down; and Peter, seeing
that we were awake, and that we were giving attention to him, having saluted us, immediately
began to speak, as follows:—</p>
<p>“I confess, brethren, that I wonder at the power of human nature, which I see to be fit
and suited to every call upon it. This, however, it occurs to me to say of what I have found
by experience, that when the middle of the night is passed, I awake of my own accord, and
sleep does not come to me again. This happens to me for this reason, that I have formed
the habit of recalling to memory the words of my Lord, which I heard from Himself; and
for the longing I have towards them, I constrain my mind and my thoughts to be roused,
that, awaking to them, and recalling and arranging them one by one, I may retain them in
my memory. From this, therefore, whilst I desire to cherish the sayings of the Lord with all
delight in my heart, the habit of waking has come upon me, even if there be nothing that I
wish to think of. Thus, in some unaccountable way, when any custom is established, the
old custom is changed, provided indeed you do not force it above measure, but as far as the
measure of nature admits. For it is not possible to be altogether without sleep; otherwise
night would not have been made for rest.”</p>

<p>Then I, when I heard this, said: “You have very well said, O Peter; for one custom is

was disordered, so that I felt as if I had been beaten, and could not bear the tossing and tumult
of the sea; but after a few days, when I had got accustomed to it, I began to bear it tolerably,
so that I was glad to take food immediately in the morning along with the sailors, whereas
before it was not my custom to eat anything before the seventh hour. Now, therefore, simply
from the custom which I then acquired, hunger reminds me about that time at which I used
to eat with the sailors; which, however, I hope to get rid of, when once another custom shall
have been formed. I believe, therefore, that you also have acquired the habit of wakefulness,
as you state; and you have wished at a fitting time to explain this to us, that we also may not
grudge to throw off and dispense with some portion of our sleep, that we may be able to
take in the precepts of the living doctrine. For when the food is digested, and the mind is

<p>Then Peter, being pleased to hear that I understood the purport of his preface, that he
had delivered it for our advantage; and commending me, doubtless for the purpose of encouraging,
and stimulating me, began to deliver the following discourse:602 “It seems to
me to be seasonable and necessary to have some discussion relating to those things that are
near at hand; that is, concerning Simon. For I should wish to know of what character and
of what conduct he is. Wherefore, if any one of you has any knowledge of him, let him not
fail to inform me; for it is of consequence to know these things beforehand. For if we have
it in charge, that when we enter into a city we should first learn who in it is worthy,603 that

<p>“But for other reasons also it is of importance that I should have some knowledge of
this man. For if I know that in those things concerning which it cannot be doubted that
they are good, he is faultless and irreproachable,—that is to say, if he is sober, merciful, upright,
gentle, and humane, which no one doubts to be good qualities,—then it will seem to
be fitting, that upon him who possesses these good virtues, that which is lacking of faith
and knowledge should be conferred; and so his life, which is in other respects worthy of
approbation, should be amended in those points in which it shall appear to be imperfect.
But if he remains wrapped up and polluted in those sins which are manifestly such, it does
not become me to speak to him at all of the more secret and sacred things of divine knowledge,
but rather to protest and confront him, that he cease from sin, and cleanse his actions
from vice. But if he insinuate himself, and lead us on to speak what he, while he acts improperly,
ought not to hear, it will be our part to parry him cautiously. For not to answer him
at all does not seem proper, for the sake of the hearers, lest haply they may think that we
decline the contest through want of ability to answer him, and so their faith may be injured

<head>Chapter V.—Simon Magus, a Formidable Antagonist.</head>
<p>When Peter had thus spoken to us, Niceta asks permission to say something to him;605
and Peter having granted permission, he says: “With your pardon, I beseech you, my lord
Peter, to hear me, who am very anxious for thee, and who am afraid lest, in the contest which
you have in hand with Simon, you should seem to be overmatched. For it very frequently
happens that he who defends the truth does not gain the victory, since the hearers are either
prejudiced, or have no great interest in the better cause. But over and above all this, Simon
himself is a most vehement orator, trained in the dialectic art, and in the meshes of syllogisms;
and what is worse than all, he is greatly skilled in the magic art. And therefore I fear, lest
haply, being so strongly fortified on every side, he shall be thought to be defending the truth,
whilst he is alleging falsehoods, in the presence of those who do not know him. For neither
should we ourselves have been able to escape from him, and to be converted to the Lord,
had it not been that, while we were his assistants, and the sharers of his errors, we had ascertained
that he was a deceiver and a magician.”</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Simon Magus: His Wickedness.</head>
<p>When Niceta had thus spoken, Aquila also, asking that he might be permitted to speak,
proceeded in manner following: “Receive, I entreat thee, most excellent Peter, the assurance
of my love towards thee; for indeed I also am extremely anxious on thy account. And do
not blame us in this, for indeed to be concerned for any one cometh of affection; whereas
to be indifferent is no less than hatred. But I call God to witness that I feel for thee, not as
knowing thee to be weaker in debate,—for indeed I was never present at any dispute in
which thou wert engaged,—but because I well know the impieties of this man, I think of
thy reputation, and at the same time the souls of the hearers, and above all, the interests of
the truth itself. For this magician is vehement towards all things that he wishes, and wicked
above measure. For in all things we know him well, since from boyhood we have been assistants
and ministers of his wickedness; and had not the love of God rescued us from him,
we should even now be engaged in the same evil deeds with him. But a certain inborn love
towards God rendered his wickedness hateful to us, and the worship of God attractive to
us. Whence I think also that it was the work of Divine Providence, that we, being first made
his associates, should take knowledge in what manner or by what art he effects the prodigies
which he seems to work. For who is there that would not be astonished at the wonderful
things which he does? Who would not think that he was a god come down from heaven
for the salvation of men? For myself, I confess, if I had not known him intimately, and had
taken part in his doings, I would easily have been carried away with him. Whence it was
no great thing for us to be separated from his society, knowing as we did that he depends
upon magic arts and wicked devices. But if thou also thyself wish to know all about
him—who, what, and whence he is, and how he contrives what he does—then listen.”</p>

himself to be believed to be an exalted power, which is above God the Creator, and to be

had broached his heresy,606 with thirty other chief disciples, and one woman, who was called
Luna607—whence also these thirty appear to have been appointed with reference to the
number of the days, according to the course of the moon—this Simon ambitious of evil
glory, as we have said, goes to Dositheus, and pretending friendship, entreats him, that if
any one of those thirty should die, he should straightway substitute him in room of the
dead: for it was contrary to their rule either to exceed the fixed number, or to admit any
one who was unknown, or not yet proved; whence also the rest, desiring to become worthy
of the place and number, are eager in every way to please, according to the institutions of
their sect each one of those who aspire after admittance into the number, hoping that he
may be deemed worthy to be put into the place of the deceased, when, as we have said, any

<p>“But not long after he fell in love with that woman whom they call Luna; and he confided
all things to us as his friends: how he was a magician, and how he loved Luna, and how,
being desirous of glory, he was unwilling to enjoy her ingloriously, but that he was waiting
patiently till he could enjoy her honourably; yet so if we also would conspire with him towards
the accomplishment of his desires. And he promised that, as a reward of this service, he
would cause us to be invested with the highest honours, and we should be believed by men
to be gods; ‘Only, however, on condition,’ says he, ‘that you confer the chief place upon me,
Simon, who by magic art am able to show many signs and prodigies, by means of which
either my glory or our sect may be established. For I am able to render myself invisible to
those who wish to lay hold of me, and again to be visible when I am willing to be seen.608
If I wish to flee, I can dig through the mountains, and pass through rocks as if they were
clay. If I should throw myself headlong from a lofty mountain, I should be borne unhurt
to the earth, as if I were held up; when bound, I can loose myself, and bind those who had
bound me; being shut up in prison, I can make the barriers open of their own accord; I can
render statues animated, so that those who see suppose that they are men. I can make new
trees suddenly spring up, and produce sprouts at once. I can throw myself into the fire, and
not be burnt; I can change my countenance, so that I cannot be recognised; but I can show
people that I have two faces. I shall change myself into a sheep or a goat; I shall make a
beard to grow upon little boys; I shall ascend by flight into the air; I shall exhibit abundance
of gold, and shall make and unmake kings. I shall be worshipped as God; I shall have divine
honours publicly assigned to me, so that an image of me shall be set up, and I shall be worshipped
and adored as God. And what need of more words? Whatever I wish, that I shall
be able to do. For already I have achieved many things by way of experiment. In short,’
says he, ‘once when my mother Rachel ordered me to go to the field to reap, and I saw a
sickle lying, I ordered it to go and reap; and it reaped ten times more than the others. Lately,
I produced many new sprouts from the earth, and made them bear leaves and produce fruit
in a moment; and the nearest mountain I successfully bored through.’”</p>

Dositheus, he began to depreciate Dositheus himself, saying that he did not teach purely or
perfectly, and that this was the result not of ill intention, but of ignorance. But Dositheus,
when he perceived that Simon was depreciating him, fearing lest his reputation among men
might be obscured (for he himself was supposed to be the Standing One), moved with rage,
when they met as usual at the school, seized a rod, and began to beat Simon; but suddenly
the rod seemed to pass through his body, as if it had been smoke. On which Dositheus,
being astonished, says to him, ‘Tell me if thou art the Standing One, that I may adore thee.’
And when Simon answered that he was, then Dositheus, perceiving that he himself was not
the Standing One, fell down and worshipped him, and gave up his own place as chief to Simon,
ordering all the rank of thirty men to obey him; himself taking the inferior place which
Simon formerly occupied. Not long after this he died.”</p>

power which is above God the Creator, while Luna, who is with him, has been brought down
from the higher heavens, and that she is Wisdom, the mother of all things, for whom, says
he, the Greeks and barbarians contending, were able in some measure to see an image of
her; but of herself, as she is, as the dweller with the first and only God, they were wholly ignorant.
Propounding these and other things of the same sort, he has deceived many. But
I ought also to state this, which I remember that I myself saw. Once, when this Luna of his

the tower on all sides; but she was seen by all the people to lean forward, and to look out

<head>Chapter XIII.—Simon Magus: Secret of His Magic.</head>
<p>“Now when Niceta and I once asked him to explain to us how these things could be effected
by magic art, and what was the nature of that thing, Simon began thus to explain it
to us as his associates. ‘I have,’ said he, ‘made the soul of a boy, unsullied and violently slain,
and invoked by unutterable adjurations, to assist me; and by it all is done that I command.’
‘But,’ said I, ‘is it possible for a soul to do these things?’ He answered: ‘I would have you
know this, that the soul of man holds the next place after God, when once it is set free from
the darkness of his body. And immediately it acquires prescience: wherefore it is invoked
for necromancy.’ Then I answered: ‘Why, then, do not the souls of persons who are slain
take vengeance on their slayers?’ ‘Do you not remember,’ said he, ‘that I told you, that when
it goes out of the body it acquires knowledge of the future?’ ‘I remember,’ said I. ‘Well,
then,’ said he, ‘as soon as it goes out of the body, it immediately knows that there is a judgment
to come, and that every one shall suffer punishment for those evils that he hath done;
and therefore they are unwilling to take vengeance on their slayers, because they themselves
are enduring torments for their own evil deeds which they had done here, and they know
that severer punishments await them in the judgment. Moreover, they are not permitted
by the angels who preside over them to go out, or to do anything.’ ‘Then,’ I replied, ‘if the
angels do not permit them to come hither, or to do what they please, how can the souls obey
the magician who invokes them?’ ‘It is not,’ said he, ‘that they grant indulgence to the souls
that are willing to come: but when the presiding angels are adjured by one greater than
themselves, they have the excuse of our violence who adjure them, to permit the souls which
we invoke to go out: for they do not sin who suffer violence, but we who impose necessity
upon them.’ Thereupon Niceta, not able longer to refrain, hastily answered, as indeed I also
was about to do, only I wished first to get information from him on several points; but, as
I said, Niceta, anticipating me, said: ‘And do you not fear the day of judgment, who do violence
to angels, and invoke souls, and deceive men, and bargain for divine honour to
yourself from men? And how do you persuade us that there shall be no judgment, as some
of the Jews confess, and that souls are not immortal, as many suppose, though you see them
with your very eyes, and receive from them assurance of the divine judgment?’”</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Simon Magus, Professes to Be God.</head>
<p>“At those sayings of his Simon grew pale; but after a little, recollecting himself, he thus
answered: ‘Do not think that I am a man of your race. I am neither magician, nor lover of
Luna, nor son of Antonius. For before my mother Rachel and he came together, she, still
a virgin, conceived me, while it was in my power to be either small or great, and to appear
as a man among men.610 Therefore I have chosen you first as my friends, for the purpose
of trying you, that I may place you first in my heavenly and unspeakable places when I shall
have proved you. Therefore I have pretended to be a man, that I might more clearly ascertain
if you cherish entire affection towards me.’ But when I heard that, judging him indeed to
be a wretch, yet wondering at his impudence; and blushing for him, and at the same time
fearing lest he should attempt some evil against us, I beckoned to Niceta to feign for a little
along with me, and said to him: ‘Be not angry with us, corruptible men, O thou incorruptible
God, but rather accept our affection, and our mind willing to know who God is; for we did
not till now know who thou art, nor did we perceive that thou art he whom we were seeking.’”</p>

fellow believed that we were deceived; and being thereby the more elated, he added also
this: ‘I shall now be propitious to you, for the affection which you bear towards me as God;
for you loved me while you did not know me, and were seeking me in ignorance. But I
would not have you doubt that this is truly to be God, when one is able to become small or
great as he pleases; for I am able to appear to man in whatever manner I please. Now, then,
I shall begin to unfold to you what is true. Once on a time, I, by my power, turning air into
water, and water again into blood, and solidifying it into flesh, formed a new human
creature—a boy—and produced a much nobler work than God the Creator. For He created
a man from the earth, but I from air—a far more difficult matter; and again I unmade him
and restored him to air, but not until I had placed his picture and image in my bed-chamber,
as a proof and memorial of my work.’ Then we understood that he spake concerning that
boy, whose soul, after he had been slain by violence, he made use of for those services which
he required.”</p>

<p>But Peter, hearing these things, said with tears:611 “Greatly do I wonder at the infinite
patience of God, and, on the other hand, at the audacity of human rashness in some. For
what further reason can be found to persuade Simon that God judges the unrighteous, since
he persuades himself that he employs the obedience of souls for the service of his crimes?
But, in truth, he is deluded by demons. Yet, although he is sure by these very things that
souls are immortal, and are judged for the deeds which they have done, and although he
thinks that he really sees those things which we believe by faith; though, as I said, he is deluded
by demons, yet he thinks that he sees the very substance of the soul. How shall such
a man, I say, be brought to confess either that he acts wickedly while he occupies such an
evil position, or that he is to be judged for those things which he hath done, who, knowing
the judgment of God, despises it, and shows himself an enemy to God, and dares commit
such horrid things? Wherefore it is certain, my brethren, that some oppose the truth and
religion of God, not because it appears to them that reason can by no means stand with
faith, but because they are either involved in excess of wickedness, or prevented by their
own evils, or elated by the swelling of their heart, so that they do not even believe those
things which they think that they see with their own eyes.”</p>

render them hostile and ungrateful to their Creator. For I call heaven and earth to witness,
that if God permitted the enemy to rage as much as he desires, all men should have perished
long ere now; but for His mercy’s sake God doth not suffer him. But if men would turn
their affection towards God, all would doubtless be saved, even if for some faults they might
seem to be corrected for righteousness. But now the most of men have been made enemies
of God, whose hearts the wicked one has entered, and has turned aside towards himself the
affection which God the Creator had implanted in them, that they might have it towards
Him. But of the rest, who seemed for a time to be watchful, the enemy, appearing in a

<p>“To this Aquila answered: “How, then, are men in fault, if the wicked one, transforming
himself into the brightness of light,612 promises to men greater things than the Creator
Himself does?” Then Peter answered: “I think,” says he “that nothing is more unjust than
this; and now listen while I tell you how unjust it is. If your son, whom you have trained
and nourished with all care, and brought to man’s estate, should be ungrateful to you, and
should leave you and go to another, whom perhaps he may have seen to be richer, and
should show to him the honour which he owed to you, and, through hope of greater profit,
should deny his birth, and refuse you your paternal rights, would this seem to you right or
wicked?” Then Aquila answered: “It is manifest to all that it would be wicked.” Then Peter
said: “If you say that this would be wicked among men, how much more so is it in the case
of God, who, above all men, is worthy of honour from men; whose benefits we not only
enjoy, but by whose means and power it is that we began to be when we were not, and whom,
if we please, we shall obtain from Him to be for ever in blessedness! In order, therefore,
that the unfaithful may be distinguished from the faithful, and the pious from the impious,
it has been permitted to the wicked one to use those arts by which the affections of every
one towards the true Father may be proved. But if there were in truth some strange God,
were it right to leave our own God, who created us, and who is our Father and our Maker,
and to pass over to another?” “God forbid!” said Aquila. Then said Peter: “How, then,
shall we say that the wicked one is the cause of our sin, when this is done by permission of
God, that those may be proved and condemned in the day of judgment, who, allured by
greater promises, have abandoned their duty towards their true Father and Creator; while
those who have kept the faith and the love of their own Father, even with poverty, if so it
has befallen, and with tribulation, may enjoy heavenly gifts and immortal dignities in His
kingdom. But we shall expound these things more carefully at another time. Meantime I

<p>And Niceta answered: “When he perceived that we had found him out, having spoken
to one another concerning his crimes, we left him, and came to Zacchæus, telling him those
same things which we have now told to you. But he, receiving us most kindly, and instructing
us concerning the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, enrolled us in the number of the faithful.”
When Niceta had done speaking, Zacchæus, who had gone out a little before, entered, saying,
“It is time, O Peter, that you proceed to the disputation; for a great crowd, collected in the
court of the house, is awaiting you, in the midst of whom stands Simon, supported by many
attendants.” Then Peter, when he heard this, ordering me to withdraw for the sake of
prayer (for I had not yet been washed from the sins which I had committed in ignorance),
said to the rest, “Brethren, let us pray that God, for His unspeakable mercy through His
Christ, would help me going out on behalf of the salvation of men who have been created
by Him.” Having said this, and having prayed, he went forth to the court of the house, in
which a great multitude of people were assembled; and when he saw them all looking intently
on him in profound silence, and Simon the magician standing in the midst of them like a
standard-bearer, he began in manner following.613</p>
<note type="footnote">613 [Three discussions with Simon Magus are detailed in the pseudo-Clementine literature,—one in the Recognitions,
ii. 20–iii. 48; two in the Homilies, iii. 30–58 and xvi.–xix. The differences between these are quite
remarkable. I. External Differences.—That in the Recognitions is assigned to Cæsarea and is represented as
lasting three days, details of each day’s discussion being given. The earlier one in the Homilies is given the same
place and time, but it is very brief. The details of the first day alone are mentioned; and it resembles that in the
Recognitions less than does the later one. This is represented as taking place at Laodicea, and as occupying four
days. The account is the longest of the three. In its historical setting this discussion has no parallel in the Recognitions.
Faustus, the father of Clement, is made the umpire; and this discussion before him takes the place of
the discussions with him which occupy so large a part of Recognitions, viii.–x. II. Internal Differences.—Of
course there are many thoughts common to the discussions; but the treatment is so varied as to form one of the
most perplexing points in the literary problem. All are somewhat irregular in arrangement, hence an analysis
is difficult. The discussion in the Recognitions seems to be more ethical and philosophical than those in the
Homilies; the latter contain more theosophical views. Both of them emphasize the falsehoods of Scripture and
abound more in sophistries and verbal sword-play. In the Recognitions against Simon’s polytheism and theory
of an unknown God, Peter opposes the righteousness of God, emphasizing the freedom of the will, discussing
the existence and origin of evil, reverting to the righteousness of God as proving the immortality of the soul.
The defeat of Simon is narrated in a peculiar way. The Cæsarean discussion in the Homilies is very briefly narrated.
After the preliminary parley, Simon attacks the God of the Scriptures attributing defects to Him. Peter’s reply,
while explaining many passages correctly, is largely taken up with a statement of the view of the Scripture peculiar
to the Homilies. This is really the weapon with which Simon is defeated. The discussion, therefore, presents
few points of resemblance to that in the Recognitions. The Laodicean discussion in the Homilies, covering four</note>

are obedient to it seem indeed themselves to confer some favour upon God; whereas
they do themselves obtain from Him the gift of His greatest bounty, walking in His paths
of righteousness. Wherefore the first duty of all is to inquire into the righteousness of God
and His kingdom;615 His righteousness, that we may be taught to act rightly; His kingdom,
that we may know what is the reward appointed for labour and patience; in which kingdom
there is indeed a bestowal of eternal good things upon the good, but upon those who have
acted contrary to the will of God, a worthy infliction of penalties in proportion to the doings
of every one. It becomes you, therefore, whilst you are here,—that is, whilst you are in the
present life,—to ascertain the will of God, while there is opportunity also of doing it. For
if any one, before he amends his doings, wishes to investigate concerning things which he
cannot discover, such investigation will be foolish and ineffectual. For the time is short,
and the judgment of God shall be occupied with deeds, not questions. Therefore before all
things let us inquire into this, what or in what manner we must act that we may merit to
obtain eternal life.</p>

opening argument is concerning polytheism. To Peter’s monotheism Simon opposes the contradictions of
Scripture: these Peter explains, including some christological statements which lead to a declaration of the
nature, name and character of God. On the second day, after some personal discussion, Simon asserts that
Christ’s teaching differs from that of Peter; the argument reverts to the shape and figure of God. The evidence
of the senses is urged against fancied revelations, which are attributed to demons. On the third day the question
of God the Framer of the world is introduced, and His moral character. Peter explains the nature of revelation,
with some sharp personal thrusts at Simon, but soon reverts to the usual explanation of Scripture. On the fourth
day the existence of the evil one becomes the prominent topic: the existence of sin is pressed; and the discussion
closes with a justification of the inequalities of human life, and an expression of judgment against Simon by
Faustus. Throughout these portions footnotes have been added, to indicate the correspondences of thought in

<head>Chapter XXI.—Righteousness the Way to the Kingdom.</head>
<p>“For if we occupy the short time of this life with vain and useless questions, we shall
without doubt go into the presence of God empty and void of good works, when, as I have
said, our works shall be brought into judgment. For everything has its own time and place.
This is the place, this the time of works; the world to come, that of recompenses. That we
may not therefore be entangled, by changing the order of places and times, let us inquire,
in the first place, what is the righteousness of God; so that, like persons going to set out on
a journey, we may be filled with good works as with abundant provision, so that we may be
able to come to the kingdom of God, as to a very great city. For to those who think aright,
God is manifest even by the operations of the world which He hath made, using the evidence
of His creation;616 and therefore, since there ought to be no doubt about God, we have now
to inquire only about His righteousness and His kingdom. But if our mind suggest to us to
make any inquiry concerning secret and hidden things before we inquire into the works of
righteousness, we ought to render to ourselves a reason, because if acting well we shall
merit to obtain salvation: then, going to God chaste and clean, we shall be filled with the
Holy Spirit, and shall know all things that are secret and hidden, without any cavilling of
questions; whereas now, even if any one should spend the whole of his life in inquiring into
these things, he not only shall not be able to find them, but shall involve himself in greater
errors, because he did not first enter through the way of righteousness, and strive to reach
the haven of life.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Righteousness; What It is.</head>
<p>“And therefore I advise that His righteousness be first inquired into, that, pursuing our
journey through it, and placed in the way of truth, we may be able to find the true Prophet,
running not with swiftness of foot, but with goodness of works, and that, enjoying His
guidance, we may be under no danger of mistaking the way. For if under His guidance we
shall merit to enter that city to which we desire to come, all things concerning which we
now inquire we shall see with our eyes, being made, as it were, heirs of all things. Understand,
therefore, that the way is this course of our life; the travellers are those who do good works;
the gate is the true Prophet, of whom we speak; the city is the kingdom in which dwells the
Almighty Father, whom only those can see who are of pure heart.617 Let us not then think
the labour of this journey hard, because at the end of it there shall be rest. For the true
Prophet Himself also from the beginning of the world, through the course of time, hastens
to rest. For He is present with us at all times; and if at any time it is necessary, He appears
and corrects us, that He may bring to eternal life those who obey Him. Therefore this is my
judgment, as also it is the pleasure of the true Prophet, that inquiry should first be made
concerning righteousness, by those especially who profess that they know God. If therefore
any one has anything to propose which he thinks better, let him speak; and when he has
spoken, let him hear, but with patience and quietness: for in order to this at the first, by
way of salutation, I prayed for peace to you all.”</p>

<p>To this Simon answered:618 “We have no need of your peace; for if there be peace and
concord, we shall not be able to make any advance towards the discovery of truth. For
robbers and debauchees have peace among themselves, and every wickedness agrees with
itself; and if we have met with this view, that for the sake of peace we should give assent to
all that is said, we shall confer no benefit upon the hearers; but, on the contrary, we shall
impose upon them, and shall depart friends. Wherefore, do not invoke peace, but rather
battle, which is the mother of peace; and if you can, exterminate errors. And do not seek
for friendship obtained by unfair admissions; for this I would have you know, above all,
that when two fight with each other, then there will be peace when one has been defeated
and has fallen. And therefore fight as best you can, and do not expect peace without war,
which is impossible; or if it can be attained, show us how.”</p>

<p>To this Peter answered: “Hear with all attention, O men, what we say. Let us suppose
that this world is a great plain, and that from two states, whose kings are at variance with
each other, two generals were sent to fight: and suppose the general of the good king gave
this counsel, that both armies should without bloodshed submit to the authority of the better
king, whereby all should be safe without danger; but that the opposite general should say,
No, but we must fight; that not he who is worthy, but who is stronger, may reign, with those
who shall escape;—which, I ask you, would you rather choose? I doubt not but that you
would give your hands to the better king, with the safety of all. And I do not now wish, as
Simon says that I do, that assent should be given, for the sake of peace, to those things that

<head>Chapter XXV.—Principles on Which the Discussion Should Be Conducted.</head>
<p>“For some, in the contest of disputations, when they perceive that their error is confuted,
immediately begin, for the sake of making good their retreat, to create a disturbance, and
to stir up strifes, that it may not be manifest to all that they are defeated; and therefore I
frequently entreat that the investigation of the matter in dispute may be conducted with all
patience and quietness, so that if perchance anything seem to be not rightly spoken, it may
be allowed to go back over it, and explain it more distinctly. For sometimes a thing may be
spoken in one way and heard in another, while it is either advanced too obscurely, or not
attended to with sufficient care; and on this account I desire that our conversation should
be conducted patiently, so that neither should the one snatch it away from the other, nor
should the unseasonable speech of one contradicting interrupt the speech of the other; and
that we should not cherish the desire of finding fault, but that we should be allowed, as I
have said, to go over again what has not been clearly enough spoken, that by fairest examination
the knowledge of the truth may become clearer. For we ought to know, that if any
one is conquered by the truth, it is not he that is conquered, but the ignorance which is in
him, which is the worst of all demons; so that he who can drive it out receives the palm of
salvation. For it is our purpose to benefit the hearers, not that we may conquer badly, but
that we may be well conquered for the acknowledgment of the truth. For if our speech be
actuated by the desire of seeking the truth, even although we shall speak anything imperfectly
through human frailty, God in His unspeakable goodness will fill up secretly in the understandings
of the hearers those things that are lacking. For He is righteous; and according
to the purpose of every one, He enables some to find easily what they seek, while to others
He renders even that obscure which is before their eyes. Since, then, the way of God is the
way of peace, let us with peace seek the things which are God’s. If any one has anything to
advance in answer to this, let him do so; but if there is no one who wishes to answer, I shall
begin to speak, and I myself shall bring forward what another may object to me, and shall
refute it.”</p>

may appear to the ignorant crowd to be speaking well; but I shall not allow you this subterfuge.
Now therefore, since you promise, as a brave man, to answer to all that any one chooses
to bring forward, be pleased to answer me in the first place.” Then Peter said: “I am ready,
only provided that our discussion may be with peace.” Then Simon said: “Do not you see,
O simpleton, that in pleading for peace you act in opposition to your Master, and that what
you propose is not suitable to him who promises that he will overthrow ignorance? Or, if
you are right in asking peace from the audience, then your Master was wrong in saying, ‘I
have not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.’619 For either you say well, and he not
well; or else, if your Master said well, then you not at all well: for you do not understand
that your statement is contrary to his, whose disciple you profess yourself to be.”</p>

rashly find fault with what you do not understand: for you have heard that the Master came
not to send peace on earth; but that He also said, ‘Blessed are the peace-makers, for they
shall be called the very sons of God,’620 you have not heard. Wherefore my sentiments are
not different from those of the Master when I recommend peace, to the keepers of which
He assigned blessedness.” Then Simon said: “In your desire to answer for your Master, O
Peter, you have brought a much more serious charge against him, if he himself came not to
make peace, yet enjoined upon others to keep it. Where, then, is the consistency of that
other saying of his, ‘it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master?’”621</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Consistency of Christ’s Teaching.</head>
<p>To this Peter answered: “Our Master, who was the true Prophet, and ever mindful of
Himself, neither contradicted Himself, nor enjoined upon us anything different from what
Himself practised. For whereas He said, ‘I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword;
and henceforth you shall see father separated from son, son from father, husband from wife
and wife from husband, mother from daughter and daughter from mother, brother from
brother, father-in-law from daughter-in-law, friend from friend,’ all these contain the doctrine
of peace; and I will tell you how. At the beginning of His preaching, as wishing to invite
and lead all to salvation, and induce them to bear patiently labours and trials, He blessed
the poor, and promised that they should obtain the kingdom of heaven for their endurance
of poverty, in order that under the influence of such a hope they might bear with equanimity
the weight of poverty, despising covetousness; for covetousness is one, and the greatest, of
most pernicious sins. But He promised also that the hungry and the thirsty should be satisfied
with the eternal blessings of righteousness, in order that they might bear poverty patiently,
and not be led by it to undertake any unrighteous work. In like manner, also, He said that
the pure in heart are blessed, and that thereby they should see God, in order that every one
desiring so great a good might keep himself from evil and polluted thoughts.”</p>

<pb n="243"/>
<head>Chapter XXIX.—Peace and Strife.</head>
<p>“Thus, therefore, our Master, inviting His disciples to patience, impressed upon them
that the blessing of peace was also to be preserved with the labour of patience. But, on the
other hand, He mourned over those who lived in riches and luxury, who bestowed nothing
upon the poor; proving that they must render an account, because they did not pity their
neighbours, even when they were in poverty, whom they ought to love as themselves. And
by such sayings as these He brought some indeed to obey Him, but others He rendered
hostile. The believers therefore, and the obedient, He charges to have peace among themselves.
and says to them, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the very sons
of God.’622 But to those who not only did not believe, but set themselves in opposition to
His doctrine, He proclaims the war of the word and of confutation, and says that ‘henceforth
ye shall see son separated from father, and husband from wife, and daughter from mother,
and brother from brother, and daughter-in-law from mother-in-law, and a man’s foes shall
be they of his own house.’623 For in every house, when there begins to be a difference betwixt
believer and unbeliever, there is necessarily a contest: the unbelievers, on the one hand,
fighting against the faith; and the believers on the other, confuting the old error and the
vices of sins in them.”</p>

scribes and Pharisees, charging them with evil deeds and unsound doctrine, and with hiding
the key of knowledge which they had handed down to them from Moses, by which the gate
of the heavenly kingdom might be opened.624 But when our Master sent us forth to preach,
He commanded us, that into whatsoever city or house we should enter, we should say, ‘Peace
be to this house.’ ‘And if,’ said He, ‘a son of peace be there, your peace shall come upon
him; but if there be not, your peace shall return to you.’ Also that, going out from that house
or city, we should shake off upon them the very dust which adhered to our feet. ‘But it shall
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for
that city or house.’625 This indeed He commanded to be done at length, if first the word of
truth be preached in the city or house, whereby they who receive the faith of the truth may
become sons of peace and sons of God; and those who will not receive it may be convicted
as enemies of peace and of God.”</p>

the war of the word, and to rebuke him sharply by confuting his ignorance and charging
home upon him his sins. Therefore of necessity we offer peace, that if any one is a son of
peace, our peace may come upon him; but from him who makes himself an enemy of peace,
our peace shall return to ourselves. We do not therefore, as you say, propose peace by
agreement with the wicked, for indeed we should straightway have given you the right hand;
but only in order that, through our discussing quietly and patiently, it might be more easily
ascertained by the hearers which is the true speech. But if you differ and disagree with
yourself, how shall you stand? He must of necessity fall who is divided in himself; ‘for every
kingdom divided against itself shall not stand.’626 If you have aught to say to this, say on.”</p>

or every city divided in itself shall not stand; and elsewhere you say, that he said that he
would send a sword, that he might separate those who are in one house, so that son shall
be divided from father, daughter from mother, brother from brother; so that if there be five

not understand. In the first place, I shall answer your assertion, that I set forth the words
of my Master, and from them resolve matters about which there is still doubt. Our Lord,
when He sent us apostles to preach, enjoined us to teach all nations628 the things which
were committed to us. We cannot therefore speak those things as they were spoken by
Himself. For our commission is not to speak, but to teach those things, and from them to
show how every one of them rests upon truth. Nor, again, are we permitted to speak anything
of our own. For we are sent; and of necessity he who is sent delivers the message as he has
been ordered, and sets forth the will of the sender. For if I should speak anything different
from what He who sent me enjoined me, I should be a false apostle, not saying what I am
commanded to say, but what seems good to myself. Whoever does this, evidently wishes
to show himself to be better than he is by whom he is sent, and without doubt is a traitor.
If, on the contrary, he keeps by the things that he is commanded, and brings forward most
clear assertions of them, it will appear that he is accomplishing the work of an apostle; and
it is by striving to fulfil this that I displease you. Blame me not, therefore, because I bring
forward the words of Him who sent me. But if there is aught in them that is not fairly
spoken, you have liberty to confute me; but this can in no wise be done, for He is a prophet,
and cannot be contrary to Himself. But if you do not think that He is a prophet, let this be
first inquired into.”</p>

<p>Then said Simon: “I have no need to learn this from you, but how these things agree
with one another. For if he shall be shown to be inconsistent, he shall be proved at the same
time not to be a prophet.” Then says Peter: “But if I first show Him to be a prophet, it will
follow that what seems to be inconsistency is not such. For no one can be proved to be a
prophet merely by consistency, because it is possible for many to attain this; but if consistency
does not make a prophet, much more inconsistency does not. Because, therefore, there are
many things which to some seem inconsistent, which yet have consistency in them on a
more profound investigation; as also other things which seem to have consistency, but
which, being more carefully discussed, are found to be inconsistent; for this reason I do not
think there is any better way to judge of these things than to ascertain in the first instance
whether He be a prophet who has spoken those things which appear to be inconsistent. For
it is evident that, if He be found a prophet, those things which seem to be contradictory
must have consistency, but are misunderstood. Concerning these things, therefore, proofs
will be properly demanded. For we apostles are sent to expound the sayings and affirm the
judgments of Him who has sent us; but we are not commissioned to say anything of our
own, but to unfold the truth, as I have said, of His words.”</p>

or to have come for the salvation of men.” Then Peter said: “I will tell you how our Master
said that every kingdom and every house divided against itself cannot stand; and whereas
He Himself did this, see how it makes for salvation. By the word of truth He certainly divides
the kingdom of the world, which is founded in error, and every home in it, that error may
fall, and truth may reign. But if it happen to any house, that error, being introduced by any
one, divides the truth, then, where error has gained a footing, it is certain that truth cannot
stand.” Then Simon said: “But it is uncertain whether your master divides error or truth.”
Then Peter: “That belongs to another question; but if you are agreed that everything which
is divided falls, it remains that I show, if only you will hear in peace, that our Jesus has divided
and dispelled error by teaching truth.”</p>

disputes spring from sins; and where there is no sin, there is peace of soul; but where there
is peace, truth is found in disputations, righteousness in works.” Then Simon: “You seem

<p>Then Simon said: “I shall make use of assertions from the law of the Jews only. For it
is manifest to all who take interest in religion, that this law is of universal authority, yet that
every one receives the understanding of this law according to his own judgment. For it has
so been written by Him who created the world, that the faith of things is made to depend
upon it. Whence, whether any one wishes to bring forward truth, or any one to bring forward
falsehood, no assertion will be received without this law. Inasmuch, therefore, as my
knowledge is most fully in accordance with the law, I rightly declared that there are many
gods, of whom one is more eminent than the rest, and incomprehensible, even He who is
God of gods. But that there are many gods, the law itself informs me. For, in the first place,
it says this in the passage where one in the figure of a serpent speaks to Eve, the first woman,
‘On the day ye eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye shall be as gods,’631 that
is, as those who made man; and after they have tasted of the tree, God Himself testifies,
saying to the rest of the gods, ‘Behold, Adam is become as one of us;’632 thus, therefore, it
is manifest that there were many gods engaged in the making of man. Also, whereas at the
first God said to the other gods, ‘Let us make man after our image and likeness;’633 also His
saying, ‘Let us drive him out;’634 and again, ‘Come, let us go down, and confound their
language;’635 all these things indicate that there are many gods. But this also is written,
‘Thou shalt not curse the gods, nor curse the chief of thy people;’636 and again this writing,
‘God alone led them, and there was no strange god with them,’637 shows that there are many
gods. There are also many other testimonies which might be adduced from the law, not
only obscure, but plain, by which it is taught that there are many gods.638 One of these was
chosen by lot, that he might be the god of the Jews. But it is not of him that I speak, but of
that God who is also his God, whom even the Jews themselves did not know. For he is not
their God, but the God of those who know him.”</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—Peter’s Answer.</head>
<p>When Peter had heard this, he answered: “Fear nothing, Simon: for, behold, we have
neither shut our ears, nor fled; but we answer with words of truth to those things which you
have spoken falsely, asserting this first, that there is one God, even the God of the Jews, who
is the only God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who is also the God of all those whom you
call gods. If, then, I shall show you that none is superior to Him, but that He Himself is
above all, you will confess that your error is above all.”639 Then Simon said: “Why, indeed,
though I should be unwilling to confess it, would not the hearers who stand by charge me
with unwillingness to profess the things that are true?”</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—The Answer, Continued.</head>
<p>“Listen, then,” says Peter, “that you may know, first of all, that even if there are many
gods, as you say, they are subject to the God of the Jews, to whom no one is equal, than
whom no one can be greater; for it is written that the prophet Moses thus spoke to the Jews:
‘The Lord your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great God.’640 Thus, although
there are many that are called gods, yet He who is the God of the Jews is alone called
the God of gods. For not every one that is called God is necessarily God. Indeed, even
Moses is called a god to Pharaoh,641 and it is certain that he was a man; and judges were
called gods, and it is evident that they were mortal. The idols also of the Gentiles are called
gods, and we all know that they are not; but this has been inflicted as a punishment on the
wicked, that because they would not acknowledge the true God, they should regard as God
whatever form or image should occur to them. Because they refused to receive the knowledge
of the One who, as I said, is God of all, therefore it is permitted to them to have as gods
those who can do nothing for their worshippers. For what can either dead images or living
creatures confer upon men, since the power of all things is with One?</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Guardian Angels.</head>
<p>“Therefore the name God is applied in three ways:642 either because he to whom it is
given is truly God, or because he is the servant of him who is truly; and for the honour of
the sender, that his authority may be full, he that is sent is called by the name of him who
sends, as is often done in respect of angels: for when they appear to a man, if he is a wise
and intelligent man, he asks the name of him who appears to him, that he may acknowledge
at once the honour of the sent, and the authority of the sender. For every nation has an
angel, to whom God has committed the government of that nation; and when one of these
appears, although he be thought and called God by those over whom he presides, yet, being
asked, he does not give such testimony to himself. For the Most High God, who alone holds
the power of all things, has divided all the nations of the earth into seventy-two parts, and
over these He hath appointed angels as princes. But to the one among the archangels who
is greatest, was committed the government of those who, before all others, received the
worship and knowledge of the Most High God. But holy men also, as we have said, are
made gods to the wicked, as having received the power of life and death over them, as we
mentioned above with respect to Moses and the judges. Wherefore it is also written concerning
them, ‘Thou shalt not curse the gods, and thou shalt not curse the prince of thy
people.’643 Thus the princes of the several nations are called gods. But Christ is God of
princes, who is Judge of all. Therefore neither angels, nor men, nor any creature, can be
truly gods, forasmuch as they are placed under authority, being created and changeable:
angels, for they were not, and are; men, for they are mortal; and every creature, for it is
capable of dissolution, if only He dissolve it who made it. And therefore He alone is the
true God, who not only Himself lives, but also bestows life upon others, which He can also
take away when it pleaseth Him.</p>

seeing that I am God, and there is none else besides me, I will kill, and I will make
alive; I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who can deliver out of my hands.’644
See therefore how, by some ineffable virtue, the Scripture, opposing the future errors of
those who should affirm that either in heaven or on earth there is any other god besides
Him who is the God of the Jews, decides thus: ‘The Lord your God is one God, in heaven
above, and in the earth beneath; and besides Him there is none else.’645 How, then, hast
thou dared to say that there is any other God besides Him who is the God of the Jews? And
again the Scripture says, ‘Behold, to the Lord thy God belong the heaven, and the heaven
of heavens, the earth, and all things that are in them: nevertheless I have chosen your fathers,
that I might love them, and you after them.’646 Thus that judgment is supported by the
Scripture on every side, that He who created the world is the true and only God.</p>

<p>“But even if there be others, as we have said, who are called gods, they are under the
power of the God of the Jews; for thus saith the Scripture to the Jews, ‘The Lord our God,
He is God of gods, and Lord of lords.’647 Him alone the Scripture also commands to be
worshipped, saying, ‘Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve;’648
and, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God.’649 Yea, also the saints, filled with the
Spirit of God, and bedewed with the drops of His mercy, cried out, saying, ‘Who is like unto
Thee among the gods? O Lord, who is like unto Thee?’650 And again, ‘Who is God, but the
Lord; and who is God, but our Lord?’651 Therefore Moses, when he saw that the people
were advancing, by degrees initiated them in the understanding of the monarchy and the
faith of one God, as he says in the following words: ‘Thou shalt not make mention of the
names of other gods;’652 doubtless remembering with what penalty the serpent was visited,
which had first named gods.653 For it is condemned to feed upon dust, and is judged worthy
of such food, for this cause, that it first of all introduced the name of gods into the world.
But if you also wish to introduce many gods, see that you partake not the serpent’s doom.</p>

<p>“For be sure of this, that you shall not have us participators in this attempt; nor will we
suffer ourselves to be deceived by you. For it will not serve us for an excuse in the judgment,
if we say that you deceived us; because neither could it excuse the first woman, that she had
unhappily believed the serpent; but she was condemned to death, because she believed
badly. For this cause therefore, Moses, also commending the faith of one God to the people,
says, ‘Take heed to thyself, that thou be not seduced from the Lord thy God.’654 Observe
that he makes use of the same word which the first woman also made use of in excusing
herself, saying that she was seduced; but it profited her nothing. But over and above all this,
even if some true prophet should arise, who should perform signs and miracles, but should
wish to persuade us to worship other gods besides the God of the Jews, we should never be
able to believe him. For so the divine law has taught us, handing down a secret injunction
more purely by means of tradition, for thus it saith: ‘If there arise among you a prophet, or
one dreaming a dream, and give you signs or wonders, and these signs or wonders come to
pass, and he say to you, Let us go and worship strange gods, whom ye know not; ye shall
not hear the words of that prophet, nor the dream of that dreamer, because proving he hath
proved you, that he may see if ye love the Lord your God.’655</p>

were really a prophet, and performed signs and wonders, as you promise to do, if you were
to announce other gods besides Him who is the true God, it would be manifest that you
were raised up as a trial to the people of God; and therefore you can by no means be believed.
For He alone is the true God, who is the God of the Jews; and for this reason our Lord Jesus
Christ did not teach them that they must inquire after God, for Him they knew well already,
but that they must seek His kingdom and righteousness,656 which the scribes and Pharisees,
having received the key of knowledge, had not shut in, but shut out.657 For if they had been
ignorant of the true God, surely He would never have left the knowledge of this thing, which
was the chief of all, and blamed them for small and little things, as for enlarging their fringes,
and claiming the uppermost rooms in feasts, and praying standing in the highways, and
such like things; which assuredly, in comparison of this great charge, ignorance of God,

knew the God who was his creator, and the maker of the world; and Enoch knew him,
inasmuch as he was translated by him; and Noah, since he was ordered by him to construct
the ark; and although Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and all, even every people
and all nations, know the maker of the world, and confess him to be a God, yet your Jesus,
who appeared long after the patriarchs, says: ‘No one knows the Son, but the Father; neither

not known by you alone. Yea, if our Jesus knows Him, then Moses also, who prophesied
that Jesus should come, assuredly could not himself be ignorant of Him. For he was a
prophet; and he who prophesied of the Son doubtless knew the Father. For if it is in the
option of the Son to reveal the Father to whom He will, then the Son, who has been with
the Father from the beginning, and through all generations, as He revealed the Father to
Moses, so also to the other prophets; but if this be so, it is evident that the Father has not
been unknown to any of them. But how could the Father be revealed to you, who do not
believe in the Son, since the Father is known to none except him to whom the Son is pleased
to reveal Him? But the Son reveals the Father to those who honour the Son as they honour
the Father.”660</p>

But on these points there is not time now to show your profound folly, for I hasten to make

there is a certain power, and should presume to affirm this to others, before he himself is
sure of what he says? Is any one so rash as to believe your words, of which he sees that you
are yourself doubtful, and to admit that there is a certain power unknown to God the Creator,
and to Moses, and the prophets, and the law, and even to Jesus our Master, which power is
so good, that it will not make itself known to any but to one only, and that one such an one
as thou! Then, further, if that is a new power, why does it not confer upon us some new
sense, in addition to those five which we possess, that by that new sense, bestowed upon us
by it, we may be able to receive and understand itself which is new? Or if it cannot bestow
such a sense upon us, how has it bestowed it upon you? Or if it has revealed itself to you,
why not also to us? But if you of yourself understand things which not even the prophets
were able to perceive or understand, come, tell us what each one of us is thinking now; for
if there is such a spirit in you that you know those things which are above the heavens, which
are unknown to all, and incomprehensible by all, much more easily do you know the thoughts

we all enjoy, you cannot assert the existence of a new God.” Then Simon answered: “Since
all things that exist are in accordance with those five senses, that power which is more excellent
than all cannot add anything new.” Then Peter said: “It is false; for there is also a sixth
sense, namely that of foreknowledge: for those five senses are capable of knowledge, but
the sixth is that of foreknowledge: and this the prophets possessed. How, then, can you
know a God who is unknown to all, who do not know the prophetic sense, which is that of
prescience?” Then Simon began to say: “This power of which I speak, incomprehensible

no account can be given,663 that there is one God, who is better than all, from whom all that
is took its beginning; whence also of necessity, all things that are after him are subject to
him, as the chief and most excellent of all. When, therefore, I had ascertained that the God
who created the world, according to what the law teaches, is in many respects weak,
whereas weakness is utterly incompatible with a perfect God, and I saw that he is not perfect,
I necessarily concluded that there is another God who is perfect.664 For this God, as I have
said, according to what the writing of the law teaches, is shown to be weak in many things.
In the first place, because the man whom he formed was not able to remain such as he had
intended him to be; and because he cannot be good who gave a law to the first man, that he
should eat of all the trees of paradise, but that he should not touch the tree of knowledge;
and if he should eat of it, he should die. For why should he forbid him to eat, and to know
what is good and what evil, that, knowing, he might shun the evil and choose the good?
But this he did not permit; and because he did eat in violation of the commandment, and
discovered what is good, and learned for the sake of honour to cover his nakedness (for he
perceived it to be unseemly to stand naked before his Creator), he condemns to death him
who had learned to do honour to God, and curses the serpent who had shown him these
things. But truly, if man was to be injured by this means, why did he place the cause of injury
in paradise at all? But if that which he placed in paradise was good, it is not the part of one
that is good to restrain another from good.”</p>

For it is of necessity that there be one most excellent of all, on whose account also every
creature keeps its rank. Whence also I, knowing that it is every way necessary that there be
some one more benignant and more powerful than that imperfect God who gave the law,
understanding what is perfect from comparison of the imperfect, understood even from
the Scripture that God who is not mentioned there. And in this way I was able, O Peter, to
learn from the law what the law did not know. But even if the law had not given indications
from which it might be gathered that the God who made the world is imperfect, it was still
possible for me to infer from those evils which are done in this world, and are not corrected,
either that its creator is powerless, if he cannot correct what is done amiss; or else, if he does
not wish to remove the evils, that he is himself evil; but if he neither can nor will, that he is
neither powerful nor good. And from this it cannot but be concluded that there is another
God more excellent and more powerful than all. If you have aught to say to this, say on.”</p>

do not read the law with the instruction of masters, but account themselves teachers, and
think that they can understand the law, though he has not explained it to them who has
learned of the Master.665 Nevertheless now, that we also may seem to follow the book of
the law according to your apprehension of it; inasmuch as you say that the creator of the
world is shown to be both impotent and evil, how is it that you do not see that that power
of yours, which you say is superior to all, fails and lies under the very same charges? For
the very same thing may be said of it, that it is either powerless, since it does not correct
those things which here are done amiss; or if it can and will not, it is evil; or if it neither can
nor will, then it is both impotent and imperfect. Whence that new power of yours is not
only found liable to a similar charge, but even to a worse one, if, in addition to all these
things, it is believed to be, when it is not. For He who created the world, His existence is
manifest by His very operation in creating the world, as you yourself also confess. But this

whether you call him light, and brighter than that light which we see, you borrow that very
name from the Creator of the world; or whether you say that he is a substance above all,
you derive from Him the idea with enlargement of speech.666 Whether you make mention

then, you have nothing new concerning that power you speak of, not only as regards understanding,

you cannot even find a new name? For not only is the Creator of the world called a Power,

better that we should follow our Creator God, as a Father who trains us and endows us as
He knows how? But if, as you say, there be some God more benignant than all, it is certain
that he will not be angry with us; or if he be angry, he is evil. For if our God is angry and
punishes, He is not evil, but righteous, for He corrects and amends His own sons. But he
who has no concern with us, if he shall punish us, how should he be good? Inflicting punishments

then he was not prescient; while if he foreknew it, and suffered it, he is himself guilty of this
deed, since he did not prevent it; but if he could not, then he is not omnipotent. But if,
knowing it as good, he did not prohibit it, he is found to be better, who presumed to do that
which he who sent him did not know to be good.”</p>

<p>Then Simon said: “He receives those who will come to him, and does them good.”
Peter answered: “But there is nothing new in this; for He whom you acknowledge to be the
Creator of the world also does so.” Then Simon: “But the good God bestows salvation if
he is only acknowledged; but the creator of the world demands also that the law be fulfilled.”
Then said Peter: “He saves adulterers and men-slayers, if they know him; but good, and
sober, and merciful persons, if they do not know him, in consequence of their having no
information concerning him, he does not save! Great and good truly is he whom you proclaim,
who is not so much the saviour of the evil, as he is one who shows no mercy to the
good.” Then Simon: “It is truly very difficult for man to know him, as long as he is in the
flesh; for blacker than all darkness, and heavier than all clay, is this body with which the
soul is surrounded.” Then says Peter: “That good God of yours demands things which are
difficult; but He who is truly God seeks easier things. Let him then, since he is so good,
leave us with our Father and Creator; and when once we depart from the body, and leave
that darkness that you speak of, we shall more easily know Him; and then the soul shall
better understand that God is its Creator, and shall remain with Him, and shall no more be
harassed with diverse imaginations; nor shall wish to betake itself to another power, which
is known to none but Simon only, and which is of such goodness that no one can come to
it, unless he be first guilty of impiety towards his own father! I know not how this power
can be called either good or just, which no one can please except by acting impiously towards
him by whom he was made!”</p>

<p>Then Simon: “It is not impious for the sake of greater profit and advantage to flee to
him who is of richer glory.” Then Peter: “If, as you say, it is not impious to flee to a stranger,
it is at all events much more pious to remain with our own father, even if he be poor. But
if you do not think it impious to leave our father, and flee to another, as being better than
he; and you do not believe that our Creator will take this amiss; much more the good God
will not be angry, because, when we were strangers to him, we have not fled to him, but
have remained with our own Creator. Yea, I think he will rather commend us the more for
this, that we have kept faith with God our Creator; for he will consider that, if we had been
his creatures, we should never have been seduced by the allurements of any other to forsake
him. For if any one, allured by richer promises, shall leave his own father and betake himself
to a stranger, it may be that he will leave him in his turn, and go to another who shall
promise him greater things, and this the rather because he is not his son, since he could
leave even him who by nature was his father.” Then Simon said: “But what if souls are from
him, and do not know him, and he is truly their father?”</p>

<p>Then Peter said: “You represent him as weak enough. For if, as you say, he is more
powerful than all, it can never be believed the weaker wrenched the spoils from the
stronger.667 Or if God the Creator was able by violence to bring down souls into this world,
how can it be that, when they are separated from the body and freed from the bonds of
captivity, the good God shall call them to the sufferance of punishment, on the ground that
they, either through his remissness or weakness, were dragged away to this place, and were
involved in the body, as in the darkness of ignorance? You seem to me not to know what
a father and a God is: but I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they
were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you, who are in
such error in respect of the knowledge of God.” Then said Simon: “A time will come when
you shall be sorry that you did not understand me speaking of the ineffable power.” Then
said Peter: “Give us then, as I have often said, as being yourself a new God, or as having
yourself come down from him, some new sense, by means of which we may know that new
God of whom you speak; for those five senses, which God our Creator has given us, keep
faith to their own Creator, and do not perceive that there is any other God, for so their
nature necessitates them.”</p>

<p>To this Simon answered: “Apply your mind to those things which I am going to say,
and cause it, walking in peaceable paths, to attain to those things which I shall demonstrate.
Listen now, therefore. Did you never in thought reach forth your mind into regions or islands
situated far away, and remain so fixed in them, that you could not even see the people that
were before you, or know where yourself were sitting, by reason of the delightfulness of
those things on which you were gazing?” And Peter said: “It is true, Simon, this has often
occurred to me.” Then Simon said: “In this way now reach forth your sense into heaven,
yea above the heaven, and behold that there must be some place beyond the world, or outside
the world, in which there is neither heaven nor earth, and where no shadow of these things
produces darkness; and consequently, since there are neither bodies in it, nor darkness occasioned
by bodies, there must of necessity be immense light; and consider of what sort that
light must be, which is never succeeded by darkness. For if the light of this sun fills this
whole world, how great do you suppose that bodiless and infinite light to be? So great,
doubtless, that this light of the sun would seem to be darkness and not light, in comparison.”</p>

<p>When Simon thus spoke, Peter answered:668 “Now listen patiently concerning both
these matters, that is, concerning the example of stretching out the senses, and concerning
the immensity of light. I know that I myself, O Simon, have sometimes in thought extended
my sense, as you say, into regions and islands situated afar off, and have seen them with my
mind not less than if it had been with my eyes. When I was at Capernaum, occupied in the
taking of fishes, and sat upon a rock, holding in my hand a hook attached to a line, and fitted
for deceiving the fishes, I was so absorbed that I did not feel a fish adhering to it while my
mind eagerly ran through my beloved Jerusalem, to which I had frequently gone up, waking,
for the sake of offerings and prayers. But I was accustomed also to admire this Cæsarea,
hearing of it from others, and to long to see it; and I seemed to myself to see it, although I
had never been in it; and I thought of it what was suitable to be thought of a great city, its
gates, walls, baths, streets, lanes, markets, and the like, in accordance with what I had seen
in other cities; and to such an extent was I delighted with the intentness of such inspection,
that, as you said, I neither saw one who was present and standing by me, nor knew where
myself was sitting.” Then said Simon: “Now you say well.”</p>

that I had caught a very large fish which was attached to the hook, and that although it was
dragging the hook-line from my hand, my brother Andrew, who was sitting by me, seeing
me in a reverie and almost ready to fall, thrusting his elbow into my side as if he would
awaken me from sleep, said: ‘Do you not see, Peter, what a large fish you have caught? Are
you out of your senses, that you are thus in a stupor of astonishment? Tell me, What is the
matter with you?’ But I was angry with him for a little, because he had withdrawn me from
the delight of those things which I was contemplating; then I answered that I was not suffering
from any malady, but that I was mentally gazing on the beloved Jerusalem, and at the same
time on Cæsarea; and that, while I was indeed with him in the body, in my mind I was wholly
carried away thither. But he, I know not whence inspired, uttered a hidden and secret word
of truth.”</p>

They are first carried away by fancies to some pleasant and delightful things, then they are
poured out in vain and fond motions towards things which have no existence. Now this
happens from a certain disease of mind, by reason of which they see not the things which
are, but long to bring to their sight those which are not. But thus it happens also to those
who are suffering phrenzy, and seem to themselves to see many images, because their soul,
being torn and withdrawn from its place by excess of cold or of heat, suffers a failure of its
natural service. But those also who are in distress through thirst, when they fall asleep, seem
to themselves to see rivers and fountains, and to drink; but this befalls them through being

<p>“In short, that you may receive the faith of the matter; concerning Jerusalem, which I
had often seen, I told my brother what places and what gatherings of people I had seemed
to myself to see. But also concerning Cæsarea, which I had never seen, I nevertheless contended
that it was such as I had conceived it in my mind and thought. But when I came
hither, and saw nothing at all like to those things which I had seen in phantasy, I blamed
myself, and observed distinctly, that I had assigned to it gates, and walls, and buildings from
others which I had seen, taking the likeness in reality from others. Nor indeed can any one
imagine anything new, and of which no form has ever existed. For even if any one should
fashion from his imagination bulls with five heads, he only forms them with five heads out
of those which he has seen with one head. And you therefore, now, if truly you seem to
yourself to perceive anything with your thought, and to look above the heavens, there is no
doubt but that you imagine them from those things which you see, placed as you are upon
the earth. But if you think that there is easy access for your mind above the heavens, and
that you are able to conceive the things that are there, and to apprehend knowledge of that
immense light, I think that for him who can comprehend these things, it were easier to
throw his sense, which knows how to ascend thither, into the heart and breast of some one
of us who stand by, and to tell what thoughts he is cherishing in his breast. If therefore you
can declare the thoughts of the heart of any one of us, who is not pre-engaged in your favour,
we shall perhaps be able to believe you, that you are able to know those things that are above
the heavens, although these are much loftier.”</p>

<p>To this Simon replied:669 “O thou who hast woven a web of many frivolities, listen
now. It is impossible that anything which comes into a man’s thoughts should not also
subsist in truth and reality. For things that do not subsist, have no appearances;670 but
things that have no appearances, cannot present themselves to our thoughts.” Then said
Peter: “If everything that can come into our thoughts has a subsistence, then, with respect
to that place of immensity which you say is outside the world, if one thinks in his heart that
it is light, and another that it is darkness, how can one and the same place be both light and
darkness, according to their different thoughts concerning it?” Then said Simon: “Let pass

<p>Then said Peter: “If you believed concerning the true fountain of light, I could instruct
you what and of what sort is that which is immense, and should render, not a vain fancy,
but a consistent and necessary account of the truth, and should make use, not of sophistical
assertions, but testimonies of the law and nature, that you might know that the law especially
contains what we ought to believe in regard to immensity. But if the doctrine of immensity
is not unknown to the law, then assuredly, nought else can be unknown to it; and therefore
it is a false supposition of yours, that there is anything of which the law is not cognisant.
Much more shall nothing be unknown to Him who gave the law. Yet I cannot speak anything
to you of immensity and of those things which are without limit, unless first you either accept
our account of those heavens which are bounded by a certain limit, or else propound your
own account of them. But if you cannot understand concerning those which are comprehended
within fixed boundaries, much more can you neither know nor learn anything

<head>Chapter LXVIII.—The Visible and the Invisible Heaven.</head>
<p>To this Simon answered: “It seems to me to be better to believe simply that God is, and
that that heaven which we see is the only heaven in the whole universe.” But Peter said:
“Not so; but it is proper to confess one God who truly is; but that there are heavens, which
were made by Him, as also the law says, of which one is the higher, in which also is contained
the visible firmament; and that that higher heaven is perpetual and eternal, with those who
dwell in it; but that this visible heaven is to be dissolved and to pass away at the end of the
world, in order that that heaven which is older and higher may appear after the judgment
to the holy and the worthy.” To this Simon answered: “That these things are so, as you say,
may appear to those who believe them; but to him who seeks for reasons of these things, it
is impossible that they can be produced from the law, and especially concerning the immensity
of light.”</p>

<p>Then Peter: “Do not think that we say that these things are only to be received by faith,
but also that they are to be asserted by reason. For indeed it is not safe to commit these
things to bare faith without reason, since assuredly truth cannot be without reason. And
therefore he who has received these things fortified by reason, can never lose them; whereas
he who receives them without proofs, by an assent to a simple statement of them, can neither
keep them safely, nor is certain if they are true; because he who easily believes, also easily
yields. But he who has sought reason for those things which he has believed and received,
as though bound by chains of reason itself, can never be torn away or separated from those
things which he hath believed. And therefore, according as any one is more anxious in demanding
a reason, by so much will he be the firmer in preserving his faith.”</p>

and oppose you to-morrow; and if you can prove that this world was created, and that souls
are immortal, you shall have me to assist you in your preaching.” When he had said thus,
he departed, and was followed by a third part of all the people who had come with him, who
were about one thousand men. But the rest with bended knees prostrated themselves before
Peter; and he, invoking upon them the name of God, cured some who had demons, healed
others who were sick, and so dismissed the people rejoicing, commanding them to come
early the next day. But Peter, when the crowds had withdrawn, commanded the table to be
spread on the ground, in the open air, in the court where the disputation had been held,
and sat down together with those eleven; but I dined reclining with some others who also

not yet been purified; but I fear lest perhaps I should injure myself, and do no good to
them.671 For this I would have you know for certain, that every one who has at any time
worshipped idols, and has adored those whom the pagans call gods, or has eaten of the
things sacrificed to them, is not without an unclean spirit; for he has become a guest of
demons, and has been partaker with that demon of which he has formed the image in his
mind, either through fear or love.672 And by these means he is not free from an unclean
spirit, and therefore needs the purification of baptism, that the unclean spirit may go out
of him, which has made its abode in the inmost affections of his soul, and what is worse,
gives no indication that it lurks within, for fear it should be exposed and expelled.”</p>

<p>“For these unclean spirits love to dwell in the bodies of men, that they may fulfil their
own desires by their service, and, inclining the motions of their souls to those things which
they themselves desire, may compel them to obey their own lusts, that they may become
wholly vessels of demons.673 One of whom is this Simon, who is seized with such disease,
and cannot now be healed, because he is sick in his will and purpose. Nor does the demon
dwell in him against his will; and therefore, if any one would drive it out of him, since it is
inseparable from himself, and, so to speak, has now become his very soul, he should seem
rather to kill him, and to incur the guilt of manslaughter. Let no one of you therefore be
saddened at being separated from eating with us, for every one ought to observe that it is
for just so long a time as he pleases. For he who wishes soon to be baptized is separated but
for a little time, but he for a longer who wishes to be baptized later. Every one therefore has
it in his own power to demand a shorter or a longer time for his repentance; and therefore
it lies with you, when you wish it, to come to our table; and not with us, who are not permitted
to take food with any one who has not been baptized. It is rather you, therefore, who hinder
us from eating with you, if you interpose delays in the way of your purification, and defer
your baptism.” Having said thus, and having blessed, he took food. And afterwards, when
he had given thanks to God, he went into the house and went to bed; and we all did the like,
for it was now night.</p>

is may not be spoken to all as it is, on account of those who hear wickedly and treacherously;
yet it is not proper to deceive, on account of those who desire to hear the truth sincerely.
What, then, shall he do who has to address a mixed multitude? Shall he conceal what is
true? How, then, shall he instruct those who are worthy? But if he set forth pure truth to
those who do not desire to obtain salvation, he does injury to Him by whom he has been
sent, and from whom he has received commandment not to throw the pearls of His words
before swine and dogs,675 who, striving against them with arguments and sophisms, roll
them in the mud of carnal understanding, and by their barkings and base answers break
and weary the preachers of God’s word. Wherefore I also, for the most part, by using a
certain circumlocution, endeavour to avoid publishing the chief knowledge concerning the

men, who call me a magician, and love Peter; whereas, having knowledge of me of old, they
ought to love me rather. And therefore from this sign those who have sense may understand

you but even hate you, learn the reason from me. Since you are a seducer you profess to
proclaim the truth; and on this account you had many friends who had a desire to learn the
truth. But when they saw in you things contrary to what you professed, they being, as I said,
lovers of truth, began not only not to love you, but even to hate you. But yet they did not
immediately forsake you, because you still promised that you could show them what is true.
As long, therefore, as no one was present who could show them, they bore with you; but
since the hope of better instruction has dawned upon them, they despise you, and seek to
know what they understand to be better. And you indeed, acting by nefarious arts, thought
at first that you should escape detection. But you are detected. For you are driven into a
corner, and, contrary to your expectation, you are made notorious, not only as being ignorant
of the truth, but as being unwilling to hear it from those who know it. For if you had been

higher is the abode of that light, in which the ineffable Father dwells alone for ever; but that
after the pattern of that heaven is made this visible heaven, which you asserted is to pass
away. You said, therefore, that the Father of all is one, because there cannot be two infinites;
else neither of them would be infinite, because in that in which the one subsists, he makes
a limit of the subsistence of the other. Since then you not only promised this, but are able
to show it from the law, leave off other matters and set about this.” Then Peter said: “If I
were asked to speak of these things only on your account, who come only for the purpose
of contradicting, you should never hear a single discourse from me; but seeing it is necessary
that the husbandman, wishing to sow good ground, should sow some seeds, either in stony

you indeed wish to seduce the people, but that I teach the truth. But now I refrain from a
discussion concerning that boundless light. Answer me, therefore, what I ask of you. Since
God, as you say, made all things, whence comes evil?”680 Then said Peter: “To put questions
in this way is not the part of an opponent, but of a learner. If therefore you wish to learn,
confess it; and I shall first teach you how you ought to learn, and when you have learned to
listen, then straightway I shall begin to teach you. But if you do not wish to learn, as though

with your ignorance and your arrogance. I confess, then, I do wish to learn; let us see how
you can teach me.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Existence of Evil.</head>
<p>Then Peter said: “If you truly wish to learn, then first learn this, how unskilfully you
have framed your question; for you say, Since God has created all things, whence is evil?
But before you asked this, three sorts of questions should have had the precedence: First,
Whether there be evil? Secondly, What evil is? Thirdly, To whom it is, and whence?” To
this Simon answered: “Oh thou most unskilful and unlearned, is there any man who does
not confess that there is evil in this life? Whence I also, thinking that you had even the
common sense of all men, asked, whence evil is; not as wishing to learn, since I know all
things, least of all from you, who know nothing, but that I might show you to be ignorant
of all things. And that you may not suppose that it is because I am angry that I speak
somewhat sternly, know that I am moved with compassion for those who are present, whom
you are attempting to deceive.” Then Peter said: “The more wicked are you, if you can do
such wrong, not being angry; but smoke must rise where there is fire. Nevertheless I shall
tell you, lest I should seem to take you up with words, so as not to answer to those things
which you have spoken disorderly. You say that all confess the existence of evil, which is
verily false; for, first of all, the whole Hebrew nation deny its existence.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Not Admitted by All.</head>
<p>Then Simon, interrupting his discourse, said: “They do rightly who say that there is no
evil.” Then Peter answered: “We do not propose to speak of this now, but only to state the
fact that the existence of evil is not universally admitted. But the second question that you
should have asked is, What is evil?—a substance, an accident, or an act? And many other
things of the same sort. And after that, towards what, or how it is, or to whom it is
evil,—whether to God, or to angels, or to men, to the righteous or the wicked, to all or to
some, to one’s self or to no one? And then you should inquire, Whence it is?—whether
from God, or from nothing; whether it has always been, or has had its beginning in time;
whether it is useful or useless? and many other things which a proposition of this sort demands.”
To this Simon answered: “Pardon me; I was in error concerning the first question;
but suppose that I now ask first, whether evil is or not?”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="294"/>
<head>Chapter XVIII.—Manner of Conducting the Discussion.</head>
<p>Then Peter said: “In what way do you put the question; as wishing to learn, or to teach
or for the sake of raising the question? If indeed as wishing to learn, I have something to
teach you first, that coming by consequence and the right order of doctrine, you may understand
from yourself what evil is. But if you put the question as an instructor, I have no need
to be taught by you, for I have a Master from whom I have learned all things. But if you ask
merely for the sake of raising a question and disputing, let each of us first set forth his
opinion, and so let the matter be debated. For it is not reasonable that you should ask as
one wishing to learn, and contradict as one teaching, so that after my answer it should be
in your discretion to say whether I have spoken well or ill. Wherefore you cannot stand in
the place of a gainsayer and be judge of what we say. And therefore, as I said, if a discussion
is to be held, let each of us state his sentiments; and while we are placed in conflict, these
religious hearers will be just judges.”</p>

<pb n="295"/>
<head>Chapter XIX.—Desire of Instruction.</head>
<p>Then Simon said: “Does it not seem to you to be absurd that an unskilled people should
sit in judgment upon our sayings?” Then Peter: “It is not so; for what perhaps is less clear
to one, can be investigated by many, for oftentimes even a popular rumour has the aspect
of a prophecy. But in addition to all this, all these people stand here constrained by the love
of God, and by a desire to know the truth, and therefore all these are to be regarded as one,
by reason of their affection being one and the same towards the truth; as, on the other hand,
two are many and diverse, if they disagree with each other. But if you wish to receive an
indication how all these people who stand before us are as one man, consider from their
very silence and quietness how with all patience, as you see, they do honour to the truth of
God, even before they learn it, for they have not yet learned the greater observance which
they owe to it. Wherefore I hope, through the mercy of God, that He will accept the religious
purpose of their mind towards Him, and will give the palm of victory to him who preaches
the truth, that He may make manifest to them the herald of truth.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="296"/>
<head>Chapter XX.—Common Principles.</head>
<p>Then Simon: “On what subject do you wish the discussion to be held? Tell me, that I
also may define what I think, and so the inquiry may begin.” And Peter answered: “If indeed,
you will do as I think right, I would have it done according to the precept of my Master,
who first of all commanded the Hebrew nation, whom He knew to have knowledge of God,
and that it is He who made the world, not that they should inquire about Him whom they
knew, but that, knowing Him, they should investigate His will and His righteousness; because
it is placed in men’s power that, searching into these things, they may find, and do, and
observe those things concerning which they are to be judged. Therefore He commanded
us to inquire, not whence evil cometh, as you asked just now, but to seek the righteousness
of the good God, and His kingdom; and all these things, says He, shall be added to you.”681
Then Simon said: “Since these things are commanded to Hebrews, as having a right
knowledge of God, and being of opinion that every one has it in his power to do these things
concerning which he is to be judged,—but my opinion differs from theirs,—where do you
wish me to begin?”</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Freedom of the Will.</head>
<p>Then said Peter: “I advise that the first inquiry be, whether it be in our power to know
whence we are to be judged.” But Simon said: “Not so; but concerning God, about whom
all who are present are desirous to hear.” Then Peter: “You admit, then, that something is
in the power of the will: only confess this, if it is so, and let us inquire, as you say, concerning
God.” To this Simon answered: “By no means.” Then Peter said: “If, then, nothing is in
our power, it is useless for us to inquire anything concerning God, since it is not in the
power of those who seek to find; hence I said well, that this should be the first inquiry,
whether anything is in the power of the will.”682 Then said Simon: “We cannot even understand
this that you say, if there is anything in the power of the will.” But Peter, seeing
that he was turning to contention, and, through fear of being overcome, was confounding
all things as being in general uncertain, answered: “How then do you know that it is not in
the power of man to know anything, since this very thing at least you know?”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Responsibility.</head>
<p>Then Simon said: “I know not whether I know even this; for every one, according as it
is decreed to him by fate, either does, or understands, or suffers.” Then Peter said: “See,
my brethren, into what absurdities Simon has fallen, who before my coming was teaching
that men have it in their power to be wise and to do what they will, but now, driven into a
corner by the force of my arguments, he denies that man has any power either of perceiving
or of acting; and yet he presumes to profess himself to be a teacher! But tell me how then
God judges according to truth every one for his doings, if men have it not in their own
power to do anything? If this opinion be held, all things are torn up by the roots; vain will
be the desire of following after goodness; yea, even in vain do the judges of the world administer
laws and punish those who do amiss, for they had it not in their power not to sin; vain
also will be the laws of nations which assign penalties to evil deeds. Miserable also will those
be who laboriously keep righteousness; but blessed those who, living in pleasure, exercise
tyranny, living in luxury and wickedness. According to this, therefore, there can be neither
righteousness, nor goodness, nor any virtue, nor, as you would have it, any God. But, O
Simon, I know why you have spoken thus: truly because you wished to avoid inquiry, lest
you should be openly confuted; and therefore you say that it is not in the power of man to
perceive or to discern anything. But if this had really been your opinion, you would not
surely, before my coming, have professed yourself before the people to be a teacher. I say,
therefore, that man is under his own control.” Then said Simon: “What is the meaning of
being under his own control? Tell us.” To this Peter: “If nothing can be learned, why do
you wish to hear?” And Simon said: “You have nothing to answer to this.”</p>

<p>Then said Peter: “I shall speak, not as under compulsion from you, but at the request
of the hearers. The power of choice is the sense of the soul, possessing a quality by which
it can be inclined towards what acts it wills.” Then Simon, applauding Peter for what he
had spoken, said: “Truly you have expounded it magnificently and incomparably, for it is
my duty to bear testimony to your speaking well. Now if you will explain to me this which
I now ask you, in all things else I shall submit to you. What I wish to learn, then, is this: if
what God wishes to be, is; and what He does not wish to be, is not. Answer me this.” Then
Peter: “If you do not know that you are asking an absurd and incompetent question, I shall
pardon you and explain; but if you are aware that you are asking inconsequently, you do
not well.” Then Simon said: “I swear by the Supreme Divinity, whatsoever that may be,
which judges and punishes those who sin, that I know not what I have said inconsequently,
or what absurdity there is in my words, that is, in those that I have just uttered.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—God the Author of Good, Not of Evil.</head>
<p>To this Peter answered: “Since, then, you confess that you are ignorant, now learn.
Your question demanded our deliverance on two matters that are contrary to one another.
For every motion is divided into two parts, so that a certain part is moved by necessity, and
another by will; and those things which are moved by necessity are always in motion, those
which are moved by will, not always. For example, the sun’s motion is performed by necessity
to complete its appointed circuit, and every state and service of heaven depends upon necessary
motions. But man directs the voluntary motions of his own actions. And thus there
are some things which have been created for this end, that in their services they should be
subject to necessity, and should be unable to do aught else than what has been assigned to
them; and when they have accomplished this service, the Creator of all things, who thus
arranged them according to His will, preserves them. But there are other things, in which
there is a power of will, and which have a free choice of doing what they will. These, as I
have said, do not remain always in that order in which they were created: but according as
their will leads them, and the judgment of their mind inclines them, they effect either good
or evil; and therefore He hath proposed rewards to those who do well, and penalties to those
who do evil.683</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—“Who Hath Resisted His Will?”</head>
<p>You say, therefore, if God wishes anything to be, it is; and if He do not wish it, it is not.
But if I were to answer that what He wishes is, and what He wishes not is not, you would
say that then He wishes the evil things to be which are done in the world, since everything
that He wishes is, and everything that He wishes not is not. But if I had answered that it is
not so that what God wishes is, and what He wishes not is not, then you would retort upon
me that God must then be powerless, if He cannot do what He wills; and you would be all
the more petulant, as thinking that you had got a victory, though had said nothing to the
point. Therefore you are ignorant, O Simon, yea very ignorant, how the will of God acts in
each individual case. For some things, as we have said, He has so willed to be, that they
cannot be otherwise than as they are ordained by Him; and to these He has assigned neither
rewards nor punishments; but those which He has willed to be so that they have it in their
power to do what they will, He has assigned to them according to their actions and their
wills, to earn either rewards or punishments. Since, therefore, as I have informed you, all
things that are moved are divided into two parts, according to the distinction that I formerly
stated, everything that God wills is, and everything that He wills not is not.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—No Goodness Without Liberty.</head>
<p>To this Simon answered: “Was not He able to make us all such that we should be good,
and that we should not have it in our power to be otherwise?” Peter answered: “This also
is an absurd question. For if He had made us of an unchangeable nature and incapable of
being moved away from good, we should not be really good, because we could not be aught
else; and it would not be of our purpose that we were good; and what we did would not be
ours, but of the necessity of our nature.684 But how can that be called good which is not
done of purpose? And on this account the world required long periods, until the number
of souls which were predestined to fill it should be completed, and then that visible heaven
should be folded up like a scroll, and that which is higher should appear, and the souls of
the blessed, being restored to their bodies, should be ushered into light; but the souls of the
wicked, for their impure actions being surrounded with fiery spirit, should be plunged into
the abyss of unquenchable fire, to endure punishments through eternity. Now that these
things are so, the true Prophet. has testified to us; concerning whom, if you wish to know
that He is a prophet, I shall instruct you by innumerable declarations. For of those things
which were spoken by Him, even now everything that He said is being fulfilled; and those
things which He spoke with respect to the future are believed to be about to be fulfilled, for
faith is given to the future from those things which have already come to pass.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—The Visible Heaven: Why Made.</head>
<p>But Simon, perceiving that Peter was clearly assigning a reason from the head of
prophecy, from which the whole question is settled, declined that the discourse should take
this turn; and thus answered: “Give me an answer to the questions that I put, and tell me,
if that visible heaven is, as you say, to be dissolved, why was it made at first?” Peter answered:
“It was made for the sake of this present life of men, that there might be some sort of interposition
and separation, lest any unworthy one might see the habitation of the celestials and
the abode of God Himself, which are prepared in order to be seen by those only who are of
pure heart.685 But now, that is in the time of the conflict, it has pleased Him that those
things be invisible, which are destined as a reward to the conquerers.” Then Simon said:
“If the Creator is good, and the world is good, how shall He who is good ever destroy that
which is good? But if He shall destroy that which is good, how shall He Himself be thought
to be good? But if He shall dissolve and destroy it as evil, how shall He not appear to be
evil, who has made that which is evil?”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Why to Be Dissolved.</head>
<p>To this Peter replied: “Since we have promised not to run away from your blasphemies,
we endure them patiently, for you shall yourself render an account for the things that you
speak. Listen now, therefore. If indeed that heaven which is visible and transient had been
made for its own sake, there would have been some reason in what you say, that it ought
not to be dissolved. But if it was made not for its own sake, but for the sake of something
else, it must of necessity be dissolved, that that for which it seems to have been made may
appear. As I might say, by way of illustration, however fairly and carefully the shell of the
egg may seem to have been formed, it is yet necessary that it be broken and opened, that
the chick may issue from it, and that may appear for which the form of the whole egg seems
to have been moulded. So also, therefore, it is necessary that the condition of this world
pass away, that that sublimer condition of the heavenly kingdom may shine forth.”</p>

<p>Then Simon: “It does not seem to me that the heaven, which has been made by God,
can be dissolved. For things made by the Eternal One are eternal, while things made by a
corruptible one are temporary and decaying.” Then Peter: “It is not so. Indeed corruptible
and temporary things of all sorts are made by mortal creatures; but the Eternal does not always
make things corruptible, nor always incorruptible; but according to the will of God
the Creator, so will be the things which He creates. For the power of God is not subject to
law, but His will is law to His creatures.” Then Simon answered: “I call you back to the first
question. You said now that God is visible to no one; but when that heaven shall be dissolved,
and that superior condition of the heavenly kingdom shall shine forth, then those who are
pure in heart686 shall see God; which statement is contrary to the law, for there it is written
that God said, ‘None shall see my face and live.’”687</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—How the Pure in Heart See God.</head>
<p>Then Peter answered: “To those who do not read the law according to the tradition of
Moses, my speech appears to be contrary to it; but I will show you how it is not contradictory.
God is seen by the mind, not by the body; by the spirit, not by the flesh. Whence also angels,
who are spirits, see God; and therefore men, as long as they are men, cannot see Him. But
after the resurrection of the dead, when they shall have been made like the angels,688 they
shall be able to see God. And thus my statement is not contrary to the law; neither is that
which our Master said, ‘Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God.’689 For He
showed that a time shall come in which of men shall be made angels, who in the spirit of
their mind shall see God.” After these and many similar sayings, Simon began to assert with
many oaths, saying: “Concerning one thing only render me a reason, whether the soul is
immortal, and I shall submit to your will in all things. But let it be to-morrow, for to-day
it is late.” When therefore Peter began to speak, Simon went out, and with him a very few
of his associates; and that for shame. But all the rest, turning to Peter, on bended knees
prostrated themselves before him; and some of those who were afflicted with diverse sicknesses,
or invaded by demons, were healed by the prayer of Peter, and departed rejoicing,
as having obtained at once the doctrine of the true God, and also His mercy. When therefore
the crowds had withdrawn, and only we his attendants remained with him, we sat down on
couches placed on the ground, each one recognising his accustomed place, and having taken
food, and given thanks to God, we went to sleep.</p>

<p>But on the following day, Peter, as usual, rising before dawn, found us already awake
and ready to listen; and thus began: “I entreat you, my brethren and fellow-servants, that
if any of you is not able to wake, he should not torment himself through respect to my
presence, because sudden change is difficult; but if for a long time one gradually accustoms
himself, that will not be distressing which comes of use. For we had not all the same training;
although in course of time we shall be able to be moulded into one habit, for they say that
custom holds the place of a second nature. But I call God to witness that I am not offended,
if any one is not able to wake; but rather by this, if, when any one sleeps all through the
night, he does not in the course of the day fulfil that which he omitted in the night. For it
is necessary to give heed intently and unceasingly, to the study of doctrine, that our mind
may be filled with the thought of God only: because in the mind which is filled with the
thought of God, no place will be given to the wicked one.”</p>

<p>When Peter spoke thus to us, every one of us eagerly assured him, that ere now we were
awake, being satisfied with short sleep, but that we were afraid to arouse him, because it did
not become the disciples to command the master; “and yet even this, O Peter, we had almost
ventured to take upon ourselves, because our hearts, agitated with longing for your words,
drove sleep wholly from our eyes. But again our affection towards you opposed it, and did
not suffer us violently to rouse you.” Then Peter said: “Since therefore you assert that you
are willingly awake through desire of hearing, I wish to repeat to you more carefully, and
to explain in their order, the things that were spoken yesterday without arrangement. And
this I propose to do throughout these daily disputations, that by night, when privacy of time
and place is afforded, I shall unfold in correct order, and by a straight line of explanation,
anything that in the controversy has not been stated with sufficient fulness.” And then he
began to point out to us how the yesterday’s discussion ought to have been conducted, and
how it could not be so conducted on account of the contentiousness or the unskilfulness of
his opponent; and how therefore he only made use of assertion, and only overthrew what
was said by his adversary, but did not expound his own doctrines either completely or distinctly.
Then repeating the several matters to us, he discussed them in regular order and
with full reason.</p>

<p>But when the day began to be light, after prayer he went out to the crowds and stood
in his accustomed place, for the discussion; and seeing Simon standing in the middle of the

with respect to some men, who come to us in this way that they may learn something, but
when we begin to teach them, they profess that they themselves are masters, and while indeed
they ask questions as ignorant persons, they contradict as knowing ones. But perhaps some
one will say, that he who puts a question, puts it indeed in order that he may learn, but when
that which he hears does not seem to him to be right, it is necessary that he should answer,
and that seems to be contradiction which is not contradiction, but further inquiry.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Against Order is Against Reason.</head>
<p>“Let such a one then hear this: The teaching of all doctrine has a certain order, and
there are some things which must be delivered first, others in the second place, and others
in the third, and so all in their order; and if these things be delivered in their order, they
become plain; but if they be brought forward out of order, they will seem to be spoken
against reason. And therefore order is to be observed above all things, if we seek for the
purpose of finding what we seek. For he who enters rightly upon the road, will observe the
second place in due order, and from the second will more easily find the third; and the further
he proceeds, so much the more will the way of knowledge become open to him, even until
he arrive at the city of truth, whither he is bound, and which he desires to reach. But he
who is unskilful, and knows not the way of inquiry, as a traveller in a foreign country, ignorant
and wandering, if he will not employ a native of the country as a guide,—undoubtedly
when he has strayed from the way of truth, shall remain outside the gates of life, and so,
involved in the darkness of black night, shall walk through the paths of perdition. Inasmuch
therefore, as, if those things which are to be sought, be sought in an orderly manner, they
can most easily be found, but the unskilful man is ignorant of the order of inquiry, it is right
that the ignorant man should yield to the knowing one, and first learn the order of inquiry,
that so at length he may find the method of asking and answering.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Learning Before Teaching.</head>
<p>To this Simon replied: “Then truth is not the property of all, but of those only who
know the art of disputation, which is absurd; for it cannot be, since He is equally the God
of all, that all should not be equally able to know His will.” Then Peter: “All were made
equal by Him, and to all He has given equally to be receptive of truth. But that none of those
who are born, are born with education, but education is subsequent to birth, no one can
doubt. Since, therefore, the birth of men holds equity in this respect, that all are equally
capable of receiving discipline, the difference is not in nature, but in education. Who does
not know that the things which any one learns, he was ignorant of before he learned them?”
Then Simon said “You say truly.” Then Peter said, “If then in those arts which are in common
use, one first learns and then teaches, how much more ought those who profess to be the
educators of souls, first to learn, and so to teach, that they may not expose themselves to
ridicule, if they promise to afford knowledge to others, when they themselves are unskilful?”
Then Simon: “This is true in respect of those arts which are in common use; but in the word
of knowledge, as soon as any one has heard, he has learned.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">
<pb n="312"/>
<head>Chapter XXXVI.—Self-Evidence of the Truth.</head>
<p>Then said Peter: “If indeed one hear in an orderly and regular manner he is able to
know what is true; but he who refuses to submit to the rule of a reformed life and a pure
conversation, which truly is the proper result of knowledge of the truth, will not confess
that he knows what he does know. For this is exactly what we see in the case of some who,
abandoning the trades which they learned in their youth, betake themselves to other performances,
and by way of excusing their own sloth, begin to find fault with the trade as unprofitable.”
Then Simon: “Ought all who hear to believe that whatever they hear is true?”
Then Peter: “Whoever hears an orderly statement of the truth, cannot by any means gainsay
it, but knows that what is spoken is true, provided he also willingly submit to the rules of
life. But those who, when they hear, are unwilling to betake themselves to good works, are
prevented by the desire of doing evil from acquiescing in those things which they judge to
be right. Hence it is manifest that it is in the power of the hearers to choose which of the
two they prefer. But if all who hear were to obey, it would be rather a necessity of nature,
leading all in one way. For as no one can be persuaded to become shorter or taller, because
the force of nature does not permit it; so also, if either all were converted to the truth by a
word, or all were not converted, it would be the force of nature which compelled all in the
one case, and none at all in the other, to be converted.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—God Righteous as Well as Good.</head>
<p>Then said Simon: “Inform us, therefore, what he who desires to know the truth must
first learn.” Then Peter: “Before all things it must be inquired what it is possible for man
to find out. For of necessity the judgment of God turns upon this, if a man was able to do
good and did it not. And therefore men must inquire whether they have it in their power
by seeking to find what is good, and to do it when they have found it; for this is that for
which they are to be judged. But more than this there is no occasion for any one but a
prophet to know: for what is the need for men to know how the world was made? This,
indeed, would be necessary to be learned if we had to enter upon a similar construction.
But now it is sufficient for us, in order to the worship of God, to know that He made the
world; but how He made it is no subject of inquiry for us, because, as I have said, it is not
incumbent upon us to acquire the knowledge of that art, as though we were about to make
something similar. But neither are we to be judged for this, why we have not learned how
the world was made, but only for that, if we be without knowledge of its Creator. For we
shall know that the Creator of the world is the righteous and good God, if we seek Him in
the paths of righteousness. For if we only know regarding Him that He is good, such
knowledge is not sufficient for salvation. For in the present life not only the worthy, but
also the unworthy, enjoy His goodness and His benefits. But if we believe Him to be not
only good, but also righteous, and if, according to what we believe concerning God, we observe
righteousness in the whole course of our life, we shall enjoy His goodness for ever.
In a word, to the Hebrews, whose opinion concerning God was that He is only good, our
Master said that they should seek also His righteousness;690 that is, that they should know
that He is good indeed in this present time, that all may live in His goodness, but that He
shall be righteous at the day of judgment, to bestow eternal rewards upon the worthy, from
which the unworthy shall be excluded.</p>

<p>Then Simon: “How can one and the same being be both good and righteous?”691 Peter
answered: “Because without righteousness, goodness would be unrighteousness; for it is
the part of a good God to bestow His sunshine and rain equally on the just and the unjust;692
but this would seem to be unjust, if He treated the good and the bad always with equal fortune,
and were it not that He does it for the sake of the fruits, which all may equally enjoy
who are born in this world. But as the rain given by God equally nourishes the corn and
the tares, but at the time of harvest the crops are gathered into the barn, but the chaff or the
tares are burnt in the fire,693 so in the day of judgment, when the righteous shall be introduced
into the kingdom of heaven, and the unrighteous shall be cast out, then also the justice
of God shall be shown. For if He remained for ever alike to the evil and the good, this would
not only not be good, but even unrighteous and unjust; that the righteous and the unrighteous
should be held by Him in one order of desert.”</p>

<p>Then said Simon: “The one point on which I should wish to be satisfied is, whether the
soul is immortal; for I cannot take up the burden of righteousness unless I know first concerning
the immortality of the soul; for indeed if it is not immortal, the profession of your
preaching cannot stand.” Then said Peter: “Let us first inquire whether God is just; for if
this were ascertained, the perfect order of religion would straight-way be established.” Then
Simon: “With all your boasting of your knowledge of the order of discussion, you seem to
me now to have answered contrary to order; for when I ask you to show whether the soul
is immortal, you say that we must first inquire whether God is just.” Then said Peter: “That

while others who worship God, and maintain their life frugally with all honesty and sobriety,
die in deserted places for their observance of righteousness, so that they are not even thought
worthy of burial. Where, then, is the justice of God, if there be no immortal soul to suffer
punishment in the future for impious deeds, or enjoy rewards for piety and rectitude?”
Then Simon said: “It is this indeed that makes me incredulous, because many well-doers
perish miserably, and again many evil-doers finish long lives in happiness.”694</p>

<p>Then said Peter: “This very thing which draws you into incredulity, affords to us a
certain conviction that there shall be a judgment. For since it is certain that God is just, it
is a necessary consequence that there is another world, in which every one receiving according
to his deserts, shall prove the justice of God. But if all men were now receiving according
to their deserts, we should truly seem to be deceivers when we say that there is a judgment
to come; and therefore this very fact, that in the present life a return is not made to every
one according to his deeds, affords, to those who know that God is just, an indubitable proof
that there shall be a judgment.” Then said Simon: “Why, then, am I not persuaded of it?”
Peter: “Because you have not heard the true Prophet saying, ‘Seek first His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added to you.’695 “Then said Simon: “Pardon me if I am unwilling
to seek righteousness, before I know if the soul is immortal.” Then Peter: “You also
pardon me this one thing, because I cannot do otherwise than the Prophet of truth has instructed
me.” Then said Simon: “It is certain that you cannot assert that the soul is immortal,
and therefore you cavil, knowing that if it be proved to be mortal, the whole profession of
that religion which you are attempting to propagate will be plucked up by the roots. And
therefore, indeed, I commend your prudence, while I do not approve your persuasiveness;
for you persuade many to embrace your religion, and to submit to the restraint of pleasure,
in hope of future good things; to whom it happens that they lose the enjoyment of things
present, and are deceived with hopes of things future. For as soon as they die, their soul
shall at the same time be extinguished.”</p>

<p>But Peter, when he heard him speak thus, grinding his teeth, and rubbing his forehead
with his hand, and sighing with profound grief, said:696 “Armed with the cunning of the
old serpent, you stand forth to deceive souls; and therefore, as the serpent is more subtile
than any other beast, you profess that you are a teacher from the beginning. And again, like
the serpent you wished to introduce many gods; but now, being confuted in that, you assert
that there is no God at all. For by occasion of I know not what unknown God, you denied
that the Creator of the world is God, but asserted that He is either an evil being, or that He
has many equals, or, as we have said, that He is not God at all. And when you had been
overcome in this position, you now assert that the soul is mortal, so that men may not live
righteously and uprightly in hope of things to come. For if there be no hope for the future,
why should not mercy be given up, and men indulge in luxury and pleasures, from which
it is manifest that all unrighteousness springs? And while you introduce so impious a doctrine
into the miserable life of men, you call yourself pious, and me impious, because, under the
hope of future good things, I will not suffer men to take up arms and fight against one another,
plunder and subvert everything, and attempt whatsoever lust may dictate. And what
will be the condition of that life which you would introduce, that men will attack and be
attacked, be enraged and disturbed, and live always in fear? For those who do evil to others
must expect like evil to themselves. Do you see that you are a leader of disturbance and not
of peace, of iniquity and not of equity? But I feigned anger, not because I could not prove
that the soul is immortal, but because I pity the souls which you are endeavouring to deceive.
I shall speak, therefore, but not as compelled by you; for I know how I should speak; and
you will be the only one who wants not so much persuasion as admonition on this subject.
But those who are really ignorant of this, I shall instruct as is suitable.”</p>

liberty, and need not use any special pretext. For all have heard you speaking all amiss, and
have perceived that you can prove nothing, but that you only asked questions for the sake
of contradiction; which any one can do. For what difficulty is there in replying, after the
clearest proofs have been adduced, ‘You have said nothing to the purpose?’ But that you
may know that I am able to prove to you in a single sentence that the soul is immortal, I
shall ask you with respect to a point which all know; answer me, and I shall prove to you in

anger of Peter, a pretext for departing, stopped on account of the remarkable promise that

in purple; ask him, and he will inform you either by hearing or seeing. For what need is

bloodless; for he was afraid, if he denied it, that his house would be searched, or that Peter
in his indignation would betray him more openly, and so all would learn what he was. Thus
he answered: “I beseech thee, Peter, by that good God who is in thee, to overcome the
wickedness that is in me. Receive me to repentance, and you shall have me as an assistant
in your preaching. For now I have learned in very deed that you are a prophet of the true
God, and therefore you alone know the secret and hidden things of men.”698 Then said
Peter: “You see, brethren, Simon seeking repentance; in a little while you shall see him returning
again to his infidelity. For, thinking that I am a prophet, forasmuch as I have disclosed
his wickedness, which he supposed to be secret and hidden, he has promised that he
will repent. But it is not lawful for me to lie, nor must I deceive, whether this infidel be
saved or not saved. For I call heaven and earth to witness, that I spoke not by a prophetic
spirit what I said, and what I intimated, as far as was possible, to the listening crowds; but
I learned from some who once were his associates in his works, but have now been converted
to our faith, what things he did in secret. Therefore I spoke what I knew, not what I
foreknew.”</p>

<p>But when Simon heard this, he assailed Peter with curses and reproaches, saying: “Oh

But I sought repentance not for defect of knowledge, but in order that you, thinking that
by repentance I should become your disciple, might entrust to me all the secrets of your
profession, and so at length, knowing them all, I might confute you. But as you cunningly
understood for what reason I had pretended penitence, and acquiesced as if you did not
understand my stratagem, that you might first expose me in presence of the people as unskilful,
then foreseeing that being thus exposed to the people, I must of necessity be indignant,
and confess that I was not truly penitent, you anticipated me, that you might say, that I
should, after my penitence, again return to my infidelity, that you might seem to have
conquered on all sides, both if I continued in the penitence which I had professed, and if I
did not continue; and so you should be believed to be wise, because you had foreseen these
things, while I should seem to be deceived, because I did not foresee your trick. But you
foreseeing mine, have used subtlety and circumvented me. But, as I said, your victory is the
result of fortune, not of truth: yet I know why I did not foresee this; because I stood by you

<p>Then the people in indignation cast Simon from the court, and drove him forth from

silence being obtained, Peter began to address the people in this manner: “You ought,
brethren, to bear with wicked men patiently; knowing that although God could cut them
off, yet He suffers them to remain even till the day appointed, in which judgment shall pass
upon all. Why then should not we bear with those whom God suffers? Why should not we
bear with fortitude the wrongs that they do to us, when He who is almighty does not take
vengeance on them, that both His own goodness and the impiety of the wicked may be
known? But if the wicked one had not found Simon to be his minister, he would doubtless
have found another: for it is of necessity that in this life offences come, ‘but woe to that
man by whom they come;’701 and therefore Simon is rather to be mourned over, because
he has become a choice vessel for the wicked one, which undoubtedly would not have
happened had he not received power over him for his former sins. For why should I further
say that he once believed in our Jesus, and was persuaded that souls are immortal?702 Although
in this he is deluded by demons, yet he has persuaded himself that he has the soul
of a murdered boy ministering to him in whatever he pleases to employ it in; in which truly,
as I have said, he is deluded by demons, and therefore I spoke to him according to his own
ideas: for he has learned from the Jews, that judgment and vengeance are to be brought
forth against those who set themselves against the true faith, and do not repent. But here
are men to whom, as being perfect in crimes, the wicked one appears, that he may deceive
them, so that they may never be turned to repentance.</p>

covered with silence, and are not made known to us, are cured with difficulty, like maladies
of long standing; and therefore, since the medicine of seasonable and necessary discourse
cannot easily be applied to those who keep silence, every one ought to declare in what respect
his mind is feeble through ignorance. But to him who keeps silence, it belongs to God alone
to give a remedy. We indeed also can do it, but by the lapse of a long time. For it is necessary
than the discourse of doctrine, proceeding in order from the beginning, and meeting each
single question, should disclose all things, and resolve and reach to all things, even to that
which every one required in his mind; but that, as I have said, can only be done in the course

<p>Then Niceta said: “I give you abundant thanks, O most clement Peter; but this is what
I desire to learn, how Simon, who is the enemy of God, is able to do such and so great things?
For indeed he told no lie in his declaration of what he has done.” To this the blessed Peter
thus answered: “God, who is one and true, has resolved to prepare good and faithful friends
for His first begotten; but knowing that none can be good, unless they have in their power
that perception by which they may become good, that they may be of their own intent what
they choose to be,—and otherwise they could not be truly good, if they were kept in goodness
not by purpose, but by necessity,—has given to every one the power of his own will, that he
may be what he wishes to be. And again, foreseeing that that power of will would make
some choose good things and others evil, and so that the human race would necessarily be
divided into two classes, He has permitted each class to choose both a place and a king,
whom they would. For the good King rejoices in the good, and the wicked one in the evil.
And although I have expounded those things more fully to you, O Clement, in that treatise
in which I discoursed on predestination and the end, yet it is fitting that I should now make

whom will that man not be an enemy, who cannot be a friend to himself? In order, therefore,
that there might be a distinction between those who choose good and those who choose
evil, God has concealed that which is profitable to men, i.e., the possession of the kingdom
of heaven, and has laid it up and hidden it as a secret treasure, so that no one can easily attain
it by his own power or knowledge. Yet He has brought the report of it, under various names
and opinions, through successive generations, to the hearing of all: so that whosoever should
be lovers of good, hearing it, might inquire and discover what is profitable and salutary to
them; but that they should ask it, not from themselves, but from Him who has hidden it,
and should pray that access and the way of knowledge might be given to them: which way
is opened to those only who love it above all the good things of this world; and on no other
condition can any one even understand it, however wise he may seem; but that those who

loves this possession of the kingdom of heaven, will undoubtedly cast away all practice of
evil habit, negligence, sloth, malice, anger, and such like. For if you prefer any of these to
it, as loving the vices of your own lust more than God, you shall not attain to the possession
of the heavenly kingdom; for truly it is foolish to love anything more than God. For
whether they be parents, they die; or relatives, they do not continue; or friends, they change.
But God alone is eternal, and abideth unchangeable. He, therefore, who will not seek after
that which is profitable to himself, is evil, to such an extent that his wickedness exceeds the
very prince of impiety. For he abuses the goodness of God to the purpose of his own

one, and those who by study of their own profit seek to please the good One, ten things have
been prescribed as a test to this present age, according to the number of the ten plagues
which were brought upon Egypt. For when Moses, according to the commandment of God,
demanded of Pharaoh that he should let the people go, and in token of his heavenly commission
showed signs, his rod being thrown upon the ground was turned into a serpent.703
And when Pharaoh could not by these means be brought to consent, as having freedom of
will, again the magicians seemed to do similar signs, by permission of God, that the purpose
of the king might be proved from the freedom of his will, whether he would rather believe
the signs wrought by Moses, who was sent by God, or those which the magicians rather
seemed to work than actually wrought. For truly he ought to have understood from their
very name that they were not workers of truth, because they were not called messengers of
God, but magicians, as the tradition also intimates. Moreover, they seemed to maintain the
contest up to a certain point, and afterwards they confessed of themselves, and yielded to
their superior.704 Therefore the last plague is inflicted,705 the destruction of the first-born,

that the magicians wrought their signs by divine commission? For I should not have thought
it likely that the same things could be effected by magicians, even in appearance, which he
who was sent by God performed. And now, in what respect do they sin who believe Simon,
since they see him do so great marvels? Or is it not marvellous to fly through the air, to be
so mixed with fire as to become one body with it, to make statues walk, brazen dogs bark,
and other such like things, which assuredly are sufficiently wonderful to those who know
not how to distinguish? Yea, he has also been seen to make bread of stones. But if he sins
who believes those who do signs, how shall it appear that he also does not sin who has believed
our Lord for His signs and works of power?”</p>

<p>Then said Peter: “I take it well that you bring the truth to the rule, and do not suffer
hindrances of faith to lurk in your soul. For thus you can easily obtain the remedy. Do you
remember that I said, that the worst of all things is when any one neglects to learn what is
for his good?” Niceta answered: “I remember.” Then Peter: “And again, that God has
veiled His truth, that He may disclose it to those who faithfully follow Him?” “Neither,”
said Niceta, “have I forgotten this.” Then said Peter: “What think you then? That God has
buried His truth deep in the earth, and has heaped mountains upon it, that it may be found
by those only who are able to dig down into the depths? It is not so; but as He has surrounded
the mountains and the earth with the expanse of heaven, so hath He veiled the truth with
the curtain of His own love, that he alone may be able to reach it, who has first knocked at
the gate of divine love.</p>

<head>Chapter LIX.—Good and Evil in Pairs.</head>
<p>“For, as I was beginning to say,706 God has appointed for this world certain pairs; and
he who comes first of the pairs is of evil, he who comes second, of good. And in this is given
to every man an occasion of right judgment, whether he is simple or prudent. For if he is
simple, and believes him who comes first, though moved thereto by signs and prodigies, he
must of necessity, for the same reason, believe him who comes second; for he will be persuaded
by signs and prodigies, as he was before. When he believes this second one, he will
learn from him that he ought not to believe the first, who comes of evil; and so the error of
the former is corrected by the emendation of the latter. But if he will not receive the second,
because he has believed the first, he will deservedly be condemned as unjust; for unjust it
is, that when he believed the first on account of his signs, he will not believe the second,
though he bring the same, or even greater signs. But if he has not believed the first, it follows
that he may be moved to believe the second. For his mind has not become so completely
inactive but that it may be roused by the redoubling of marvels. But if he is prudent, he can
make distinction of the signs. And if indeed he has believed in the first, he will be moved
to the second by the increase in the miracles, and by comparison he will apprehend which
are better; although clear tests of miracles are recognised by all learned men, as we have
shown in the regular order of our discussion. But if any one, as being whole and not needing
a physician, is not moved to the first, he will be drawn to the second by the very continuance
of the thing, and will make a distinction of signs and marvels after this fashion;—he who is
of the evil one, the signs that he works do good to no one; but those which the good man
worketh are profitable to men.”</p>

<p>“For tell me, I pray you, what is the use of showing statues walking, dogs of brass or
stone barking, mountains dancing, of flying through the air, and such like things, which
you say that Simon did? But those signs which are of the good One, are directed to the advantage
of men, as are those which were done by our Lord, who gave sight to the blind and
hearing to the deaf, raised up the feeble and the lame, drove away sicknesses and demons,
raised the dead, and did other like things, as you see also that I do. Those signs, therefore,
which make for the benefit of men, and confer some good upon them, the wicked one cannot
do, excepting only at the end of the world. For then it shall be permitted him to mix up
with his signs some good ones, as the expelling of demons or the healing of diseases; by this
means going beyond his bounds, and being divided against himself, and fighting against
himself, he shall be destroyed. And therefore the Lord has foretold, that in the last times
there shall be such temptation, that, if it be possible, the very elect shall be deceived; that is
to say, that by the marks of signs being confused, even those must be disturbed who seem
to be expert in discovering spirits and distinguishing miracles.</p>

Noah; the third, Pharaoh and Abraham; the fourth, the Philistines and Isaac; the fifth, Esau

the Son of man; the eighth, Simon and I, Peter; the ninth, all nations, and he who shall be
sent to sow the word among the nations; the tenth, Antichrist and Christ. Concerning these

into every particular, except him who loves his own soul to salvation, and renounces all the
affairs of this world, that he may have leisure to attend to the word of God only? Such is he
whom alone the true Prophet deems wise, even he who sells all that he has and buys the one
true pearl,708 who understands what is the difference between temporal things and eternal,
small and great, men and God. For he understands what is the eternal hope in presence of
the true and good God. But who is he that loves God, save him who knows His wisdom?
And how can any one obtain knowledge of God’s wisdom, unless he be constant in hearing
His word? Whence it comes, that he conceives a love for Him, and venerates Him with
worthy honour, pouring out hymns and prayers to Him, and most pleasantly resting in
these, accounteth it his greatest damage if at any time he speak or do aught else even for a
moment of time; because, in reality, the soul which is filled with the love of God can neither
look upon anything except what pertains to God, nor, by reason of love of Him, can be satisfied
with meditating upon those things which it knows to be pleasing to Him. But those
who have not conceived affection for Him, nor bear His love lighted up in their mind, are
as it were placed in darkness and cannot see light; and therefore, even before they begin to
learn anything of God, they immediately faint as though worn out by labour; and filled with
weariness, they are straightway hurried by their own peculiar habits to those words with
which they are pleased. For it is wearisome and annoying to such persons to hear anything
about God; and that for the reason I have stated, because their mind has received no
sweetness of divine love.”</p>

<head>Chapter LXIII.—A Deserter from Simon’s Camp.</head>
<p>While Peter was thus speaking, the day dawned; and, behold, one of the disciples of Simon
came, crying out:709 “I beseech thee, O Peter, receive me, a wretch, who have been
deceived by Simon the magician, to whom I gave heed as to a heavenly God, by reason of
those miracles which I saw him perform. But when I heard your discourses, I began to think
him a man, and indeed a wicked man; nevertheless, when he went out from this I alone
followed him, for I had not yet clearly perceived his impieties. But when he saw me following
him, he called me blessed, and led me to his house; and about the middle of the night he
said to me, ‘I shall make you better than all men, if you will remain with me even till the
end.’ When I had promised him this, he demanded of me an oath of perseverance; and
having got this, he placed upon my shoulders some of his polluted and accursed secret
things, that I might carry them, and ordered me to follow him. But when we came to the
sea, he went aboard a boat which happened to be there, and took from my neck what he
had ordered me to carry. And as he came out a little after, bringing nothing with him, he
must have thrown it into the sea. Then he asked me to go with him, saying that he was going
to Rome, and that there he would please the people so much, that he should be reckoned a
god, and publicly gifted with divine honours. ‘Then,’ said he, ‘if you wish to return hither,
I shall send you back, loaded with all riches, and upheld by various services.’ When I heard
this, and saw nothing in him in accordance with this profession, but perceived that he was
a magician and a deceiver, I answered: ‘Pardon me, I pray you; for I have a pain in my feet,
and therefore I am not able to leave Cæsarea. Besides, I have a wife and little children, whom
I cannot leave by any means.’ When he heard this, he charged me with sloth, and set out
towards Dora, saying, ‘You will be sorry, when you hear what glory I shall get in the city of
Rome.’ And after this he set out for Rome, as he said; but I hastily returned hither, entreating
you to receive me to penitence, because I have been deceived by him.”</p>

<p>When he who had returned from Simon had thus spoken, Peter ordered him to sit down
in the court. And he himself going forth, and seeing immense crowds, far more than on
the previous days, stood in his usual place; and pointing out him who had come, began to
discourse as follows: “This man whom I point out to you, brethren, has just come to me,
telling me of the wicked practices of Simon, and how he has thrown the implements of his
wickedness into the sea, not induced to do so by repentance, but being afraid lest, being
detected, he should be subjected to the public laws. And he asked this man, as he tells me,
to remain with him, promising him immense gifts; and when he could not persuade him
to do so, he left him, reproaching him for sluggishness, and set out for Rome.” When Peter
had intimated this to the crowd, the man himself who had returned from Simon stood up,
and began to state to the people everything relating to Simon’s crimes. And when they were
shocked by the things which they heard that Simon had done by his magical acts, Peter
said:710</p>

<head>Chapter LXV.—Peter Resolves to Follow Simon.</head>
<p>“Be not, my brethren, distressed by those things that have been done, but give heed to
the future: for what is passed is ended; but the things which threaten are dangerous to those
who shall fall in with them. For offences shall never be wanting in this world,711 so long as
the enemy is permitted to act according to his will; in order that the prudent and those who
understood his wiles may be conquerors in the contests which he raises against them; but
that those who neglect to learn the things that pertain to the salvation of their souls, may
be taken by him with merited deceptions. Since, therefore, as you have heard, Simon has
gone forth to preoccupy the ears of the Gentiles who are called to salvation, it is necessary
that I also follow upon his track, so that whatever disputations he raises may be corrected
by us. But inasmuch as it is right that greater anxiety should be felt concerning you who
are already received within the walls of life,—for if that which has been actually acquired
perish, a positive loss is sustained; while with respect to that which has not yet been acquired,
if it can be got, there is so much gain; but if not, the only loss is that there is no gain;—in
order, therefore, that you may be more and more confirmed in the truth, and the nations
who are called to salvation may in no way be prevented by the wickedness of Simon, I have
thought good to ordain Zacchæus as pastor over you,712 and to remain with you myself for
three months; and so to go to the Gentiles, lest through our delaying longer, and the crimes
of Simon stalking in every direction, they should become incurable.”</p>

<p>At this announcement all the people wept, hearing that he was going to leave them; and
Peter, sympathizing with them, himself also shed tears; and looking up to heaven, he said:
“To Thee, O God, who hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, we pour
out the prayer of supplication, that Thou wouldest comfort those who have recourse to Thee
in their tribulation. For by reason of the affection that they have towards Thee, they do love
me who have declared to them Thy truth. Wherefore guard them with the right hand of
Thy compassion; for neither Zacchæus nor any other man can be a sufficient guardian to
them.” When he had said this, and more to the same effect, he laid his hands upon Zacchæus,
and prayed that he might blamelessly discharge the duty of his bishopric. Then he ordained
twelve presbyters and four deacons, and said: “I have ordained you this Zacchæus as a
bishop, knowing that he has the fear of God, and is expert in the Scriptures. You ought
therefore to honour him as holding the place of Christ, obeying him for your salvation, and
knowing that whatever honour and whatever injury is done to him, redounds to Christ, and
from Christ to God. Hear him therefore with all attention, and receive from him the doctrine
of the faith; and from the presbyters the monitions of life; and from the deacons the order
of discipline. Have a religious care of widows; vigorously assist orphans; take pity on the
poor; teach the young modesty;—and in a word, sustain one another as circumstances shall
demand; worship God, who created heaven and earth; believe in Christ; love one another;

<p>When he had given them these and such like precepts, he made proclamation to the

let him be baptized; that, stripped of his former evils, he may for the future, in consequence
of his own conduct, become heir of heavenly blessings, as a reward for his good actions.
Whosoever will, then, let him come to Zacchæus and give his name to him, and let him hear
from him the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. Let him attend to frequent fastings, and
approve himself in all things, that at the end of these three months he may be baptized on
the day of the festival. But every one of you shall be baptized in ever flowing waters, the
name of the Trine Beatitude being invoked over him; he being first anointed with oil sanctified
by prayer, that so at length, being consecrated by these things, he may attain a perception
of holy things.”713</p>

<head>Chapter LXVIII.—Twelve Sent Before Him.</head>
<p>And when he had spoken at length on the subject of baptism, he dismissed the crowd,
and betook himself to his usual place of abode; and there, while the twelve stood around
him (viz. Zacchæus and Sophonias, Joseph and Michæus, Eleazar and Phineas, Lazarus and
Eliseus, I Clement and Nicodemus, Niceta and Aquila), he addressed us to the following
effect: “Let us, my brethren, consider what is right; for it is our duty to bring some help to
the nations, which are called to salvation. You have yourselves heard that Simon has set
out, wishing to anticipate our journey. Him we should have followed step by step, that
wheresoever he tries to subvert any, we might immediately confute him. But since it appears
to me to be unjust to forsake those who have been already converted to God, and to bestow
our care upon those who are still afar off, I think it right that I should remain three months
with those in this city who have been turned to the faith, and should strengthen them; and
yet that we should not neglect those who are still far off, lest haply, if they be long infected
with the power of pernicious doctrine, it be more difficult to recover them. Therefore I
wish (only, however, if you also think it right), that for Zacchæus, whom we have now ordained
bishop, Benjamin the son of Saba be substituted; and for Clement (whom I have resolved
to have always by me, because, coming from the Gentiles, he has a great desire to
hear the word of God) there be substituted Ananias the son of Safra; and for Niceta and
Aquila, who have been but lately converted to the faith of Christ, Rubelus the brother of
Zacchæus, and Zacharias the builder. I wish, therefore, to complete the number of twelve
by substituting these four for the other four, that Simon may feel that I in them am always
with him.”714</p>

<p>Having therefore separated me, Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, he said to those twelve:
“I wish you the day after to-morrow to proceed to the Gentiles, and to follow in the footsteps
of Simon, that you may inform me of all his proceedings. You will also inquire diligently
the sentiments of every one, and announce to them that I shall come to them without delay;
and, in short, in all places instruct the Gentiles to expect my coming.” When he had spoken
these things, and others to the same effect, he said: “You also, my brethren, if you have
anything to say to these things, say on, lest haply it be not right which seems good to me
alone.” Then all, with one voice applauding him, said: “We ask you rather to arrange
everything according to your own judgment, and to order what seems good to yourself; for
this we think to be the perfect work of piety, if we fulfil what you command.”</p>

privilege of hearing you for three months; but since it is good for us to do what you order,
we shall most readily obey. We shall always retain in our hearts the remembrance of your
face; and so we set out actively, as you have commanded us.” Then he, having poured out
a prayer to the Lord for them, dismissed them. And when those twelve who had been sent
forward had gone, Peter entered, according to custom, and stood in the place of disputation.
And a multitude of people had come together, even a larger number than usual; and all with
tears gazed upon him, by reason of what they had heard from him the day before, that he
was about to go forth on account of Simon. Then, seeing them weeping, he himself also
was similarly affected, although he endeavoured to conceal and to restrain his tears. But
the trembling of his voice, and the interruption of his discourse, betrayed that he was distressed

will alone is to be fulfilled and to be preferred in all things. For let us suppose for a moment,
that by reason of the affection that we have towards you, we should act against His will, and
remain with you, is He not able, by sending death upon me, to appoint to me a longer separation
from you? And therefore it is better for us to carry out this shorter separation with
His will, as those to whom it is prescribed to obey God in all things. Hence you also ought
to obey Him with like submission, inasmuch as you love me from no other reason than on
account of your love of Him. As friends of God, therefore, acquiesce in His will; but also
judge yourselves what is right. Would it not have seemed wicked, if, when Simon was deceiving
you, I had been detained by the brethren in Jerusalem, and had not come to you,
and that although you had Zacchæus among you, a good and eloquent man? So now also
consider that it would be wicked, if, when Simon has gone forth to assail the Gentiles, who
are wholly without a defender, I should be detained by you, and should not follow him.
Wherefore let us see to it, that we do not, by an unreasonable affection, accomplish the will

a hearing. For he asserted that Peter was a magician, a godless man, injurious, cunning,
ignorant, and professing impossible things. “For,” says he, “he asserts that the dead shall
rise again, which is impossible. But if any one attempts to confute him, he is cut off by secret
snares by him, through means of his attendants. Wherefore, I also,” says he, “when I had
vanquished him and triumphed over him, fled for fear of his snares, lest he should destroy
me by incantations, or compass my death by plots.” They intimated also that he mainly
stayed at Tripolis.715</p>

therefore be urged in support of the new view of Lehmann (Die Clementinischen Schriften, Gotha, 1869), that
the Recognitions are made up of two parts (books i.–iii., iv.–x.) by two different authors, both parts being based
on earlier documents. This chapter is regarded by Hilgenfeld as containing a general outline of the Kerygma
Petri, a Jewish-Christian document of Roman origin. In i. 27–72 he finds a remnant of this document incorporated

<head>Chapter I.—Halt at Dora.</head>
<p>Having set out from Cæsarea on the way to Tripolis, we made our first stoppage at a
small town called Dora, because it was not far distant; and almost all those who had believed
through the preaching of Peter could scarcely bear to be separated from him, but walked
along with us, again and again gazing upon him, again and again embracing him, again and
again conversing with him, until we came to the inn. On the following day we came to
Ptolemais, where we stayed ten days; and when a considerable number had received the
word of God, we signified to some of them who seemed particularly attentive, and wished
to detain us longer for the sake of instruction, that they might, if so disposed, follow us to
Tripolis. We acted in the same way at Tyre, and Sidon, and Berytus, and announced to
those who desired to hear further discourses, that we were to spend the winter at Tripolis.718
Therefore, as all those who were anxious followed Peter from each city, we were a great
multitude of elect ones when we entered into Tripolis. On our arrival, the brethren who
had been sent before met us before the gates of the city; and taking us under their charge,
conducted us to the various lodgings which they had prepared. Then there arose a commo-
tion in the city, and a great assemblage of persons desirous to see Peter.719</p>
<note type="footnote">718 [In books iv.–vi. the scene is laid at Tripolis. The same city is the locality to which Homilies VIII.–XI.
are assigned. The intervening portion (Homilies IV.–VII.) gives the details of the journey here alluded to, telling
of various discourses at Tyre. Some of the matter of these discourses occurs in the Recognitions, but under different
circumstances. The heathen disputants are not the same. The parallelisms of the portions assigned to
Tripolis are as follows: book iv. has its counterpart in Homily VIII. and in much of Homily IX.; book v. has a
parallel in Homily X. and it, parts of XI.; book vi. in its general outline resembles Homily XI. The discourses of
the Apostle as given in the Recognitions are more orderly and logical than those in the Homilies. The views
presented differ somewhat, in accordance with the general character of the two works. Much of the matter in
the Recognitions occurs in a different order in the Homilies, but the internal evidence seems to point to the priority
of the former. Both might be different manipulations of a common documentary source, but that theory
is not necessarily applicable to these portions of the literature.—R.]</note>

<head>Chapter II.—Reception in the House of Maro.</head>
<p>And when we had come to the house of Maro, in which preparation had been made for
Peter, he turned to the crowd, and told them that he would address them the day after tomorrow.
Therefore the brethren who had been sent before assigned lodgings to all who had
come with us. Then, when Peter had entered into the house of Maro, and was asked to
partake of food, he answered that he would by no means do so, until he had ascertained
whether all those that had accompanied him were provided with lodgings. Then he learned
from the brethren who had been sent before, that the citizens had received them not only
hospitably, but with all kindness, by reason of their love towards Peter; so much so, that
several were disappointed because there were no guests for them; for that all had made such
preparations, that even if many more had come, there would still have been a deficiency of
guests for the hosts, not of hosts for the guests.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Simon’s Flight.</head>
<p>Thereupon Peter was greatly delighted, and praised the brethren, and blessed them, and
requested them to remain with him. Then, when he had bathed in the sea, and had taken
food, he went to sleep in the evening; and rising, as usual, at cock-crow, while the evening
light was still burning, he found us all awake. Now there were in all sixteen of us, viz. Peter
and I, Clement, Niceta and Aquila, and those twelve who had preceded us.720 Saluting us,
then, as was his wont, Peter said: “Since we are not taken up with others to-day, let us be
taken up with ourselves. I shall tell you what took place at Cæsarea after your departure,
and you shall tell us of the doings of Simon here.” And while the conversation was going
on on these subjects, at daybreak some of the members of the family came in and told Peter
that Simon, when he heard of Peter’s arrival, departed in the night, on the way to Syria.
They also stated that the crowds thought that the day which he had said was to intervene
was a very long time for their affection, and that they were standing in impatience before
the gate, conversing among themselves about those things which they wished to hear, and
that they hoped that they should by all means see him before the time appointed; and that
as the day became lighter the multitudes were increasing, and that they were trusting confidently,
whatever they might be presuming upon, that they should hear a discourse from
him. “Now then,” said they, “instruct us to tell them what seems good to you; for it is absurd
that so great a multitude should have come together, and should depart with sadness, through
no answer being returned to them. For they will not consider that it is they that have not
waited for the appointed day but rather they will think that you are slighting them.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Harvest Plenteous.</head>
<p>Then Peter, filled with admiration, said:721 “You see, brethren, how every word of the
Lord spoken prophetically is fulfilled. For I remember that He said, ‘The harvest indeed is
plenteous, but the labourers are few; ask therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would
send out labourers into His harvest.’722 Behold, therefore, the things which are foretold in
a mystery are fulfilled. But whereas He said also, ‘Many shall come from the east and the
west, from the north and the south, and shall recline in the bosom of Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob;’723 this also is, as you see, in like manner fulfilled. Wherefore I entreat you, my
fellow-servants and helpers, that you would learn diligently the order of preaching, and the
ways of absolutions, that ye may be able to save the souls of men, which by the secret power
of God acknowledge whom they ought to love, even before they are taught. For you see
that these men, like good servants, long for him whom they expect to announce to them the
coming of their Lord, that they may be able to fulfil His will when they have learned it. The
desire, therefore, of hearing the word of God, and inquiring into His will, they have from
God; and this is the beginning of the gift of God, which is given to the Gentiles, that by this
they may be able to receive the doctrine of truth.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Moses and Christ.</head>
<p>“For so also it was given to the people of the Hebrews from the beginning, that they
should love Moses, and believe his word; whence also it is written: ‘The people believed
God, and Moses His servant.’724 What, therefore, was of peculiar gift from God toward the
nation of the Hebrews, we see now to be given also to those who are called from among the
Gentiles to the faith. But the method of works is put into the power and will of every one,
and this is their own; but to have an affection towards a teacher of truth, this is a gift of the
heavenly Father. But salvation is in this, that you do His will of whom you have conceived
a love and affection through the gift of God; lest that saying of His be addressed to you which
He spoke, ‘Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?’725 It is therefore the peculiar
gift bestowed by God upon the Hebrews, that they believe Moses; and the peculiar gift bestowed
upon the Gentiles is that they love Jesus. For this also the Master intimated, when
He said, ‘I will confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast
concealed these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.’726 By
which it is certainly declared, that the people of the Hebrews, who were instructed out of
the law, did not know Him; but the people of the Gentiles have acknowledged Jesus, and
venerate Him; on which account also they shall be saved, not only acknowledging Him, but
also doing His will. But he who is of the Gentiles, and who has it of God to believe Moses,
ought also to have it of his own purpose to love Jesus also. And again, the Hebrew, who has
it of God to believe Moses, ought to have it also of his own purpose to believe in Jesus; so
that each of them, having in himself something of the divine gift, and something of his own
exertion, may be perfect by both. For concerning such an one our Lord spoke, as of a rich
man, ‘Who brings forth from his treasures things new and old.’727</p>

<p>“But enough has been said of these things for time presses, and the religious devotion

there was a suitable place for discussion. And Maro said: “I have a very spacious hall728
which can hold more than five hundred men, and there is also a garden within the house;
or if it please you to be in some public place, all would prefer it, for there is nobody who
does not desire at least to see your face.” Then Peter said: “Show me the hall, or the garden.”
And when he had seen the hall, he went in to see the garden also; and suddenly the whole
multitude, as if some one had called them, rushed into the house, and thence broke through
into the garden, where Peter was already standing, selecting a fit place for discussion.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Sick Healed.</head>
<p>But when he saw that the crowds had, like the waters of a great river, poured over the
narrow passage, he mounted upon a pillar which happened to stand near the wall of the
garden, and first saluted the people in a religious manner. But some of those who were
present, and who had been for a long time distressed by demons, threw themselves on the
ground, while the unclean spirits entreated that they might be allowed but for one day to
remain in the bodies that they had taken possession of. But Peter rebuked them, and commanded
them to depart; and they went out without delay. After these, others who had been
afflicted with long-standing sicknesses asked Peter that they might receive healing; and he
promised that he would entreat the Lord for them as soon as his discourse of instruction
was completed. But as soon as he promised, they were freed from their sicknesses;729 and
he ordered them to sit down apart, with those who had been freed from the demons, as after
the fatigue of labour. Meantime, while this was going on, a vast multitude assembled, attracted
not only by the desire of hearing Peter, but also by the report of the cures which had
been accomplished. But Peter, beckoning with his hand to the people to be still, and settling
the crowds in tranquillity, began to address them as follows:—</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Providence Vindicated.</head>
<p>“It seems to me necessary, at the outset of a discourse concerning the true worship of
God, first of all to instruct those who have not as yet acquired any knowledge of the subject,
that throughout the divine providence must be maintained to be without blame, by which
the world is ruled and governed. Moreover, the reason of the present undertaking, and the
occasion offered by those whom the power of God has healed, suggest this subject for a beginning,
viz. to show that for good reason very many persons are possessed of demons, that
so the justice of God may appear. For ignorance will be found to be the mother of almost
all evils. But now let us come to the reason.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—State of Innocence a State of Enjoyment.</head>
<p>“When God had made man after His own image and likeness, He grafted into His work
a certain breathing and odour of His divinity, that so men, being made partakers of His
Only-begotten, might through Him be also friends of God and sons of adoption. Whence
also He Himself, as the true Prophet, knowing with what actions the Father is pleased, instructed
them in what way they might obtain that privilege. At that time, therefore, there
was among men only one worship of God—a pure mind and an uncorrupted spirit. And
for this reason every creature kept an inviolable covenant with the human race. For by
reason of their reverence of the Creator, no sickness, or bodily disorder, or corruption of
food, had power over them; whence it came to pass, that a life of a thousand years did not
fall into the frailty of old age.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">

<head>Chapter X.—Sin the Cause of Suffering.</head>
<p>“But when men, leading a life void of distress, began to think that the continuance of
good things was granted them not by the divine bounty, but by the chance of things, and
to accept as a debt of nature, not as a gift of God’s goodness, their enjoyment without any
exertion of the delights of the divine complaisance,—men, being led by these things into
contrary and impious thoughts, came at last, at the instigation of idleness, to think that the
life of gods was theirs by nature, without any labours or merits on their part. Hence they
go from bad to worse, to believe that neither is the world governed by the providence of
God, nor is there any place for virtues, since they knew that they themselves possessed the
fulness of ease and delights, without the assignment of any works previously, and without
any labours were treated as the friends of God.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Suffering Salutary.</head>
<p>“By the most righteous judgment of God, therefore, labours and afflictions are assigned
as a remedy to men languishing in the vanity of such thoughts. And when labour and
tribulations came upon them, they were excluded from the place of delights and amenity.
Also the earth began to produce nothing to them without labour; and then men’s thoughts
being turned in them, they were warned to seek the aid of their Creator, and by prayers and
vows to ask for the divine protection. And thus it came to pass, that the worship of God,
which they had neglected by reason of their prosperity, they recovered through their adversity;
and their thoughts towards God, which indulgence had perverted, affliction corrected. So
therefore the divine providence, seeing that this was more profitable to man, removed from
them the ways of benignity and abundance, as being hurtful, and introduced the way of
vexation and tribulation.730</p>

the rest, who were so ungrateful that they could not be amended and corrected even by labours
and tribulations, were condemned to a terrible death. Yet amongst them also He
found a certain one, who was righteous with his house,733 whom He preserved, having enjoined
him to build an ark, in which he and those who were commanded to go with him
might escape, when all things should be destroyed by a deluge: in order that, the wicked

time, the worship of God and righteousness were corrupted by the unbelieving and the
wicked, as we shall show more fully by and by. Moreover, perverse and erratic religions
were introduced, to which the greater part of men gave themselves up, by occasion of holidays
and solemnities, instituting drinkings and banquets, following pipes, and flutes, and harps,
and diverse kinds of musical instruments, and indulging themselves in all kinds of drunkenness
and luxury. Hence every kind of error took rise; hence they invented groves and altars,
fillets and victims, and after drunkenness they were agitated as if with mad emotions. By
this means power was given to the demons to enter into minds of this sort, so that they
seemed to lead insane dances and to rave like Bacchanalians; hence were invented the
gnashing of teeth, and bellowing from the depth of their bowels; hence a terrible countenance
and a fierce aspect in men, so that he whom drunkenness had subverted and a demon had
instigated, was believed by the deceived and the erring to be filled with the Deity.</p>

tormented for ever. For God is not only good, but also just; for if He were always good, and
never just to render to every one according to his deeds, goodness would be found to be
injustice. For it were injustice if the impious and the pious were treated by Him alike.</p>

bodies of men, if they remain in them a long time through their own negligence, because
they do not seek after what is profitable to their souls, they necessarily compel them for the
future to fulfil the desires of the demons who dwell in them. But what is worst of all, at the

<p>“Now that the demons are desirous of occupying the bodies of men, this is the reason.
They are spirits having their purpose turned to wickedness. Therefore by immoderate eating
and drinking, and lust, they urge men on to sin, but only those who entertain the purpose
of sinning, who, while they seem simply desirous of satisfying the necessary cravings of
nature, give opportunity to the demons to enter into them, because through excess they do
not maintain moderation. For as long as the measure of nature is kept, and legitimate
moderation is preserved, the mercy of God does not give them liberty to enter into men.
But when either the mind falls into impiety, or the body is filled with immoderate meat or
drink, then, as if invited by the will and purpose of those who thus neglect themselves, they
receive power as against those who have broken the law imposed by God.</p>

<p>“You see, then, how important is the acknowledgment of God, and the observance of
the divine religion, which not only protects those who believe from the assaults of the demon,
but also gives them command over those who rule over others. And therefore it is necessary
for you, who are of the Gentiles, to betake yourselves to God, and to keep yourselves from
all uncleanness, that the demons may be expelled, and God may dwell in you. And at the
same time, by prayers, commit yourselves to God, and call for His aid against the impudence
of the demons; for ‘whatever things ye ask, believing, ye shall receive.’736 But even the
demons themselves, in proportion as they see faith grow in a man, in that proportion they
depart from him, residing only in that part in which something of infidelity still remains;
but from those who believe with full faith, they depart without any delay. For when a soul
has come to the faith of God, it obtains the virtue of heavenly water, by which it extinguishes
the demon like a spark of fire.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—This Power in Proportion to Faith.</head>
<p>“There is therefore a measure of faith, which, if it be perfect, drives the demon perfectly
from the soul; but if it has any defect, something on the part of the demon still remains in
the portion of infidelity; and it is the greatest difficulty for the soul to understand when or
how, whether fully or less fully, the demon has been expelled from it. For if he remains in
any quarter, when he gets an opportunity, he suggests thoughts to men’s hearts; and they,
not knowing whence they come, believe the suggestions of the demons, as if they were the
perceptions of their own souls. Thus they suggest to some to follow pleasure by occasion
of bodily necessity; they excuse the passionateness of others by excess of gall; they colour
over the madness of others by the vehemence of melancholy; and even extenuate the folly
of some as the result of abundance of phlegm. But even if this were so, still none of these
could be hurtful to the body, except from the excess of meats and drinks; because, when
these are taken in excessive quantities, their abundance, which the natural warmth is not
sufficient to digest, curdles into a sort of poison, and it, flowing through the bowels and all
the veins like a common sewer, renders the motions of the body unhealthy and base.
Wherefore moderation is to be attained in all things, that neither may place be given to
demons, nor the soul, being possessed by them, be delivered along with them to be tormented
in eternal fires.</p>

<p>“There is also another error of the demons, which they suggest to the senses of men,
that they should think that those things which they suffer, they suffer from such as are called
gods, in order that thereby, offering sacrifices and gifts, as if to propitiate them, they may
strengthen the worship of false religion, and avoid us who are interested in their salvation,
that they may be freed from error; but this they do, as I have said, not knowing that these
things are suggested to them by demons, for fear they should be saved. It is therefore in the
power of every one, since man has been made possessed of free-will, whether he shall hear
us to life, or the demons to destruction. Also to some, the demons, appearing visibly under
various figures, sometimes throw out threats, sometimes promise relief from sufferings,
that they may instil into those whom they deceive the opinion of their being gods, and that
it may not be known that they are demons. But they are not concealed from us, who know
the mysteries of the creation, and for what reason it is permitted to the demons to do those
things in the present world; how it is allowed them to transform themselves into what figures
they please, and to suggest evil thoughts, and to convey themselves, by means of meats and

that which the artificer pleased? How then can the divinity be thought to be in that which
would not be at all unless the artificer had pleased? Or how can they hope that future things
should be declared to them by that in which there is no perception of present things? For
although they should divine something, they should not straightway be held to be gods; for
divination is one thing, divinity is another. For the Pythons also seem to divine, yet they
are not gods; and, in short, they are driven out of men by Christians. And how can that be
God which is put to flight by a man? But perhaps you will say, What as to their effecting
cures, and their showing how one can be cured? On this principle, physicians ought also

<p>“Whence it is evident that they since they are demoniac spirits, know some things both
more quickly and more perfectly than men; for they are not retarded in their learning by
the heaviness of a body. And therefore they, as being spirits, know without delay and without
difficulty what physicians attain after a long time and by much labour. It is not wonderful,
therefore, if they know somewhat more than men do; but this is to be observed, that what
they know they do not employ for the salvation of souls, but for the deception of them, that
by means of it they may indoctrinate them in the worship of false religion. But God, that
the error of so great deception might not be concealed, and that He Himself might not seem
to be a cause of error in permitting them so great licence to deceive men by divinations, and
cures, and dreams, has of His mercy furnished men with a remedy, and has made the distinction
of falsehood and truth patent to those who desire to know. This, therefore, is that
distinction: what is spoken by the true God, whether by prophets or by diverse visions, is
always true; but what is foretold by demons is not always true. It is therefore an evident
sign that those things are not spoken by the true God, in which at any time there is falsehood;
for in truth there is never falsehood. But in the case of those who speak falsehoods, there
may occasionally be a slight mixture of truth, to give as it were seasoning to the falsehoods.</p>

for answer: If they had never been allowed to speak any truth, then they would not foretell
anything at all; while if they did not foretell, they would not be known to be demons. But
if demons were not known to be in this world, the cause of our struggle and contest would

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Evil Not in Substance.</head>
<p>“But if any one, proceeding more curiously, inquire: What then was the use of God’s
making these evil things, which should have so great a tendency to subvert the minds of
men?737 To one proposing such a question, we answer that we must first of all inquire
whether there is any evil in substance. And although it would be sufficient to say to him
that it is not suitable that the creature judge the Creator, but that to judge the work of another
belongs to him who is either of equal skill or equal power; yet, to come directly to the
point, we say absolutely that there is no evil in substance. But if this be so, then the Creator
of substance is vainly blamed.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Why God Permits Evil.</head>
<p>“But you will meet me by saying, Even if it has come to this through freedom of will,
was the Creator ignorant that those whom He created would fall away into evil? He ought
therefore not to have created those who, He foresaw, would deviate from the path of righteousness.
Now we tell those who ask such questions, that the purpose of assertions of the
sort made by us is to show why the wickedness of those who as yet were not, did not prevail
over the goodness of the Creator.738 For if, wishing to fill up the number and measure of
His creation, He had been afraid of the wickedness of those who were to be, and like one
who could find no other way of remedy and cure, except only this, that He should refrain
from His purpose of creating, lest the wickedness of those who were to be should be ascribed
to Him; what else would this show but unworthy suffering and unseemly feebleness on the
part of the Creator, who should so fear the actings of those who as yet were not, that He
refrained from His purposed creation?</p>
<note type="footnote">738 There is considerable variety of reading in this sentence, and the precise meaning is somewhat obscure.
The general sense, however, is sufficiently evident, that if God had refrained from creating those who He foresaw,
would fall into evil, this would have been to subject His goodness to their evil.</note>

<p>“But, setting aside these things, let us consider this earnestly, that God the Creator of
the universe, foreseeing the future differences of His creation, foresaw and provided diverse
ranks and different offices to each of His creatures, according to the peculiar movements
which were produced from freedom of will; so that while all men are of one substance in
respect of the method of creation, there should yet be diversity in ranks and offices, according
to the peculiar movements of minds, to be produced from liberty of will. Therefore He
foresaw that there would be faults in His creatures; and the method of His justice demanded
that punishment should follow faults, for the sake of amendment. It behoved, therefore,
that there should be ministers of punishment, and yet that freedom of will should draw
them into that order. Moreover, those also must have enemies to conquer, who had undertaken
the contests for the heavenly rewards. Thus, therefore, neither are those things destitute
of utility which are thought to be evil, since the conquered unwillingly acquire eternal rewards
for those by whom they are conquered. But let this suffice on these points, for in process

in this wise. Certain angels, having left the course of their proper order, began to favour

by these means they might indulge their own pleasures the more; and then, that they might

Babylonians and Persians are descended. Him the nations who then existed called
Zoroaster,741 admiring him as the first author of the magic art; under whose name also
many books on this subject exist. He therefore, being much and frequently intent upon the
stars, and wishing to be esteemed a god among them, began to draw forth, as it were, certain
sparks from the stars, and to show them to men, in order that the rude and ignorant might

Zoroaster after his death—that is, living star—by those who, after one generation, had been

that men might be turned to erratic worship, by signs among the stars, and motions brought

God rewarding your faith. For as he who has soldiers under him, although he may be inferior,
and they superior to him in strength, yet ‘says to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another,
Come, and he cometh; and to another, Do this, and he doeth it;’743 and this he is able to do,
not by his own power, but by the fear of Cæsar; so every faithful one commands the demons,
although they seem to be much stronger than men, and that not by means of his own power,
but by means of the power of God, who has put them in subjection. For even that which
we have just spoken of, that Cæsar is held in awe by all soldiers, and in every camp, and in
his whole kingdom, though he is but one man, and perhaps feeble in respect of bodily
strength, this is not effected but by the power of God, who inspires all with fear, that they

peace, tempting Him, and began to promise Him all the glory of the world; because he knew
that when he had offered this to others, for the sake of deceiving them, they had worshipped
him. Therefore, impious as he was, and unmindful of himself, which indeed is the special
peculiarity of wickedness, he presumed that he should be worshipped by Him by whom he
knew that he was to be destroyed. Therefore our Lord, confirming the worship of one God,
answered him: ‘It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve.’745 And he, terrified by this answer, and fearing lest the true religion of the one and

thence, is by any means to be received. But let neither prophet nor apostle be looked for by
you at this time, besides us. For there is one true Prophet, whose words we twelve apostles

for what reason the world itself was made, or what diversities have occurred in it, and why
our Lord, coming for its restoration, has chosen and sent us twelve apostles, shall be explained
more at length at another time. Meantime He has commanded us to go forth to preach,

things which pollute it in actions are these: murders, adulteries, hatreds, avarice, evil ambi-

to all disorders and all frailty; but when he sinned, as we taught you yesterday, and became
the servant of sin, he became at the same time liable to frailty. This therefore is written, that
men may know that, as by impiety they have been made liable to suffer, so by piety they
may be made free from suffering; and not only free from suffering, but by even a little faith
in God be able to cure the sufferings of others. For thus the true Prophet promised us, saying,
‘Verily I say to you, that if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this

nourished, and increased, and rooted in the senses of men by negligence; and if any one
teach that she is to be put to flight, she is with difficulty and indignantly torn away, as from
an ancient and hereditary abode. And therefore we must labour for a little, that we may
search out the presumptions of ignorance, and cut them off by means of knowledge, especially
in those who are preoccupied with some erroneous opinions, by means of which ignorance
is the more firmly rooted in them, as under the appearance of a certain kind of knowledge;
for nothing is worse than for one to believe that he knows what he is ignorant of, and to
maintain that to be true which is false. This is as if a drunk man should think himself to be
sober, and should act indeed in all respects as a drunk man, and yet think himself to be

<head>Chapter IX.—The Two Kingdoms.</head>
<p>“For he who persists in evil, and is the servant of evil, cannot be made a portion of good
so long as he persists in evil, because from the beginning, as we have said, God instituted
two kingdoms, and has given to each man the power of becoming a portion of that kingdom
to which he shall yield himself to obey. And since it is decreed by God that no one man can
be a servant of both kingdoms, therefore endeavour with all earnestness to betake yourselves
to the covenant and laws of the good King. Wherefore also the true Prophet, when He was
present with us, and saw some rich men negligent with respect to the worship of God, thus
unfolded the truth of this matter: ‘No one,’ said He, ‘can serve two masters; ye cannot serve
God and mammon;’755 calling riches, in the language of His country, mammon.</p>

who, standing in public places, by a simple command made the blind see, the deaf hear, cast
out demons, restored health to the sick, and life to the dead; and since nothing was impossible
to Him, He even perceived the thoughts of men, which is possible for none but God only.
He proclaimed the kingdom of God; and we believed Him as a true Prophet in all that He
spoke, deriving the confirmation of our faith not only from His words, but also from His
works; and also because the sayings of the law, which many generations before had set forth
His coming, were fulfilled in Him; and the figures of the doings of Moses, and of the patriarch
Jacob before him, bore in all respects a type of Him. It is evident also that the time of His
advent, that is, the very time at which He came, was foretold by them; and, above all, it was
contained in the sacred writings, that He was to be waited for by the Gentiles. And all these

<head>Chapter XI.—The Expectation of the Gentiles.</head>
<p>“But that which a prophet of the Jews foretold, that He was to be waited for by the
Gentiles,756 confirms above measure the faith of truth in Him. For if he had said that He
was to be waited for by the Jews, he would not have seemed to prophesy anything extraordinary,
that He whose coming had been promised for the salvation of the world should be the
object of hope to the people of the same tribe with Himself, and to His own nation: for that
this would take place, would seem rather to be a matter of natural inference than one requiring
the grandeur of a prophetic utterance. But now, whereas the prophets say that all that
hope which is set forth concerning the salvation of the world, and the newness of the kingdom
which is to be established by Christ, and all things which are declared concerning Him are
to be transferred to the Gentiles; the grandeur of the prophetic office is confirmed, not according
to the sequence of things, but by an incredible fulfilment of the prophecy. For the
Jews from the beginning had understood by a most certain tradition that this man should
at some time come, by whom all things should be restored; and daily meditating and looking
out for His coming, when they saw Him amongst them, and accomplishing the signs and
miracles, as had been written of Him, being blinded with envy, they could not recognise
Him when present, in the hope of whom they rejoiced while He was absent; yet the few of
us who were chosen by Him understood it.</p>

<p>“But I should like if those who worship idols would tell me if they wish to become like
those whom they worship? Does any one of you wish to see in such sort as they see? or to
hear after the manner of their hearing? or to have such understanding as they have? Far be
this from any of my hearers! For this were rather to be thought a curse and a reproach to
a man, who bears in himself the image of God, although he has lost the likeness. What sort
of gods, then, are they to be reckoned, the imitation of whom would be execrable to their
worshippers, and to have whose likeness would be a reproach? What then? Melt your
useless images, and make useful vessels. Melt the unserviceable and inactive metal, and
make implements fit for the use of men. But, says one, human laws do not allow us.762 He
says well; for it is human laws, and not their own power, that prevents it. What kind of
gods, then, are those which are defended by human laws, and not by their own energies?
And so also they are preserved from thieves by watch-dogs and the protection of bolts, at
least if they be of silver, or gold, or even of brass; for those that are of stone and earthenware
are protected by their own worthlessness, for no one will steal a stone or a crockery god.
Hence those seem to be the more miserable whose more precious metal exposes them to
the greater danger. Since, then, they can be stolen, since they must be guarded by men,
since they can be melted, and weighed out, and forged with hammers, ought men possessed
of understanding to hold them as gods?</p>

<p>“Oh! into what wretched plight the understanding of men has fallen! For if it is reckoned
the greatest folly to fear the dead, what shall we judge of those who fear something that is
worse than the dead are? For those images are not even to be reckoned among the number
of the dead, because they were never alive. Even the sepulchres of the dead are preferable
to them, since, although they are now dead, yet they once had life; but those whom you
worship never possessed even such base life as is in all, the life of frogs and owls. But why
say more about them, since it is enough to say to him who adores them: Do you not see
that he whom you adore sees not, hear that he whom you adore hears not, and understand
that he understands not?—for he is the work of man’s hand, and necessarily is void of understanding.
You therefore worship a god without sense, whereas every one who has sense
believes that not even those things are to be worshipped which have been made by God and
have sense,763 such as the sun, moon, and stars, and all things that are in heaven and upon
earth. For they think it reasonable, that not those things which have been made for the
service of the world, but the Creator of those things themselves, and of the whole world,
should be worshipped. For even these things rejoice when He is adored and worshipped,
and do not take it well that the honour of the Creator should be bestowed on the creature.
For the worship of God alone is acceptable to them, who alone is uncreated, and all things
also are His creatures. For as it belongs to him who alone is uncreated to be God, so
everything that has been created is not truly God.</p>

creeps through your senses; and beginning at the head, he glides through your inner marrow,
accounting the deceiving of you a great gain. Therefore he insinuates into your minds
opinions of gods of whatsoever kinds, only that he may withdraw you from the faith of one

<head>Chapter XVIII.—His First Suggestion.</head>
<p>“And first of all he suggests to men’s thoughts not to hear the words of truth, by which
they might put to flight the ignorance of those things which are evils. And this he does, as
by the presentation of another knowledge, making a show of that opinion which very many
hold, to think that they shall not be held guilty if they have been in ignorance, and that they
shall not be called to account for what they have not heard; and thereby he persuades them
to turn aside from hearing the word. But I tell you, in opposition to this, that ignorance is
in itself a most deadly poison, which is sufficient to ruin the soul without any aid from
without. And therefore there is no one who is ignorant who shall escape through his ignorance,
but it is certain that he shall perish. For the power of sin naturally destroys the sinner.
But since the judgment shall be according to reason, the cause and origin of ignorance shall
be inquired into, as well as of every sin. For he who is unwilling to know how he may attain
to life, and prefers to be in ignorance lest he thereby be made guilty, from this very fact is
judged as if he knew and had knowledge. For he knew what it was that he was unwilling to
hear; and the cunning obtained by the artifice of the serpent will avail him nothing for an
excuse, for he will have to do with Him to whom the heart is open. But that you may know
that ignorance of itself brings destruction, I assure you that when the soul departs from the
body, if it leave it in ignorance of Him by whom it was created, and from whom in this world
it obtained all things that were necessary for its uses, it is driven forth from the light of His
kingdom as ungrateful and unfaithful.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—His Second Suggestion.</head>
<p>“Again, the wicked serpent suggests another opinion to men, which many of you are in
the habit of bringing forward,—that there is, as we say, one God, who is Lord of all; but
these also, they say, are gods. For as there is one Cæsar, and he has under him many
judges,—for example, prefects, consuls, tribunes, and other officers,—in like manner we
think, that while there is one God greater than all, yet still that these gods are ordained in
this world, after the likeness of those officers of whom we have spoken, subject indeed to
that greater God, yet ruling us and the things that are in this world. In answer to this, I shall
show you how, in those very things which you propose for deception, you are confuted by
the reasons of truth. You say that God occupies the place of Cæsar, and those who are called
gods represent His judges and officers. Hold then, as you have adduced it, by the example
of Cæsar; and know that, as one of Cæsar’s judges or administrators, as prefects, proconsuls,
generals, or tribunes, may lawfully take the name of Cæsar,—or else both he who should
take it and those who should confer it should be destroyed together,—so also in this case
you ought to observe, that if any one give the name of God to any but Himself, and he accept
it, they shall partake one and the same destruction, by a much more terrible fate than the
servants of Cæsar. For he who offends against Cæsar shall undergo temporal destruction;
but he who offends against Him who is the sole and true God, shall suffer eternal punishment,
and that deservedly, as having injured by a wrongful condition the name which is unique.765
765 The writer means, that insult is offered to that name which belongs to God alone by giving it to others,

they had discovered the theory of the heavenly revolutions and the nature of the stars, nevertheless,
through the demon’s blocking up their senses, subjected the incommunicable
name to all kinds of indignity. For some taught that their ox, which is called Apis, ought

dumb animals, while they themselves are rational. But I will tell you how they also laugh
at you; for they say, We worship living animals, though mortal; but you worship and adore
things which never were alive at all. They add this also, that they are figures and allegories
of certain powers by whose help the race of men is governed. Taking refuge in this for
shame, they fabricate these and similar excuses, and so endeavour to screen their error. But
this is not the time to answer the Egyptians, and leaving the care of those who are present

<p>“But let us come back to you, whose opinion it is that God should be regarded as Cæsar,
and the gods as the ministers and deputies of Cæsar. Follow me attentively, and I shall
presently show you the lurking-places of the serpent, which lie in the crooked windings of
this argument. It ought to be regarded by all as certain and beyond doubt, that no creature
can be on a level with God, because He was made by none, but Himself made all things; nor
indeed can any one be found so irrational, as to suppose that the thing made can be compared
with the maker. If therefore the human mind, not only by reason, but even by a sort of
natural instinct, rightly holds this opinion, that that is called God to which nothing can be
compared or equalled, but which exceeds all and excels all; how can it be supposed that that
name which is believed to be above all, is rightly given to those whom you think to be employed
for the service and comfort of human life? But we shall add this also. This world
was undoubtedly made, and is corruptible, as we shall show more fully by and by; meantime
it is admitted both that it has been made and that it is corruptible. If therefore the world
cannot be called God, and rightly so, because it is corruptible, how shall parts of the world
take the name of God? For inasmuch as the whole world cannot be God, much more its
parts cannot. Therefore, if we come back to the example of Cæsar, you will see how far you
are in error. It is not lawful for any one, though a man of the same nature with him, to be
compared with Cæsar: do you think, then, that any one ought to be compared with God,
who excels all in this respect, that He was made by none, but Himself made all things? But,
indeed, you dare not give the name of Cæsar to any other, because he immediately punishes
one who offends against him; you dare give that of God to others, because He delays the
punishment of offenders against Him, in order to their repentance.</p>

<p>“Through the mouths of others also that serpent is wont to speak in this wise: We adore
visible images in honour of the invisible God.766 Now this is most certainly false. For if
you really wished to worship the image of God, you would do good to man, and so worship
the true image of God in him. For the image of God is in every man, though His likeness
is not in all, but where the soul is benign and the mind pure. If, therefore, you wish truly
to honour the image of God, we declare to you what is true, that you should do good to and
pay honour and reverence to man, who is made in the image of God; that you minister food
to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, hospitality to the stranger, and
necessary things to the prisoner; and that is what will be regarded as truly bestowed upon
God. And so far do these things go to the honour of God’s image, that he who does not
these things is regarded as casting reproach upon the divine image. What, then, is that
honour of God which consists in running from one stone or wooden figure to another, in
venerating empty and lifeless figures as deities, and despising men in whom the image of
God is of a truth? Yea, rather be assured, that whoever commits murder or adultery, or
anything that causes suffering or injury to men, in all these the image of God is violated.
For to injure men is a great impiety towards God. Whenever, therefore, you do to another
what you would not have another do to you, you defile the image of God with undeserved
distresses. Understand, therefore, that that is the suggestion of the serpent lurking within
you, which persuades you that you may seem to be pious when you worship insensible
things, and may not seem impious when you injure sensible and rational beings.</p>

this is what is suitable to be said in the meantime: If, according to you, everything that was

stars, the water, the earth, mountains, trees, stones, men; there is no one of these that ye
have not worshipped. According to your saying, therefore, none of these ought to have
been made by God, that you might not have anything that you could worship! Yea, He
ought not even to have made men themselves to be the worshippers! But this is the very
thing which that serpent which lurks within you desires: for he spares none of you; he would
have no one of you escape from destruction. But it shall not be so. For I tell you, that not

He exercises patience, because He is merciful and gracious; and He foresees that many of
the ungodly become godly, and that even some of those who worship impure statues and
polluted images have been converted to God, and forsaking their sins and doing good works,
attain to salvation. But it is said: We ought never to have come even to the thought of doing
these things. You do not know what freedom of will is, and you forget that he is good who
is so by his own intention; but, he who is retained in goodness by necessity cannot be called
good, because it is not of himself that he is so. Because, therefore, there is in every one
liberty to choose good or evil, he either acquires rewards, or brings destruction on himself.
Nay it is said, God brings to our minds whatsoever we think. What mean ye, O men? Ye
blaspheme. For if He brings all our thoughts into our minds, then it is He that suggests to
us thoughts of adultery, and covetousness, and blasphemy, and every kind of effeminacy.
Cease, I entreat of you, these blasphemies, and understand what is the honour worthy of
God. And say not, as some of you are wont to say, that God needs not honour from men.
Indeed, He truly is in need of none; but you ought to know that the honour which you bestow

him, but not cure him; and the true physician would refuse to mix his remedies with their
poisons, lest either the man’s destruction should be ascribed to the good, or his recovery,
to the injurious. But you say: Is God then indignant or envious, if, when He benefits us,
our thanks be rendered to others? Even if He be not indignant, at all events He does not
wish to be the author of error, that by means of His work credit should be given to a vain
idol. And what is so impious, so ungrateful, as to obtain a benefit from God, and to render

sun afford his light, and the other elements perform their service, to the impious. And, in
short, sometimes even in opposition to the goodness of the Creator, the elements are wearied
out by the crimes of the wicked; and thence it is that either the fruit of the earth is blighted,
or the composition of the air is vitiated, or the heat of the sun is increased beyond measure,
or there is an excessive amount of rain or of cold. Thence pestilence, and famine, and death
in various forms stalk forth, for the creature hastens to take vengeance on the wicked; yet
the goodness of God restrains it, and bridles its indignation against the wicked, and compels

melting your enmities, may reconcile you to God, that you may be converted to Him, and
may please Him by good works. For man is at enmity with God, and is in an unreasonable

<head>Chapter XXIX.—God’s Care of Human Things.</head>
<p>“But perhaps some of you will say, God has no care of human things; and if we cannot
even attain to the knowledge of Him, how shall we attain to His friendship? That God does
concern Himself with the affairs of men, His government of the world bears witness: for
the sun daily waits upon it, the showers minister to it; the fountains, rivers, winds, and all
elements, attend upon it; and the more these things become known to men, the more do
they indicate God’s care over men. For unless by the power of the Most High, the more
powerful would never minister to the inferior; and by this God is shown to have not only a
care over men, but some great affection, since He has deputed such noble elements to their
service. But that men may also attain to the friendship of God, is proved to us by the example
of those to whose prayers He has been so favourable, that He has withheld the heaven from
rain when they wished, and has again opened it when they prayed.768 And many other
things He has bestowed upon those who does His will, which could not be bestowed but
upon His friends. But you will say, What harm is done to God if these things also are worshipped
by us? If any one of you should pay to another the honour that is due to his father,
from whom he has received innumerable benefits, and should reverence a stranger and
foreigner as his father, should you not think that he was undutiful towards his father, and
most deserving to be disinherited?</p>

<p>“Others say, It is wicked if we do not worship those idols which have come down to us
from our fathers, and prove false to the religion bequeathed to us by our ancestors. On this
principle, if any one’s father was a robber or a base fellow, he ought not to change the
manner of life handed down to him by his fathers, nor to be recalled from his father’s errors
to a better way; and it is reckoned impious if one do not sin with his parents, or does not
persist in impiety with them. Others say, We ought not to be troublesome to God, and to
be always burdening Him with complaints of our miseries, or with the exigencies of our
petitions. How foolish and witless an answer! Do you think it is troublesome to God if you
thank Him for His benefits, while you do not think it troublesome to Him if, for His gifts,
you render thanks to stocks and stones? And how comes it, that when rain is withheld in
a long drought, we all turn our eyes to heaven, and entreat the gift of rain from God Almighty,
and all of us with our little ones pour out prayers on God and entreat His compassion? But
truly ungrateful souls, when they obtain the blessing, quickly forget: for as soon as they
have gathered in their harvest or their vintage, straightway they offer the first-fruits to deaf
and dumb images, and pay vows in temples or groves for those things which God has bestowed
upon them, and then offer sacrifices to demons; and having received a favour, deny
the bestower of the favour.769</p>

judgment, that from the very disgrace of your doings and your feelings you may understand
how unworthy it is to be subject to demons and not to God. Hence also, by the friendship
of demons, men are brought to disgraceful and base deeds; hence, men proceed even to the

<p>“But some one will say, These passions sometimes befall even those who worship God.
It is not true. For we say, that he is a worshipper of God, who does the will of God, and
observes the precepts of His law. For in God’s estimation he is not a Jew who is called a Jew
among men (nor is he a Gentile that is called a Gentile), but he who, believing in God, fulfils
His law and does His will, though he be not circumcised.771 He is the true worshipper of
God, who not only is himself free from passions, but also sets others free from them; though
they be so heavy that they are like mountains, he removes them by means of the faith with
which he believes in God. Yea, by faith he truly removes mountains with their trees, if it be
necessary.772 But he who seems to worship God, but is neither fortified by a full faith, nor
by obedience to the commandments, but is a sinner, has given a place in himself, by reason
of his sins, to passions, which are appointed of God for the punishment of those who sin,
that they may exact from them the deserts of their sins by means of punishments inflicted,
and may bring them purified to the general judgment of all, provided always that their faith
do not fail them in their chastisement. For the chastisement of unbelievers in the present
life is a judgment, by which they begin to be separated from future blessings; but the chastisement
of those who worship God, while it is inflicted upon them for sins into which they
have fallen, exacts from them the due of what they have done, that, preventing the judgment,
they may pay the debt of their sin in the present life, and be freed, at least in half, from the
eternal punishments which are there prepared.</p>

<p>“And, therefore, although the serpent lurking within you occupies your senses with a

turn you away from the hearing of saving instruction, all the more ought you to resist him,
and despising his suggestions, to come together the more frequently to hear the word and
receive instruction from us, because nobody can learn anything who is not taught.”773</p>
<p>And when he had done speaking, he ordered those to be brought to him who were oppressed
by sickness or demons, and laid his hands upon them with prayer; and so he dismissed
the crowds, charging them to resort to the hearing of the word during the days that
he was to remain there. Therefore, when the crowds had departed, Peter washed his body
in the waters which ran through the garden, with as many of the others as chose to do so;
and then ordered the couches to be spread on the ground under a very shady tree, and directed
us to recline according to the order established at Cæsarea. And thus, having taken
food and given thanks to God after the manner of the Hebrews, as there was yet some portion
of the day remaining, he ordered us to question him on any matters that we pleased. And
although we were with him twenty in all, he explained to every one whatever he pleased to
ask of him; the particulars of which I set down in books and sent to you some time ago.
And when evening came we entered with him into the lodging, and went to sleep, each one

<p>But as soon as day began to advance the dawn upon the retiring darkness, Peter having
gone into the garden to pray, and returning thence and coming to us, by way of excuse for
awaking and coming to us a little later than usual, said this:774 “Now that the spring-time
has lengthened the day, of course the night is shorter; if, therefore, one desires to occupy
some portion of the night in study, he must not keep the same hours775 for waking at all
seasons, but should spend the same length of time in sleeping, whether the night be longer
or shorter, and be exceedingly careful that he do not cut off from the period which he is
wont to have for study, and so add to his sleep and lessen his time of keeping awake. And
this also is to be observed, lest haply if sleep be interrupted while the food is still undigested,
the undigested mass lead the mind, and by the exhalation of crude spirits render the inner
sense confused and disturbed. It is right, therefore, that that part also be cherished with
sufficient rest, so that, those things being sufficiently accomplished which are due to it, the
body may be able in other things to render due service to the mind.”</p>

<p>When he had said this, as very many had already assembled in the accustomed place of
the garden to hear him, Peter went forth; and having saluted the crowds in his usual manner,
began to speak as follows:776 “Since, indeed, as land neglected by the cultivator necessarily
produces thorns and thistles, so your sense, by long neglect, has produced a plentiful crop
of noxious opinions of things and dogmas of false science; there is need now of much care
in cultivating the field of your mind, that the word of truth, which is the true and diligent
husbandman of the heart, may cultivate it with continual instructions. It is therefore your
part to render obedience to it, and to lop off superfluous occupations and anxieties, lest a
noxious growth choke the good seed of the word. For it may be that a short and earnest
diligence may repair a long time’s neglect; for the time of every one’s life is uncertain, and
therefore we must hasten to salvation, lest haply sudden death seize upon him who delays.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Righteous Anger.</head>
<p>“And all the more eagerly must we strive on this account, that while there is time, the
collected vices of evil custom may be cut off. And this you shall not be able to do otherwise,
than by being angry with yourselves on account of your profitless and base doings. For this
is righteous and necessary anger, by which every one is indignant with himself, and accuses
himself for those things in which he has erred and done amiss; and by this indignation a
certain fire is kindled in us, which, applied as it were to a barren field, consumes and burns
up the roots of vile pleasure, and renders the soil of the heart more fertile for the good seed
of the word of God. And I think that you have sufficiently worthy causes of anger, from
which that most righteous fire may be kindled, if you consider into what errors the evil of
ignorance has drawn you, and how it has caused you to fall and rush headlong into sin, from
what good things it has withdrawn you, and into what evils it has driven you, and, what is
of more importance than all the rest, how it has made you liable to eternal punishments in
the world to come. Is not the fire of most righteous indignation kindled within you for all
these things, now that the light of truth has shone upon you; and does not the flame of that
anger which is pleasing to God rise within you, that every sprout may be burnt up and destroyed
from the root, if haply any shoot of evil concupiscence has budded within you?</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Not Peace, But a Sword.</head>
<p>Hence, also, He who hath sent us, when He had come,777 and had seen that all the world
had fallen into wickedness, did not forthwith give peace to him who is in error, lest He
should confirm him in evil; but set the knowledge of truth in opposition to the ruins of ignorance
of it, that, if haply men would repent and look upon the light of truth, they might
rightly grieve that they had been deceived and drawn away into the precipices of error, and
might kindle the fire of salutary anger against the ignorance that had deceived them. On
this account, therefore, He said, ‘I have come to send fire on the earth; and how I wish that
it were kindled!’778 There is therefore a certain fight, which is to be fought by us in this life;
for the word of truth and knowledge necessarily separates men from error and ignorance,
as we have often seen putrified and dead flesh in the body separated by the cutting knife
from its connection with the living members. Such is the effect produced by knowledge of
the truth. For it is necessary that, for the sake of salvation, the son, for example, who has
received the word of truth, be separated from his unbelieving parents; or again, that the
father be separated from his son, or the daughter from her mother. And in this manner the
battle of knowledge and ignorance, of truth and error, arises between believing and unbelieving
kinsmen and relations. And therefore He who has sent us said again, ‘I am not come
to send peace on earth, but a sword.’779</p>

<p>“But if any one say, How does it seem right for men to be separated from their parents?
I will tell you how. Because, if they remained with them in error, they would do no good
to them, and they would themselves perish with them. It is therefore right, and very right,
that he who will be saved be separated from him who will not. But observe this also, that
this separation does not come from those who understand aright; for they wish to be with
their relatives, and to do them good, and to teach them better things. But it is the vice peculiar
to ignorance, that it will not bear to have near it the light of truth, which confutes it;
and therefore that separation originates with them. For those who receive the knowledge
of the truth, because it is full of goodness, desire, if it be possible, to share it with all, as given
by the good God; yea, even with those who hate and persecute them: for they know that
ignorance is the cause of their sin. Wherefore, in short, the Master Himself, when He was
being led to the cross by those who knew Him not, prayed the Father for His murderers,
and said, ‘Father, forgive their sin, for they know not what they do!’780 The disciples also,
in imitation of the Master, even when themselves were suffering, in like manner prayed for
their murderers.781 But if we are taught to pray even for our murderers and persecutors,
how ought we not to bear the persecutions of parents and relations, and to pray for their
conversion?</p>

<p>“Then let us consider carefully, in the next place, what reason we have for loving our
parents. For this cause, it is said, we love them, because they seem to be the authors of our
life. But our parents are not authors of our life, but means of it. For they do not bestow
life, but afford the means of our entering into this life; while the one and sole author of life
is God. If, therefore we would love the Author of our life, let us know that it is He that is
to be loved. But then it is said, We cannot know Him; but them we know, and hold in affection.
Be it so: you cannot know what God is, but you can very easily know what God is
not. For how can any man fail to know that wood, or stone, or brass, or other such matter,
is not God? But if you will not give your mind to consider the things which you might easily

from God. For thus saith the prophet Moses: ‘In the beginning God made the heaven and
the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unarranged; and darkness was over the deep:
and the Spirit of God was upon the waters.’782 Which Spirit, like the Creator’s hand, by
command of God separated light from darkness; and after that invisible heaven produced
this visible one, that He might make the higher places a habitation for angels, and the lower
for men. For your sake, therefore, by command of God, the water which was upon the face
of the earth withdrew, that the earth might produce fruits for you; and into the earth also
He inserted veins of moisture, that fountains and rivers might flow forth from it for you.
For your sake it was commanded to bring forth living creatures, and all things which could
serve for your use and pleasure. Is it not for you that the winds blow, that the earth, conceiving
by them, may bring forth fruits? Is it not for you that the showers fall, and the seasons
change? Is it not for you that the sun rises and sets, and the moon undergoes her changes?
For you the sea offers its service, that all things may be subject to you, ungrateful as you
are. For all these things shall there not be a righteous punishment of vengeance, because
beyond all else you are ignorant of the bestower of all these things, whom you ought to acknowledge

God is the head of the Only-begotten, by whom we come to the Father in such order as we
have stated above. But when you have come to the Father you will learn that this is His will,
that you be born anew by means of waters, which were first created.783 For he who is regenerated
by water, having filled up the measure of good works, is made heir of Him by whom
he has been regenerated in incorruption. Wherefore, with prepared minds, approach as
sons to a father, that your sins may be washed away, and it may be proved before God that
ignorance was their sole cause. For if, after the learning of these things, you remain in unbelief,
the cause of your destruction will be imputed to yourselves, and not to ignorance.
And do you suppose that you can have hope towards God, even if you cultivate all piety and
all righteousness, but do not receive baptism. Yea rather, he will be worthy of greater punishment,
who does good works not well; for merit accrues to men from good works, but
only if they be done as God commands. Now God has ordered every one who worships
Him to be sealed by baptism; but if you refuse, and obey your own will rather than God’s,

<p>“But you will perhaps say, What does the baptism of water contribute towards the
worship of God? In the first place, because that which hath pleased God is fulfilled. In the
second place, because, when you are regenerated and born again of water and of God, the
frailty of your former birth, which you have through men, is cut off, and so at length you
shall be able to attain salvation; but otherwise it is impossible. For thus hath the true
prophet testified to us with an oath: ‘Verily I say to you, That unless a man is born again
of water, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.’784 Therefore make haste; for there
is in these waters a certain power of mercy which was borne upon them at the beginning,
and acknowledges those who are baptized under the name of the threefold sacrament, and
rescues them from future punishments, presenting as a gift to God the souls that are consecrated
by baptism. Betake yourselves therefore to these waters, for they alone can quench
the violence of the future fire; and he who delays to approach to them, it is evident that the
idol of unbelief remains in him, and by it he is prevented from hastening to the waters which
confer salvation. For whether you be righteous or unrighteous, baptism is necessary for
you in every respect: for the righteous, that perfection may be accomplished in him, and
he may be born again to God; for the unrighteous, that pardon may be vouchsafed him of
the sins which he has committed in ignorance. Therefore all should hasten to be born again
to God without delay, because the end of every one’s life is uncertain.</p>

know nothing of murder or adultery, to flee from hatred and covetousness, to put away
anger, pride, and boasting, to abhor envy, and to count all such things entirely unsuitable

imposed upon men, as it is sought out by every worshipper of God by reason of its purity.
By reason of chastity, I say, of which there are many kinds, but first, that every one be careful
that he ‘come not near a menstruous woman;’ for this the law of God regards as detestable.
But though the law had given no admonition concerning these things, should we willingly,

<p>“Moreover, it is good, and tends to purity, also to wash the body with water. I call it
good, not as if it were that prime good of the purifying of the mind, but because this of the
washing of the body is the sequel of that good. For so also our Master rebuked some of the
Pharisees and scribes, who seemed to be better than others, and separated from the people,
calling them hypocrites, because they purified only those things which were seen of men,
but left defiled and sordid their hearts, which God alone sees. To some therefore of
them—not to all—He said, ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye cleanse
the outside of the cup and platter, but the inside is full of pollution. O blind Pharisees, first
make clean what is within, and what is without shall be clean also.’785 For truly, if the mind
be purified by the light of knowledge, when once it is clean and clear, then it necessarily
takes care of that which is without a man, that is, his flesh, that it also may be purified. But
when that which is without, the cleansing of the flesh, is neglected, it is certain that there is
no care taken of the purity of the mind and the cleanness of the heart. Thus therefore it
comes to pass, that he who is clean inwardly is without doubt cleansed outwardly also, but
not always that he who is clean outwardly is also cleansed inwardly—to wit, when he does
these things that he may please men.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Importance of Chastity.</head>
<p>“But this kind of chastity is also to be observed, that sexual intercourse must not take
place heedlessly and for the sake of mere pleasure, but for the sake of begetting children.786
And since this observance is found even amongst some of the lower animals, it were a shame
if it be not observed by men, reasonable, and worshipping God. But there is this further
reason why chastity should be observed by those who hold the true worship of God, in those
forms of it of which we have spoken, and others of like sort, that it is observed strictly even
amongst those who are still held by the devil in error, for even amongst them there is in
some degree the observance of chastity. What then? Will you not observe, now that you
are reformed, what you observed when you were in error?</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Superiority of Christian Morality.</head>
<p>“But perhaps some one of you will say, Must we then observe all things which we did
while we worshipped idols? Not all. But whatever things were done well, these you ought
to observe even now; because, if anything is rightly done by those who are in error, it is
certain that that is derived from the truth; whereas, if anything is not rightly done in the
true religion, that is, without doubt, borrowed from error. For good is good, though it be
done by those who are in error; and evil is evil, though it be done by those who follow the
truth. Or shall we be so foolish, that if we see a worshipper of idols to be sober, we shall
refuse to be sober, lest we should seem to do the same things which he does who worships
idols? It is not so. But let this be our study, that if those who err do not commit murder,
we should not even be angry; if they do not commit adultery, we should not even covet another’s
wife; if they love their neighbours, we should love even our enemies; if they lend to
those who have the means of paying, we should give to those from whom we do not hope
to receive anything. And in all things, we who hope for the inheritance of the eternal world
ought to excel those who know only the present world; knowing that if their works, when
compared with our works, be found like and equal in the day of judgment, there will be
confusion to us, because we are found equal in our works to those who are condemned on
account of ignorance, and had no hope of the world to come.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Knowledge Enhances Responsibility.</head>
<p>“And truly confusion is our worthy portion, if we have done no more than those who
are inferior to us in knowledge. But if it be confusion to us, to be found equal to them in
works, what shall become of us if the examination that is to take place find us inferior and
worse than them? Hear, therefore, how our true Prophet has taught us concerning these
things; for, with respect to those who neglect to hear the words of wisdom, He speaks thus:
‘The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it,
because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold,
a greater than Solomon is here, and they hear Him not.’787 But with respect to those who
refused to repent of their evil deeds, He spoke thus: ‘The men of Nineve shall rise in the
judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of
Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.’788 You see, therefore, how He condemned
those who were instructed out of the law, by adducing the example of those who came from
Gentile ignorance, and showing that the former were not even equal to those who seemed
to live in error. From all these things, then, the statement that He propounded is proved,
that chastity, which is observed to a certain extent even by those who live in error, should
be held much more purely and strictly, in all its forms, as we showed above, by us who follow
the truth; and the rather because with us eternal rewards are assigned to its observance.”</p>

<p>When he had said these things, and others to the same effect, he dismissed the crowds;
and having, according to his custom, supped with his friends, he went to sleep. And while
in this manner he was teaching the word of God for three whole months, and converting
multitudes to the faith, at the last he ordered me to fast; and after the fast he conferred on
me the baptism of ever-flowing water, in the fountains which adjoin the sea.789 And when,
for the grace of regeneration divinely conferred upon me, we had joyfully kept holiday with
our brethren, Peter ordered those who had been appointed to go before him, to proceed to
Antioch, and there to wait three months more. And they having gone, he himself led down
to the fountains, which, I have said, are near the sea, those who had fully received the faith
of the Lord, and baptized them; and celebrating790 the Eucharist with them, he appointed,
as bishop over them, Maro, who had entertained him in his house, and who was now perfect
in all things; and with him he ordained twelve presbyters and deacons at the same time. He
also instituted the order of widows, and arranged all the services of the Church; and charged
them all to obey Maro their bishop in all things that he should command them. And thus
all things being suitably arranged, when the three months were fulfilled, we bade farewell
to those who were at Tripolis, and set out for Antioch.</p>

<p>At length leaving Tripolis,791 a city of Phoenicia, we made our first halt at Ortosias, not

had believed in the Lord, unable to part from Peter, followed him thus far. Thence we came
to Antharadus. But because there were many in our company, Peter said to Niceta and
Aquila: “As there are immense crowds of brethren with as, and we bring upon ourselves
no little envy as we enter into every city, it seems to me that we must take means, without
doing so unpleasing a thing as to prevent their following us, to secure that the wicked one
shall not stir up envy against us on account of any display! I wish, therefore, that you, Niceta

greater. But if, by reason of our mutual affection, we will not do the things that are right
and honourable, such love will appear to be unreasonable. And therefore, without bating
a little of our love, let us attend to those things which seem useful and necessary; especially
since not a day can pass in which you may not be present at my discussions. For I purpose
to pass through the most noted cities of the provinces one by one, as you also know, and to
reside three months in each for the sake of teaching. Now, therefore, go before me to
Laodicea, which is the nearest city, and I shall follow you after two or three days, so far as I
purpose. But you shall wait for me at the inn nearest to the gate of the city; and thence again,
when we have spent a few days there, you shall go before me to more distant cities. And
this I wish you to do at every city, for the sake of avoiding envy as much as in us lies, and

to do and to counsel well in all things; but also because, while it is a heavy loss not to see
our lord Peter for one, or it may be two days, yet it is not intolerable. And we think of our
twelve brethren who go before us, and who are deprived of the advantage of hearing and
seeing you for a whole month out of the three that you stay in every city. Therefore we shall
not delay doing as you order, because you order all things aright.” And thus saying, they

you die if you were separated from me for a good purpose? Would you not put a restraint

the object of all my affections, instead of father and mother, and brethren; but above all this,
is the fact that you alone are the cause of my salvation and knowledge of the truth. And
also this I do not count of least moment, that my youthful age is subject to the snares of
lusts; and I am afraid to be without you, by whose sole presence all effeminacy, however ir-
rational it be, is put to shame; although I trust, by the mercy of God, that even my mind,
from what it has conceived through your instruction, shall be unable to receive aught else
into its thoughts. Besides, I remember your saying at Cæsarea, ‘If any one wishes to accompany
me, without violating dutifulness, let him accompany me.’ And by this you meant
that he should not make any one sad, to whom he ought according to God’s appointment
to cleave; for example, that he should not leave a faithful wife, or parents, or the like. Now
from these I am entirely free, and so I am fit for following you; and I wish you would grant

<p>Then Peter, laughing, said: “And do you not think, Clement, that very necessity must
make you my servant? For who else can spread my sheets, and arrange my beautiful coverlets?
Who will be at hand to keep my rings, and prepare my robes, which I must be constantly
changing? Who shall superintend my cooks, and provide various and choice meats to be
prepared by most recondite and various art; and all those things which are procured at
enormous expense, and are brought together for men of delicate up-bringing, yea rather,
for their appetite, as for some enormous beast? But perhaps, although you live with me,
you do not know my manner of life. I live on bread alone, with olives, and seldom even
with pot-herbs; and my dress is what you see, a tunic with a pallium: and having these, I
require nothing more. This is sufficient for me, because my mind does not regard things
present, but things eternal, and therefore no present and visible thing delights me. Whence
I embrace and admire indeed your good mind towards me; and I commend you the more,
because, though you have been accustomed to so great abundance, you have been able so
soon to abandon it, and to accommodate yourself to this life of ours, which makes use of
necessary things alone. For we—that is, I and my brother Andrew—have grown up from
our childhood not only orphans, but also extremely poor, and through necessity have become
used to labour, whence now also we easily bear the fatigues of our journeyings. But rather,
if you would consent and allow it, I, who am a working man, could more easily discharge
the duty of a servant to you.”</p>

have I so sinned against you, that you should distress me with such a proposal?” Then Peter:
“If it is evil that I said I should serve you, you were first in fault in saying the same thing to
me.” Then said I: “The cases are not alike: for it becomes me to do this to you; but it is
grievous that you, who are sent as the herald of the Most High God to save the souls of men,
should say it to me.” Then said Peter: “I should agree with you, were it not that our Lord,
who came for the salvation of the whole world, and who was nobler than any creature,
submitted to be a servant, that He might persuade us not to be ashamed to perform the
ministry of servants to our brethren.” Then said I: “It were foolishness in me to suppose

to my father, as being his relative, and educated along with him, and of a suitably noble
family. By her my father had twin sons, born before me, not very like one another, as my
father told me; for I never knew them. But indeed I have not a distinct recollection even of
my mother; but I cherish the remembrance of her face, as if I had seen it in a dream. My
mother’s name was Matthidia, my father’s Faustinianus: my brothers’, Faustinus and
Faustus.792 Now, when I was barely five years old, my mother saw a vision—so I learned
from my father—by which she was warned that, unless she speedily left the city with her
twin sons, and was absent for ten years, she and her children should perish by a miserable
fate.</p>

that the vision had not commanded me also to go with my mother. And at the end of a year

being cast ashore anywhere, four years ago; when one told one story and another another,
but nothing definite was disclosed to us searching in this boundless sea. Yet my father, by
reason of the great affection which he bore to his wife and children, was fed with vain hopes,
until he thought of placing me under guardians and leaving me at Rome, as I was now twelve
years old, and himself going in quest of them. Therefore he went down to the harbour
weeping, and going on board a ship, took his departure; and from that time till now I have
never received any letters from him, nor do I know whether he is alive or dead. But I rather

gnawing them. Being born of noble parents, and having become the wife of a suitably
powerful man, I had two twin sons, and after them one other. But my husband’s brother
was vehemently enflamed with unlawful love towards me; and as I valued chastity above all
things, and would neither consent to so great wickedness, nor wished to disclose to my
husband the baseness of his brother, I considered whether in any way I could escape unpolluted,
and yet not set brother against brother, and so bring the whole race of a noble family

did not do so, I should perish with all my children. And so it was done. For as soon as I
told the dream to my husband, he was terrified; and sending with me my twin sons, and
also slaves and maid-servants, and giving me plenty of money, he ordered me to sail to
Athens, where I might educate my sons, and that I should stay there until he who commanded
me to depart should give me leave to return. While I was sailing along with my sons, I was

<head>Chapter XXI.—A Discovery.</head>
<p>When Peter had thus spoken, the woman, struck with astonishment, fainted. Then
Peter began to hold her up, and to comfort her, and to ask what was the matter, or what she
suffered. But she at length, with difficulty recovering her breath, and nerving herself up to
the greatness of the joy which she hoped for, and at the same time wiping her face, said: “Is
he here, the youth of whom you speak?” But Peter, when he understood the matter, said:
“Tell me first, or else you shall not see him.” Then she said: “I am the mother of the youth.”
Then says Peter: “What is his name?” And she answered: “Clement.” Then said Peter: “It
is himself; and he it was that spoke with me a little while ago, and whom I ordered to go
before me to the ship.” Then she fell down at Peter’s feet and began to entreat him that he
would hasten to the ship. Then Peter said: “Yes, if you will promise me that you will do as
I say.” Then she said: “I will do anything; only show me my only son, for I think that in
him I shall see my twins also.” Then Peter said: “When you have seen him, dissemble for
a little time, until we leave the island.” “I will do so,” she said.</p>

<p>Then Peter, holding her hand, led her to the ship. And when I saw him giving his hand
to the woman, I began to laugh; yet, approaching to do him honour, I tried to substitute my
hand for his, and to support the woman. But as soon as I touched her hand, she uttered a
loud scream, and rushed into my embrace, and began to devour me with a mother’s kisses.
But I, being ignorant of the whole matter, pushed her off as a mad woman; and at the same
time, though with reverence, I was somewhat angry with Peter.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—A Miracle.</head>
<p>But he said: “Cease: what mean you, O Clement, my son? Do not push away your
mother.” But I, as soon as I heard these words, immediately bathed in tears, fell upon my
mother, who had fallen down, and began to kiss her. For as soon as I heard, by degrees I
recalled her countenance to my memory; and the longer I gazed, the more familiar it grew
to me. Mean time a great multitude assembled, hearing that the woman who used to sit
and beg was recognised by her son, who was a good man.794 And when we wished to sail
hastily away from the island, my mother said to me: “My darling son, it is right that I should
bid farewell to the woman who took me in; for she is poor, and paralytic, and bedridden.”
When Peter and all who were present heard this, they admired the goodness and prudence
of the woman; and immediately Peter ordered some to go and to bring the woman in her
bed as she lay. And when she had been brought, and placed in the midst of the crowd, Peter
said, in the presence of all: “If I am a preacher of truth, for confirming the faith of all those
who stand by, that they may know and believe that there is one God, who made heaven and
earth, in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, let this woman rise.” And as soon as he had said
this, she arose whole, and fell down at Peter’s feet; and greeting her friend and acquaintance
with kisses asked of her was the meaning of it all. But she shortly related to her the whole
proceeding of the Recognition,795 so that the crowds standing around wondered.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV—Departure from Aradus.</head>
<p>Then Peter, so far as he could, and as time permitted, addressed the crowds on the faith
of God, and the ordinances of religion; and then added, that if any one wished to know more
accurately about these things, he should come to Antioch, “where,” said he, “we have resolved
to stay three months, and to teach fully the things which pertain to salvation. For if,” said
he, “men leave their country and their parents for commercial or military purposes, and do
not fear to undertake long voyages, why should it be thought burdensome or difficult to
leave home for three months for the sake of eternal life?” When he had said these things,
and more to the same purpose, I presented a thousand drachmas to the woman who had
entertained my mother, and who had recovered her health by means of Peter, and in the
presence of all committed her to the charge of a certain good man, the chief person in that
town, who promised that he would gladly do what we demanded of him. I also distributed
a little money among some others, and among those women who were said formerly to have
comforted my mother in her miseries, to whom I also expressed my thanks. And after this
we sailed, along with my mother, to Antaradus.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Journeyings.</head>
<p>And when we had come to our lodging,796 my mother began to ask of me what had
become of my father; and I told her that he had gone to seek her, and never returned. But
she, hearing this, only sighed; for her great joy on my account lightened her other sorrows.
And the next day she journeyed with us, sitting with Peter’s wife; and we came to Balaneæ,
where we stayed three days, and then went on to Pathos, and afterwards to Gabala; and so
we arrived at Laodicea, where Niceta and Aquila met us before the gates, and kissing us,
conducted us to a lodging. But Peter, seeing that it was a large and splendid city, said that
it was worthy that we should stay in it ten days, or even longer. Then Niceta and Aquila
asked of me who was this unknown woman; and I answered: “It is my mother, whom God
has given back to me by means of my lord Peter.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Recapitulation.</head>
<p>And when I had said this, Peter began to relate the whole matter to them in order,797
and said, “When we had come to Aradus,798 and I had ordered you to go on before us, the
same day after you had gone, Clement was led in the course of conversation to tell me of
his extraction and his family, and how he had been deprived of his parents, and had had
twin brothers older than himself, and that, as his father told him, his mother once saw a
vision, by which she was ordered to depart from the city of Rome with her twin sons, else
she and they should suddenly perish. And when she had told his father the dream, he, loving
his sons with tender affection, and afraid of any evil befalling them, put his wife and sons
on board a ship with all necessaries, and sent them to Athens to be educated. Afterwards
he sent once and again persons to inquire after them, but nowhere found even a trace of
them. At last the father himself went on the search, and until now he is nowhere to be found.
When Clement had given me this narrative, there came one to us, asking us to go to the
neighbouring island of Aradus, to see vine-wood columns of wonderful size. I consented;
and when we came to the place, all the rest went into the interior of the temple; but I—for
what reason I know not—had no mind to go farther.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Recapitulation Continued.</head>
<p>“But while I was waiting outside for them, I began to notice this woman, and to wonder
in what part of her body she was disabled, that she did not seek her living by the labour of
her hands, but submitted to the shame of beggary. I therefore asked of her the reason of it.
She confessed that she was sprung of a noble race, and was married to a no less noble husband,
‘whose brother,’ said she, ‘being inflamed by unlawful love towards me, desired to
defile his brother’s bed. This I abhorring, and yet not daring to tell my husband of so great
wickedness, lest I should stir up war between the brothers, and bring disgrace upon the
family, judged it better to depart from my country with my two twin sons, leaving the
younger boy to be a comfort to his father. And that this might be done with an honourable
appearance, I thought good to feign a dream, and to tell my husband that there stood by
me in a vision a certain deity, who told me to set out from the city immediately with my
two twins, and remain until he should instruct me to return.’ She told me that her husband,
when he heard this, believed her, and sent her to Athens, with the twin children to be educated
there; but that they were driven by a terrible tempest upon that island, where, when
the ship had gone to pieces, she was lifted by a wave upon a rock, and delayed killing herself
only for this, ‘until,’ said she, ‘I could embrace at least the dead limbs of my unfortunate
sons, and commit them to burial. But when the day dawned, and crowds had assembled,
they took pity upon me, and threw a garment over me. But I, miserable, entreated them
with many tears, to search if they could find anywhere the bodies of my unfortunate sons.
And I, tearing all my body with my teeth, with wailing and howlings cried out constantly,
Unhappy woman that I am, where is my Faustus? where my Faustinus?’”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—More Recognitions.</head>
<p>And when Peter said this,799 Niceta and Aquila suddenly started up, and being astonished,
began to be greatly agitated, saying: “O Lord, Thou Ruler and God of all, are these
things true, or are we in a dream?” Then Peter said: “Unless we be mad, these things are
true.” But they, after a short pause, and wiping their faces, said: “We are Faustinus and
Faustus: and even at the first, when you began this narrative, we immediately fell into a
suspicion that the matters that you spoke of might perhaps relate to us; yet again considering
that many like things happen in men’s lives, we kept silence, although our hearts were struck
by some hope. Therefore we waited for the end of your story, that, if it were entirely manifest
that it related to us, we might then confess it.” And when they had thus spoken, they went
in weeping to our mother. And when they found her asleep, and wished to embrace her,
Peter prevented them, saying: “Permit me first to prepare your mother’s mind, lest haply
by the great and sudden joy she lose her reason, and her understanding be disturbed, especially
as she is now stupefied with sleep.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—“Nothing Common or Unclean.”</head>
<p>Therefore, when our mother had risen from her sleep, Peter began to address her, saying:
“I wish you to know, O woman, an observance of our religion. We worship one God, who
made the world, and we keep His law, in which He commands us first of all to worship Him,
and to reverence His name, to honour our parents, and to preserve chastity and uprightness.
But this also we observe, not to have a common table with Gentiles, unless when they believe,
and on the reception of the truth are baptized, and consecrated by a certain threefold invocation
of the blessed name; and then we eat with them.800 Otherwise, even if it were a father
or a mother, or wife, or sons, or brothers, we cannot have a common table with them. Since,
therefore, we do this for the special cause of religion, let it not seem hard to you that your
son cannot eat with you, until you have the same judgment of the faith that he has.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—“Who Can Forbid Water?”</head>
<p>Then she, when she heard this, said: “And what hinders me to be baptized to-day? For
even before I saw you I was wholly alienated from those whom they call gods because they
were not able to do anything for me, although I frequently, and almost daily, sacrificed to
them. And as to chastity, what shall I say, when neither in former times did pleasures deceive
me, nor afterwards did poverty compel me to sin? But I think you know well enough how
great was my love of chastity, when I pretended that dream that I might escape the snares
of unhallowed love, and that I might go abroad with my two twins, and when I left this my
son Clement alone to be a comfort to his father. For if two were scarcely enough for me,
how much more it would have saddened their father, if he had had none at all? For he was
wretched through his great affection towards our sons, so that even the authority of the
dream could scarce prevail upon him to give up to me Faustinus and Faustus, the brothers
of this Clement, and that himself should be content with Clement alone.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Too Much Joy.</head>
<p>While she was yet speaking, my brothers could contain themselves no longer, but rushed
into their mother’s embrace with many tears, and kissed her. But she said: “What is the
meaning of this?” “Then said Peter: “Be not disturbed, O woman; be firm. These are your
sons Faustinus and Faustus, whom you supposed to have perished in the deep; but how they
are alive, and how they escaped in that horrible night, and how the one of them is called
Niceta and the other Aquila, they will be able to explain to you themselves, and we also shall
hear it along with you.” When Peter had said this, our mother fainted, being overcome with
excess of joy; and after some time, being restored and come to herself, she said: “I beseech
you, darling sons, tell me what has befallen you since that dismal and cruel night.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—“He Bringeth Them Unto Their Desired Haven.”</head>
<p>Then Niceta began to say: “On that night, O mother, when the ship was broken up,
and we were being tossed upon the sea, supported on a fragment of the wreck, certain men,
whose business it was to rob by sea, found us, and placed us in their boat, and overcoming
the power of the waves by rowing, by various stretches brought us to Cæsarea Stratonis.
There they starved us, and beat us, and terrified us, that we might not disclose the truth;
and having changed our names, they sold us to a certain widow, a very honourable women,
named Justa. She, having bought us, treated us as sons, so that she carefully educated us in
Greek literature and liberal arts. And when we grew up, we also attended to philosophic
studies, that we might be able to confute the Gentiles, by supporting the doctrines of the
divine religion by philosophic disputations.</p>

<pb n="473"/>
<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Another Wreck Prevented.</head>
<p>“But we adhered, for friendship’s sake and boyish companionship, to one Simon, a
magician, who was educated along with us, so that we were almost deceived by him. For
there is mention made in our religion of a certain Prophet, whose coming was hoped for
by all who observe that religion, through whom immortal and happy life is promised to be
given to those who believe in Him. Now we thought that this Simon was he. But these
things shall be explained to you, O mother, at a more convenient season. Meanwhile, when
we were almost deceived by Simon, a certain colleague of my lord Peter, Zacchæus by name,
warned us that we should not be duped by the magician, but presented us to Peter on his
arrival, that by him we might be taught the things which were sound and perfect. And this
we hope will happen to you also, even as God has vouchsafed it to us, that we may be able
to eat and have a common table with you. Thus therefore it was, O mother, that you believed
that we were drowned in the sea, while we were stolen by pirates.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
<pb n="474"/>
<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Baptism Must Be Preceded by Fasting.</head>
<p>When Niceta had spoken thus, our mother fell down at Peter’s feet, entreating and beseeching
him that both herself and her hostess might be baptized without delay; “that,” said
she, “I may not even for a single day suffer the loss of the company and society of my sons.”
In like manner, we her sons also entreated Peter. But he said: “What! Do you think that I
alone am unpitiful, and that I do not wish you to enjoy your mother’s society at meals? But
she must fast at least one day first, and so be baptized; and this because I have heard from
her a certain declaration, by which her faith has been made manifest to me, and which has
given evidence of her belief; otherwise she must have been instructed and taught many days
before she could have been baptized.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
<pb n="475"/>
<head>Chapter XXXV.—Desiring the Salvation of Others.</head>
<p>Then said I: “I pray you, my lord Peter, tell us what is that declaration which you say
afforded you evidence of her faith?” Then Peter: “It is her asking that her hostess, whose
kindnesses she wishes to requite, may be baptized along with her. Now she would not ask
that this grace be bestowed upon her whom she loves, unless she believed that there is some
great boon in baptism. Whence, also, I find fault with very many, who, when they are
themselves baptized and believe, yet do nothing worthy of faith with those whom they love,
such as wives, or children, or friends, whom they do not exhort to that which they themselves
have attained, as they would do if indeed they believed that eternal life is thereby bestowed.
In short, if they see them to be sick, or to be subject to any danger bodily, they grieve and
mourn, because they are sure that in this destruction threatens them. So, then, if they were
sure of this, that the punishment of eternal fire awaits those who do not worship God, when
would they cease warning and exhorting? Or, if they refused, how would they not mourn
and bewail them, being sure that eternal torments awaited them? Now, therefore, we shall
send for that woman at once, and see if she loves the faith of our religion; and as we find,
so shall we act. But since your mother has judged so faithfully concerning baptism, let her
fast only one day before baptism.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—The Sons’ Pleading.</head>
<p>But she declared with an oath, in presence of my lord Peter’s wife, that from the time
she recognised her son, she had been unable to take any food from excess of joy, excepting
only that yesterday she drank a cup of water. Peter’s wife also bore witness, saying that it
was even so. Then Aquila said: “What, then, hinders her being baptized?” Then Peter,
smiling, said: “But this is not the fast of baptism, for it was not done in order to baptism.”
Then Niceta said: “But perhaps God, wishing that our mother, on our recognition, should
not be separated even for one day from participation of our table, pre-ordained this fasting.
For as in her ignorance she preserved her chastity, that it might profit her in order to the
grace of baptism; so she fasted before she knew the reason of fasting, that it might profit her
in order to baptism, and that immediately, from the beginning of our acquaintance, she
might enjoy communion of the table with us.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—Peter Inexorable.</head>
<p>Then said Peter:801 “Let not the wicked one prevail against us, taking occasion from a
mother’s love; but let you, and me with you, fast this day along with her, and to-morrow
she shall be baptized: for it is not right that the precepts of truth be relaxed and weakened
in favour of any person or friendship. Let us not shrink, then, from suffering along with
her, for it is a sin to transgress any commandment. But let us teach our bodily senses, which
are without us, to be in subjection to our inner senses; and not compel our inner senses,
which savour the things that be of God, to follow the outer senses, which savour the things
that be of the flesh. For to this end also the Lord commanded, saying: ‘Whosoever shall
look upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.’
And to this He added: ‘If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for
it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, rather than thy whole body be cast
into hell-fire.’802 He does not say, has offended thee, that you should then cast away the
cause of sin after you have sinned; but if it offend you, that is, that before you sin you should
cut off the cause of the sin that provokes and irritates you. But let none of you think,
brethren, that the Lord commended the cutting off of the members. His meaning is, that
the purpose should be cut off, not the members, and the causes which allure to sin, in order
that our thought, borne up on the chariot of sight, may push towards the love of God, supported
by the bodily senses;803 and not give loose reins to the eyes of the flesh as to wanton
horses, eager to turn their running outside the way of the commandments, but may subject
the bodily sight to the judgment of the mind, and not suffer those eyes of ours, which God
intended to be viewers and witnesses of His work, to become panders of evil desire. And
therefore let the bodily senses as well as the internal thought be subject to the law of God,
and let them serve His will, whose work they acknowledge themselves to be.”</p>
<note type="footnote">801 [In Homily XIII. 12 the Apostle is represented as thus deferring the baptism; but a longer discourse on

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—Reward of Chastity.</head>
<p>Therefore, as the order and reason of the mystery demanded, on the following day she
was baptized in the sea,804 and returning to the lodging, was initiated in all the mysteries
of religion in their order. And we her sons, Niceta and Aquila, and I Clement, were present.
And after this we dined with her, and glorified God with her, thankfully acknowledging the
zeal and teaching of Peter, who showed us, by the example of our mother, that the good of
chastity is not lost with God;805 “as, on the other hand,” said he, “unchastity does not escape
punishment, though it may not be punished immediately, but slowly. But so well pleasing,”
said he, “is chastity to God, that it confers some grace in the present life even upon those
who are in error; for future blessedness is laid up for those only who preserve chastity and
righteousness by the grace of baptism. In short, that which has befallen your mother is an
example of this, for all this welfare has been restored to her in reward of her chastity, for
the guarding and preserving of which continence alone is not sufficient; but when any one
perceives that snares and deceptions are being prepared, he must straightway flee as from
the violence of fire or the attack of a mad dog, and not trust that he can easily frustrate snares
of this kind by philosophizing or by humouring them; but, as I have said, he must flee and
withdraw to a distance, as your mother also did through her true and entire love of chastity.
And on this account she has been preserved to you, and you to her; and in addition, she has
been endowed with the knowledge of eternal life.” When he had said this, and much more
to the same effect, the evening having come, we went to sleep.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The Old Workman.</head>
<p>Now the next morning Peter took my brothers and me with him, and we went down to
the harbour to bathe in the sea, and thereafter we retired to a certain secret place for prayer.
But a certain poor old man, a workman, as he appeared by his dress, began to observe us
eagerly, without our seeing him, that he might see what we were doing in secret.806 And
when he saw us praying, he waited till we came out, and then saluted us, and said: “If you
do not take it amiss, and regard me as an inquisitive and importunate person, I should wish
to converse with you; for I take pity on you, and would not have you err under the appearance
of truth, and be afraid of things that have no existence; or if you think that there is any truth
in them, then declare it to me. If, therefore, you take it patiently, I can in a few words instruct
you in what is right; but if it be unpleasant to you, I shall go on, and do my business.” To
him Peter answered: “Speak what you think good, and we will gladly hear, whether it be
true or false; for you are to be welcomed, because, like a father anxious on behalf of his
children, you wish to put us in possession of what you regard as good.”</p>
<note type="footnote">806 [From this point there are considerable variations in the two narratives. The old man becomes, in the
Recognitions, a prominent participant in the discussions, arguing with Peter, and with Niceta, Aquila, and
Clement. At the close of these discussions he is recognised first by the sons (ix. 35), and then by his wife, as
Faustinianus (ix. 37). In the Homilies Peter tells of an interview with the old man (xiv. 2–8), and the recognition
takes place immediately upon his appearance (xiv. 9). Some discussion with him follows (Homily XV.); but
soon the main controversy is with Simon Magus (Homilies XVI.–XIX.), in the presence of the father, who is

<p>Then the old man proceeded to say: “I saw you bathe in the sea, and afterwards retire
into a secret place; wherefore observing, without your noticing me, what you were doing, I
saw you praying. Therefore, pitying your error, I waited till you came out, that I might
speak to you, and instruct you not to err in an observance of this sort; because there is neither
any God, nor any worship, neither is there any providence in the world, but all things are
done by fortuitous chance and genesis, as I have discovered most clearly for myself, being
accomplished beyond others in the discipline of learning.807 Do not err, therefore: for
whether you pray, or whether you do not pray, whatever your genesis contains, that shall
befall you.” Then I Clement was affected, I know not how, in my heart, recollecting many
things in him that seemed familiar to me; for some one says well, that that which is sprung
from any one, although it may be long absent, yet a spark of relationship is never extinguished.
808 Therefore I began to ask of him who and whence he was, and how descended.
But he, not wishing to answer these questions, said: “What has that to do with what I have
told you? But first, if you please, let us converse of those matters which we have propounded;
and afterwards, if circumstances require, we can disclose to one another, as friends to friends,
our names, and families, and country, and other things connected with these.” Yet we all

speech.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—A Friendly Conference.</head>
<p>But Peter, walking along leisurely while conversing, was looking out for a suitable place
for a conference. And when he saw a quiet recess near the harbour, he made us sit down;
and so he himself first began. Nor did he hold the old man in any contempt, nor did he
look down upon him because his dress was poor and mean. He said, therefore: “Since you
seem to me to be a learned man, and a compassionate, inasmuch as you have come to us,
and wish that to be known to us which you consider to be good, we also wish to expound
to you what things we believe to be good and right; and if you do not think them true, you
will take in good part our good intentions towards you, as we do yours towards us.” While
Peter was thus speaking, a great multitude assembled. Then said the old man: “Perhaps
the presence of a multitude disconcerts you.” Peter replied: “Not at all, except only on this
account, that I am afraid lest haply, when the truth is made manifest in the course of our
discussion, you be ashamed in presence of the multitude to yield and assent to the things
which you may have understood to be spoken truly.” To this the old man answered: “I am
not such a fool in my old age, that, understanding what is true, I should deny it for the favour
of the rabble.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Question Stated.</head>
<p>Then Peter began to say: “Those who speak the word of truth, and who enlighten the
souls of men, seem to me to be like the rays of the sun, which, when once they have come
forth and appeared to the world, can no longer be concealed or hidden, while they are not
so much seen by men, as they afford sight to all. Therefore it was well said by One to the
heralds of the truth, ‘Ye are the light of the world, and a city set upon a hill cannot be hid;
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may
enlighten all who are in the house.’809” Then said the old man: “He said well, whoever he
is. But let one of you state what, according to his opinion, ought to be followed, that we
may direct our speech to a definite aim. For, in order to find the truth, it is not sufficient
to overthrow the things that are spoken on the other side, but also that one should himself
bring forward what he who is on the other side may oppose. Therefore, in order that both
parties may be on an equal footing, it seems to me to be right that each of us should first
enunciate what opinion he holds. And, if you please, I shall begin first. I say, then, that the
world is not governed according to the providence of God, because we see that many things
in it are done unjustly and disorderly; but I say that it is genesis that does and regulates all
things.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Freedom of Discussion Allowed.</head>
<p>When Peter was about to reply to this, Niceta, anticipating him, said:810 “Would my
lord Peter allow me to answer to this; and let it not be thought forward that I, a young man,
should have an encounter with an old man, but rather let me converse as a son with a father.”
Then said the old man: “Not only do I wish, my son, that you should set forth your opinions;
but also if any one of your associates, if any one even of the bystanders, thinks that he knows
anything, let him unhesitatingly state it: we shall gladly hear it; for it is by the contribution
of many that the things that are unknown are more easily found out.” Then Niceta therefore
answered: “Do not deem me to have done rashly, my father, because I have interrupted the
speech of my lord Peter; but rather I meant to honour him by doing this. For he is a man
of God, full of all knowledge, who is not ignorant even of Greek learning, because he is filled
with the Spirit of God, to whom nothing is unknown. But because it is suitable to him to
speak of heavenly things, I shall answer concerning those things which pertain to the babbling
of the Greeks. But after we have disputed in the Grecian manner, and we have come to that
point where no issue appears, then he himself, as filled with the knowledge of God, shall
openly and clearly disclose to us the truth on all matters, so that not we only, but also all
who are around us as hearers, shall learn the way of truth. And therefore now let him sit as
umpire; and when either of us shall yield, then let him, taking up the matter, give an unquestionable
judgment.”</p>
<note type="footnote">810 [The whole arrangement, introducing the brothers as disputants, is peculiar to the Recognitions. The

<head>Chapter VI.—The Other Side of the Question Stated.</head>
<p>When Niceta had thus spoken, those who had assembled conversed among themselves:
“Is this that Peter of whom we heard, the most approved disciple of Him who appeared in
Judæa, and wrought many signs and miracles?” And they stood gazing upon him with great
fear and veneration, as conferring upon the Lord the honour of His good servant. Which
when Peter observed, he said to them: “Let us hear with all attention, holding an impartial
judgment of what shall be said by each; and after their encounter we also shall add what
may seem necessary.” And when Peter had said this, the crowds rejoiced. Then Niceta
began to speak as follows: “You have laid down, my father, that the world is not governed
by the providence of God, but that all things are subject to genesis, whether the things which
relate to the dispositions, or those which relate to the doings of every one. This I could answer
immediately; but because it is right to observe order, we also lay down what we hold, as you
yourself requested should be done. I say that the world is governed by the providence of
God, at least in those things which need His government. For He it is alone who holds all
things in His hand, who also made the world; the just God, who shall at some time render
to every one according to his deeds. Now, then, you have our position; go on as you please,
either overthrowing mine or establishing your own, that I may meet your statements. Or
if you wish me to speak first, I shall not hesitate.”</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Way Cleared.</head>
<p>Then the old man answered: “Whether it pleases you, my son, to speak first, or
whether you prefer that I should speak, makes no difference, especially with those who discuss
in a friendly spirit. However, speak you first, and I will gladly hear; and I wish you may be
able even to follow out those things that are to be spoken by me, and to put in opposition
to them those things that are contrary to them, and from the comparison of both to show
the truth.” Niceta answered: “If you wish it, I can even state your side of the argument, and
then answer it.” Then the old man: “Show me first how you can know what I have not yet
spoken, and so I shall believe that you can follow out my side of the argument.” Then Niceta:
“Your sect is manifest, even by the proposition which you have laid down, to those who are
skilled in doctrines of this sort; and its consequence is certain. And because I am not ignorant
what are the propositions of the philosophers, I know what follows from those things which
you have propounded; especially because I have frequented the schools of Epicurus in
preference to the other philosophers. But my brother Aquila has attended more to the
Pyrrhonists, and our other brother to the Platonists and Aristotelians; therefore you have
to do with learned hearers.”811 Then said the old man: “You have well and logically informed
us how you perceived the things that follow from the statements which have been enunciated.
But I professed something more than the tenet of Epicurus; for I introduced the genesis, and
asserted that it is the cause of all the doings of men.”</p>

<head>Chapter VIII—Instincts.</head>
<p>When the old man had said this, I Clement said to him: “Hear, my father: if my
brother Niceta bring you to acknowledge that the world is not governed without the
providence of God, I shall be able to answer you in that part which remains concerning the
genesis; for I am well acquainted with this doctrine.” And when I had thus spoken, my
brother Aquila said: “What is the use of our calling him father, when we are commanded
to call no man father upon earth?”812 Then, looking to the old man, he said, “Do not take
it amiss, my father, that I have found fault with my brother for calling you father, for we
have a precept not to call any one by that name.” When Aquila said that, all the assembly
of the bystanders, as well as the old man and Peter, laughed. And when Aquila asked the
reason of their all laughing, I said to him: “Because you yourself do the very thing which
you find fault with in another; for you called the old man father.” But he denied it, saying:
“I am not aware that I called him father.” Meantime Peter was moved with certain suspicions,
813 as he told us afterwards; and looking to Niceta, he said, “Go on with what you have
proposed.”</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Simple and Compound.</head>
<p>Then Niceta began as follows:814 “Everything that is, is either simple or compound.
That which is simple is without number, division, colour, difference, roughness, smoothness,
weight, lightness, quality, quantity, and therefore without end. But that which is compound
is either compounded of two, or of three, or even of four elements, or at all events of several;
and things which are compounded can also of necessity be divided.” The old man, hearing
this, said: “You speak most excellently and learnedly, my son.” Then Niceta went on:
“Therefore that which is simple, and which is without any of those things by which that
which subsists can be dissolved, is without doubt incomprehensible and infinite, knowing
neither beginning nor end, and therefore is one and alone, and subsisting without an author.
But that which is compound is subject to number, and diversity, and division,—is necessarily
compounded by some author, and is a diversity collected into one species. That which is
infinite is therefore, in respect of goodness, a Father; in respect of power, a Creator. Nor
can the power of creating cease in the Infinite, nor the goodness be quiescent; but He is
impelled by goodness to change existing things, and by power to arrange and strengthen
them. Therefore some things, as we have said, are changed, and composed of two or three,
some of four, others of more elements. But since our inquiry at present is concerning the
method of the world and its substance, which, it is agreed, is compounded of four elements,
to which all those ten differences belong which we have mentioned above, let us begin at
these lower steps, and come to the higher. For a way is afforded us to intellectual and invisible
things from those which we see and handle; as is contained in arithmetical instructions,
where, when inquiry is made concerning divine things, we rise from the lower to the higher
numbers; but when the method respecting present and visible things is expounded, the order
is directed from the higher to the lower numbers. Is it not so?”</p>
<note type="footnote">814 [The argument of Niceta (chaps. 9–34), while it necessarily includes statements occurring elsewhere in

<pb n="488"/>
<head>Chapter X.—Creation Implies Providence.</head>
<p>Then the old man said: “You are following it out exceedingly well.” Then Niceta: “Now,
then, we must inquire concerning the method of the world; of which the first inquiry is divided
into two parts. For it is asked whether it has been made or not? And if it has not been
made, itself must be that Unbegotten from which all things are. But if it has been made,
concerning this again the question is divided into two parts, whether it was made by itself,
or by another. And if indeed it was made by itself, then without doubt providence is excluded.
If providence is not admitted, in vain is the mind incited to virtue, in vain justice
is maintained, if there be no one to render to the just man according to his merits. But even
the soul itself will not appear to be immortal, if there be no dispensation of providence to
receive it after its escape from the body.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="489"/>
<head>Chapter XI.—General or Special Providence.</head>
<p>“Now, if it be taught that there is a providence, and that the world was made by it, other
questions meet us which must be discussed. For it will be asked, In what way providence
acts, whether generally towards the whole, or specially towards the parts, or generally also
towards the parts, or both generally towards the whole, and specially towards the parts?
But by general providence we mean this: as if God, at first making the world, has given an
order and appointed a course to things, and has ceased to take any further care of what is
done. But special providence towards the parts is of this sort, that He exercises providence
over some men or places, but not over others. But general over all, and at the same time
special over the parts, is in this wise: if God made all things at first, and exercises providence
over each individual even to the end, and renders to every one according to his deeds.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="490"/>
<head>Chapter XII.—Prayer Inconsistent with Genesis.</head>
<p>“Therefore that first proposition, which declares that God made all things in the beginning,
and having imposed a course and order upon things, takes no further account of them,
affirms that all things are done according to genesis. To this, therefore, we shall first reply;
and especially to those who worship the gods and defend genesis. Assuredly, these men,
when they sacrifice to the gods and pray to them, hope that they shall obtain something in
opposition to genesis, and so they annul genesis. But when they laugh at those who incite
to virtue and exhort to continence, and say that nobody can do or suffer anything unless
what is decreed to him by fate, they assuredly cut up by the roots all worship of the Divinity.
For why should you worship those from whom you can obtain nothing which the method
of what is decreed does not allow? Let this suffice in the meantime, in opposition to these
men. But I say that the world is made by God, and that it is at some time to be destroyed
by Him, that that world may appear which is eternal, and which is made for this end, that
it may be always, and that it may receive those who, in the judgment of God, are worthy of
it. But that there is another and invisible world, which contains this visible world within
itself,—after we have finished our discussion concerning the visible world, we shall come
to it also.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="491"/>
<head>Chapter XIII.—A Creator Necessary.</head>
<p>“Now, in the meantime, that this visible world has been made, very many wise men
among the philosophers do testify. But that we may not seem to make use of assertions as
witnesses, as though we needed them, let us inquire, if you please, concerning its principles.
That this visible world is material, is sufficiently evident from the fact that it is visible. But
every body receives one of two Differentiæ; for it is either compact and solid, or divided and
separate. And if the body of which the world was made was compact and solid, and that
body was parted and divided through diverse species and parts according to its differences,
there must necessarily be understood to have been some one to separate the body which
was compact and solid, and to draw it into many parts and diverse forms; or if all this mass
of the world was compounded and compacted from diverse and dispersed parts of bodies,
still there must be understood to have been some one to collect into one the dispersed parts,
and to invest these things with their different species.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="492"/>
<head>Chapter XIV.—Mode of Creation.</head>
<p>“And, indeed, I know that several of the philosophers were rather of this opinion, that
God the Creator made divisions and distinctions from one body, which they call Matter,
which yet consisted of four elements, mingled into one by a certain tempering of divine
providence. For I think that what some have said is vain, that the body of the world is simple,
that is, without any conjunction; since it is evident that what is simple can neither be a body,
nor can be mixed, or propagated, or dissolved; all which, we see, happen to the bodies of
the world. For how could it be dissolved if it were simple, and had not within it that from
which it might be resolved and divided? But if bodies seem to be composed of two, or three,
or even of four elements,—who that has even a small portion of sense does not perceive that
there must have been some one who collected several into one, and preserving the measure
of tempering, made a solid body out of diverse parts? This some one, therefore, we call God,
the Creator of the world, and acknowledge Him as the author of the universe.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<pb n="493"/>
<head>Chapter XV.—Theories of Creation.</head>
<p>“For the Greek philosophers, inquiring into the beginnings of the world, have gone,
some in one way and some in another. In short, Pythagoras says that numbers are the elements
of its beginnings; Callistratus, that qualities; Alcmæon, that contrarieties; Anaximander,
that immensity; Anaxagoras, that equalities of parts; Epicurus, that atoms; Diodorus,
that ἀμερῆ, that is, things in which there are no parts; Asclepius, that ὄγκοι, which we may
call tumours or swellings; the geometricians, that ends; Democritus, that ideas; Thales, that
water; Heraclitus, that fire; Diogenes, that air; Parmenides, that earth; Zeno, Empedocles,
Plato, that fire, water, air, and earth. Aristotle also introduces a fifth element, which he
called ἀκατονόμαστον; that is, that which cannot be named; without doubt indicating Him
who made the world, by joining the four elements into one. Whether, therefore, there be
two, or three, or four, or more, or innumerable elements, of which the world consists, in
every supposition there is shown to be a God, who collected many into one, and again drew
them, when collected, into diverse species; and by this it is proved that the machine of the
world could not have subsisted without a maker and a disposer.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="494"/>
<head>Chapter XVI.—The World Made of Nothing by a Creator.</head>
<p>“But from this fact also, that in the conjunction of the elements, if one be deficient or
in excess, the others are loosened and fall, is shown that they took their beginning from
nothing. For if for example, moisture be wanting in any body, neither will the dry stand;
for dry is fed by moisture, as also cold by heat; in which, as we have said, if one be defective,
the whole are dissolved. And in this they give indications of their origin, that they were
made out of nothing. Now if matter itself is proved to have been made, how shall its parts
and its species, of which the world consists, be thought to be unmade? But about matter
and its qualities this is not the time to speak: only let it suffice to have taught this, that God
is the Creator of all things, because neither, if the body of which the world consists was solid
and united, could it be separated and distinguished without a Creator; nor, if it was collected
into one from diverse and separate parts, could it be collected and mixed without a Maker.
Therefore, if God is so clearly shown to be the Creator of the world, what room is there for
Epicurus to introduce atoms, and to assert that not only sensible bodies, but even intellectual
and rational minds, are made of insensible corpuscles?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<pb n="495"/>
<head>Chapter XVII.—Doctrine of Atoms Untenable.</head>
<p>“But you will say, according to the opinion of Epicurus, that successions of atoms
coming in a ceaseless course, and mixing with one another, and conglomerating through
unlimited and endless periods of time, are made solid bodies. I do not treat this opinion as
a pure fiction, and that, too, a badly contrived one; but let us examine it, whatever be its
character, and see if what is said can stand. For they say that those corpuscles, which they
call atoms, are of different qualities: that some are moist, and therefore heavy, and tending
downwards; others dry and earthy, and therefore still heavy; but others fiery, and therefore
always pushing upwards; others cold and inert, and always remaining in the middle. Since
then some, as being fiery, always tend upward, and others, as being moist and dry, always
downwards, and others keep a middle and unequal course, how could they meet together
and form one body? For if any one throw down from a height small pieces of straw, for
example, and pieces of lead of the same size, will the light straws be able to keep up with the
pieces of lead, though they be equal in size? Nay; the heavier reach the bottom far more
quickly. So also atoms, though they be equal in size, yet, being unequal in weight, the
lighter will never be able to keep pace with the heavier; but if they cannot keep pace, certainly
neither can they be mixed or form one body.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<pb n="496"/>
<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Concourse of Atoms Could Not Make the World.</head>
<p>“Then, in the next place, if they are ceaselessly borne about, and always coming, and
being added to things whose measure is already complete, how can the universe stand, when
new weights are always being heaped upon so vast weights? And this also I ask: If this expanse
of heaven which we see was constructed by the gradual concurrence of atoms, how
did it not collapse while it was in construction, if indeed the yawning top of the structure
was not propped and bound by any stays? For as those who build circular domes, unless
they bind the fastening of the central top, the whole falls at once; so also the circle of the
world, which we see to be brought together in so graceful a form, if it was not made at once,
and under the influence of a single forth-putting of divine energy by the power of a Creator,
but by atoms gradually concurring and constructing it, not as reason demanded, but as a
fortuitous issue befell, how did it not fall down and crumble to pieces before it could be
brought together and fastened? And further, I ask this: What is the pavement on which
the foundations of such an immense mass are laid? And again, what you call the pavement,
on what does it rest? And again that other, what supports it? And so I go on asking, until
the answer comes to nothing and vacuity!</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
<pb n="497"/>
<head>Chapter XIX.—More Difficulties of the Atomic Theory.</head>
<p>“But if any one say that atoms of a fiery quality, being joined together, formed a body,
and because the quality of fire does not tend downwards, but upwards, that the nature of
fire, always pushing upwards, supports the mass of the world placed upon it; to this we answer:
How could atoms of a fiery quality, which always make for the highest place, descend
to the lower, and be found in the lowest place of all, so as to form a foundation for all;
whereas rather the heavier qualities, that is, the earthy or watery, always come before the
lighter, as we have said; hence, also, they assert that the heaven, as the higher structure, is
composed of fiery atoms, which are lighter, and always fly upwards? Therefore the world
cannot have foundations of fire, or any other: nor can there be any association or compacting
of the heavier atoms with the lighter, that is, of those which are always borne downwards,
with those that always fly upwards. Thus it is sufficiently shown that the bodies of the world
are consolidated by the union of atoms; and that insensible bodies, even if they could by
any means concur and be united, could not give forms and measures to bodies, form limbs,
or effect qualities, or express quantities; all which, therefore, by their exactness, attest the
hand of a Maker, and show the operation of reason, which reason I call the Word, and God.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="498"/>
<head>Chapter XX.—Plato’s Testimony.</head>
<p>“But some one will say that these things are done by nature. Now, in this, the controversy
is about a name. For while it is evident that it is a work of mind and reason, what you call
nature, I call God the Creator. It is evident that neither the species of bodies, arranged with
so necessary distinctions, nor the faculties of minds, could or can be made by irrational and
senseless work. But if you regard the philosophers as fit witnesses, Plato testifies concerning
these things in the Timæus, where, in a discussion on the making of the world, he asks,
whether it has existed always, or had a beginning, and decides that it was made. ‘For,’ says
he, ‘it is visible and palpable, and corporeal; but it is evident that all things which are of this
sort have been made; but what has been made has doubtless an author, by whom it was
made. This Maker and Father of all, however, it is difficult to discover; and when discovered,
it is impossible to declare Him to the vulgar.’ Such is the declaration of Plato; but though
he and the other Greek philosophers had chosen to be silent about the making of the world,
would it not be manifest to all who have any understanding? For what man is there, having
even a particle of sense, who, when he sees a house having all things necessary for useful
purposes, its roof fashioned into the form of a globe, painted with various splendour and
diverse figures, adorned with large and splendid lights; who is there, I say, that, seeing such
a structure, would not immediately pronounce that it was constructed by a most wise and
powerful artificer? And so, who can be found so foolish, as, when he gazes upon the fabric
of the heaven, perceives the splendour of the sun and moon, sees the courses and beauty of
the stars, and their paths assigned to them by fixed laws and periods, will not cry out that
these things are made, not so much by a wise and rational artificer, as by wisdom and reason
itself?</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Mechanical Theory.</head>
<p>“But if you would rather have the opinions of others of the Greek philosophers,—and
you are acquainted with mechanical science,—you are of course familiar with what is their
deliverance concerning the heavens. For they suppose a sphere, equally rounded in every
direction, and looking indifferently to all points, and at equal distances in all directions from
the centre of the earth, and so stable by its own symmetry, that its perfect equality does not
permit it to fall off to any side; and so the sphere is sustained, although supported by no
prop. Now if the fabric of the world really has this form, the divine work is evident in it.
But if, as others think, the sphere is placed upon the waters, and is supported by them, or
floating in them, even so the work of a great contriver is shown in it.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Motions of the Stars.</head>
<p>“But lest the assertion may seem doubtful respecting things which are not manifest to
all, let us come to those things of which nobody is ignorant. Who disposed the courses of
the stars with so great reason, ordained their risings and settings, and appointed to each
one to accomplish the circuit of the heavens in certain and regular times? Who assigned to
some to be always approaching to the setting, and others to be returning to the rising? Who
put a measure upon the courses of the sun, that he might mark out, by his diverse motions,
hours, and days, and months, and changes of seasons?—that he might distinguish, by the
sure measurement of his course, now winter, then spring, summer, and afterwards autumn,
and always, by the same changes of the year, complete the circle with variety, without confusion?
Who, I say, will not pronounce that the director of such order is the very wisdom
of God? And these things we have spoken according to the relations given us by the Greeks
respecting the science of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Providence in Earthly Things.</head>
<p>“But what of those things also which we see on the earth, or in the sea? Are we not
plainly taught, that not only the work, but also the providence, of God is in them? For
whereas there are on the earth lofty mountains in certain places, the object of this is, that the
air, being compressed and confined by them through the appointment of God, may be
forced and pressed out into winds, by which fruits may germinate, and the summer heat
may be moderated when the Pleiades glow, fired with the blaze of the sun. But you still say,
Why that blaze of the sun, that moderating should be required? How, then, should fruits
be ripened which are necessary for the uses of men? But observe this also, that at the meridian
axis,815 where the heat is greatest, there is no great collection of clouds, nor an
abundant fall of rain, lest disease should be produced among the inhabitants; for watery
clouds, if they are acted on by rapid heat, render the air impure and pestilential. And the
earth also, receiving the warm rain, does not afford nourishment to the crops, but destruction.
In this who can doubt that there is the working of divine providence? In short, Egypt,
which is scorched with the heat of Æthiopia, in its neighbourhood, lest its air should be incurably
vitiated by the effects of showers, its plains do not receive rain furnished to them
from the clouds, but, as it were, an earthly shower from the overflow of the Nile.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Rivers and Seas.</head>
<p>“What shall we say of fountains and rivers, which flow with perpetual motion into the
sea? And, by the divine providence, neither does their abundant supply fail, nor does the
sea, though it receives so great quantities of water, experience any increase, but both those
elements which contribute to it and those which are thus contributed remain in the same
proportion. But you will say to me: The salt water naturally consumes the fresh water which
is poured into it. Well, in this is manifest the work of providence, that it made that element
salt into which it turned the courses of all the waters which it had provided for the use of
men. So that through so great spaces of time the channel of the sea has not been filled, and
produced a deluge destructive to the earth and to men. Nor will any one be so foolish as to
think that this so great reason and so great providence has been arranged by irrational
nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Plants and Animals.</head>
<p>“But what shall I say of plants, and what of animals? Is it not providence that has ordained
that plants, when they decay by old age, should be reproduced by the suckers or the
seeds which they have themselves produced, and animals by propagation? And by a certain
wonderful dispensation of providence, milk is prepared in the udders of the dams for the
animals before they are born; and as soon as they are born, with no one to guide them, they
seek out the store of nourishment provided for them. And not only males are produced,
but females also, that by means of both the race may be perpetuated. But lest this should
seem, as some think, to be done by a certain order of nature, and not by the appointment
of the Creator, He has, as a proof and indication of His providence, ordained a few animals
to preserve their stock on the earth in an exceptional way: for example, the crow conceives
through the mouth, and the weasel brings forth through the ear; and some birds, such as
hens, sometimes produce eggs conceived of wind or dust; other animals convert the male
into the female, and change their sex every year, as hares and hyænas, which they call
monsters; others spring from the earth, and get their bodies from it, as moles; others from
ashes, as vipers; others from putrifying flesh, as wasps from horseflesh, bees from ox-flesh;
others from cow-dung, as beetles; others from herbs, as the scorpion from the basil; and
again, herbs from animals, as parsley and asparagus from the horn of the stag or the she
goat.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Germination of Seeds.</head>
<p>“And what occasion is there to mention more instances in which divine providence has
ordained the production of animals to be effected in various ways, that order being superseded
which is thought to be assigned by nature, from which not an irrational course of
things, but one arranged by his own reason, might be evinced? And in this also is there not
a full work of providence shown, when seeds sown are prepared by means of earth and water
for the sustenance of men? For when these seeds are committed to the earth, the soil milks
upon the seeds, as from its teats, the moisture which it has received into itself by the will of
God. For there is in water a certain power of the spirit given by God from the beginning,
by whose operation the structure of the body that is to be begins to be formed in the seed
itself, and to be developed by means of the blade and the ear; for the grain of seed being
swelled by the moisture, that power of the spirit which has been made to reside in water,
running as an incorporeal substance through certain strait passages of veins, excites the
seeds to growth, and forms the species of the growing plants. By means, therefore, of the
moist element in which that vital spirit is contained and inborn, it is caused that not only
is it revived, but also that an appearance and form in all respects like to the seeds that had
been sown is reproduced. Now, who that has even a particle of sense will think that this
method depends upon irrational nature, and not upon divine wisdom? Lastly, also these
things are done in a resemblance of the birth of men; for the earth seems to take the place
of the womb, into which the seed being cast, is both formed and nourished by the power of
water and spirit, as we have said above.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Power of Water.</head>
<p>“But in this also the divine providence is to be admired, that it permits us to see and
know the things that are made, but has placed in secrecy and concealment the way and
manner in which they are done, that they may not be competent to the knowledge of the
unworthy, but may be laid open to the worthy and faithful, when they shall have deserved
it. But to prove by facts and examples that nothing is imparted to seeds of the substance of
the earth, but that all depends upon the element of water, and the power of the spirit which
is in it,—suppose, for example, that a hundred talents’ weight of earth are placed in a very
large trough, and that there are sown in it several kinds of seeds, either of herbs or of shrubs,
and that water enough is supplied for watering them, and that that care is taken for several
years, and that the seeds which are gathered are stored up, for example of corn or barley
and other sorts separately from year to year, until the seeds of each sort amount to a hundred
talents’ weight, then also let the stalks be pulled up by the roots and weighed; and after all
these have been taken from the trough, let the earth be weighed, it will still give back its
hundred talents’ weight undiminished.816 Whence, then, shall we say that all that weight,
and all the quantity of different seeds and stalks, has come? Does it not appear manifestly
that it has come from the water? For the earth retains entire what is its own, but the water
which has been poured in all through is nowhere, on account of the powerful virtue of the
divine condition, which by the one species of water both prepares the substances of so many
seeds and shrubs, and forms their species, and preserves the kind while multiplying the increase.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—The Human Body.</head>
<p>“From all these things I think it is sufficiently and abundantly evident that all things are
produced; and the universe consists by a designing sense, and not by the irrational operation
of nature. But let us come now, if you please, to our own substance, that is, the substance
of man, who is a small world, a microcosm, in the great world; and let us consider with what
reason it is compounded: and from this especially you will understand the wisdom of the
Creator. For although man consists of different substances, one mortal and the other immortal,
yet, by the skilful contrivance of the Creator, their diversity does not prevent their
union, and that although the substances be diverse and alien the one from the other. For
the one is taken from the earth and formed by the Creator, but the other is given from immortal
substances; and yet the honour of its immortality is not violated by this union. Nor
does it, as some think, consist of reason, and concupiscence, and passion, but rather such
affections seem to be in it, by which it may be moved in each of these directions. For the
body, which consists of bones and flesh, takes its beginning from the seed of a man, which
is extracted from the marrow by warmth, and conveyed into the womb as into a soil, to
which it adheres, and is gradually moistened from the fountain of the blood, and so is
changed into flesh and bones, and is formed into the likeness of him who injected the seed.</p>

<p>“And mark in this the work of the Designer, how He has inserted the bones like pillars,
on which the flesh might be sustained and carried. Then, again, how an equal measure is
preserved on either side, that is, the right and the left, so that foot answers to foot, hand to
hand, and even finger to finger, so that each agrees in perfect equality with each; and also
eye to eye, and ear to ear, which not only are suitable to and matched with each other, but
also are formed fit for necessary uses. The hands, for instance, are so made as to be fit for
work; the feet for walking; the eyes, protected with sentinel eyebrows, to serve the purpose
of sight; the ears so formed for hearing, that, like a cymbal, they vibrate the sound of the
word that falls upon them, and send it inward, and transmit it even in the understanding
of the heart; whereas the tongue, striking against the teeth in speaking, performs the part
of a fiddle-bow. The teeth also are formed, some for cutting and dividing the food, and
handing it over to the inner ones; and these, in their turn, bruise and grind it like a mill,
that it may be more conveniently digested when it is conveyed into the stomach; whence
also they are called grinders.</p>

to abide in the breast, that by their softness they may soothe and cherish the vigour of the
heart, in which the life seems to abide;—the life, I say, not the soul. And what shall I say of
the substance of the blood, which, proceeding as a river from a fountain, and first borne
along in one channel, and then spreading through innumerable veins, as through canals,
irrigates the whole territory of the human body with vital streams, being supplied by the
agency of the liver, which is placed in the right side, for effecting the digestion of food and
turning it into blood? But in the left side is placed the spleen, which draws to itself, and in

But they are made like a membrane, that the parts that are outside of them may gradually
receive moisture, which if it were poured out suddenly would empty the internal parts; and
not hindered by a thick skin, which would render the outside dry, and disturb the whole

<p>“Moreover, the female form, and the cavity of the womb, most suitable for receiving,
and cherishing, and vivifying the germ, who does not believe that it has been made as it is
by reason and foresight?—because in that part alone of her body the female differs from the
male, in which the foetus being placed, is kept and cherished. And again the male differs
from the female only in that part of his body in which is the power of injecting seed and
propagating mankind. And in this there is a great proof of providence, from the necessary
difference of members; but more in this, where, under a likeness of form there is found to
be diversity of use and variety of office. For males and females equally have teats, but only
those of the female are filled with milk; that, as soon as they have brought forth, the infant
may find nourishment suited to him. But if we see the members in man arranged with such
method, that in all the rest there is seen to be similarity of form, and a difference only in
those in which their use requires a difference, and we neither see anything superfluous nor
anything wanting in man, nor in woman anything deficient or in excess, who will not, from
all these things, acknowledge the operation of reason, and the wisdom of the Creator?</p>

<p>“With this agrees also the reasonable difference of other animals, and each one being

of herbs, varying both in form and in juices. This also is asserted by the change of seasons,
distinguished into four periods, and the circle closing the year with certain hours, days,
months, and not deviating from the appointed reckoning by a single hour. Hence, in short,
the age of the world itself is reckoned by a certain and fixed account, and a definite number

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Time of Making the World.</head>
<p>“But you will say, When was the world made? And why so late? This you might have
objected, though it had been made sooner. For you might say, Why not also before this?
And so, going back through unmeasured ages, you might still ask, And why not sooner?
But we are not now discussing this, why it was not made sooner; but whether it was made
at all. For if it is manifest that it was made, it is necessarily the work of a powerful and supreme
Artificer; and if this is evident, it must be left to the choice and judgment of the wise
Artificer when He should please to make it; unless indeed you think that all this wisdom,
which has constructed the immense fabric of the world, and has given to the several objects
their forms and kinds, assigning to them a habit not only in accordance with beauty, but
also most convenient and necessary for their future uses,—unless, I say, you think that this
alone has escaped it, that it should choose a convenient season for so magnificent a work
of creation. He has doubtless a certain reason and evident causes why, and when, and how
He made the world; but it were not proper that these should be disclosed to those who are
reluctant to inquire into and understand the things which are placed before their eyes, and
which testify of His providence. For those things which are kept in secret, and are hidden
within the senses of Wisdom, as in a royal treasury, are laid open to none but those who
have learned of Him, with whom these things are sealed and laid up. It is God, therefore,
who made all things, and Himself was made by none. But those who speak of nature instead
of God, and declare that all things were made by nature, do not perceive the mistake of the
name which they use. For if they think that nature is irrational, it is most foolish to suppose
that a rational creature can proceed from an irrational creator. But if it is Reason—that is,
Logos817—by which it appears that all things were made, they change the name without
purpose, when they make statements concerning the reason of the Creator. If you have
anything to say to these things, my father, say on.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—A Contest of Hospitality.</head>
<p>When Niceta had thus spoken, the old man answered: “You indeed, my son, have
conducted your argument wisely and vigorously; so much so, that I do not think the subject
of providence could be better treated. But as it is now late, I wish to say some things tomorrow
in answer to what you have argued; and if on these you can satisfy me, I shall confess
myself a debtor to your favour.” And when the old man said this, Peter rose up. Then one
of those present, a chief man of the Laodiceans, requested of Peter and us that he might give
the old man other clothes instead of the mean and torn ones that he wore.818 This man
Peter and we embraced; and praising him for his honourable and excellent intention, said:
“We are not so foolish and impious as not to bestow the things which are necessary for
bodily uses upon him to whom we have committed so precious words; and we hope that he
will willingly receive them, as a father from his sons, and also we trust that he will share
with us our house and our living.” While we said this, and that chief man of the city strove
to take the old man away from us with the greatest urgency and with many blandishments,
while we the more eagerly strove to keep him with us, all the people cried out that it should
rather be done as the old man himself pleased; and when silence was obtained, the old man,
with an oath, said: “To-day I shall stay with no one, nor take anything from any one, lest
the choice of the one should prove the sorrow of the other; afterwards these things may be,
if so it seem right.”</p>

but we will accept from you favour for favour. Show us your house, and make it ready, so
that the discussion which is to be to-morrow may be held there, and that any who wish to

greatly; and all the people also heard it gladly. And when the crowds had dispersed, he
pointed out his house; and the old man also was preparing to depart. But I commanded
one of my attendants to follow the old man secretly, and find out where he stayed. And

<p>But on the following day Peter arose early and called us, and we went together to the
secret place in which we had been on the previous day, for the purpose of prayer. And when,
after prayer, we were coming thence to the appointed place, he exhorted us by the way,
saying:819 “Hear me, most beloved fellow-servants: It is good that every one of you, according
to his ability, contribute to the advantage of those who are approaching to the faith of
our religion; and therefore do not shrink from instructing the ignorant, and teaching according
to the wisdom which has been bestowed upon you by the providence of God, yet so that
you only join the eloquence of your discourse with those things which you have heard from
me, and which have been committed to you. But do not speak anything which is your own,
and which has not been committed to you, though it may seem to yourselves to be true; but
hold forth those things, as I have said, which I myself have received from the true Prophet,
and have delivered to you, although they may seem to be less full of authority. For thus it
often happens that men turn away from the truth, while they believe that they have found
out, by their own thoughts, a form of truth more true and powerful.”</p>

and each one elucidating his own questions. Now, then, as Niceta discoursed sufficiently
yesterday, let Aquila conduct the discussion to-day; and after Aquila, Clement; and then I,
if the case shall require it, will add something.” Meantime, while we were talking in this
way, we came to the house; and the master of the house welcomed us, and led us to a certain
apartment, arranged after the manner of a theatre, and beautifully built. There we found
great crowds waiting for us, who had come during the night, and amongst them the old
man who had argued with us yesterday. Therefore we entered, having Peter in the midst
of us, looking about if we could see the old man anywhere; and when Peter saw him hiding
in the midst of the crowd, he called him to him, saying: “Since you possess a soul more enlightened
than most, why do you hide yourself, and conceal yourself in modesty? Rather
come hither, and propound your sentiments.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—Recapitulation of Yesterday’s Argument.</head>
<p>When Peter had thus spoken, immediately the crowd began to make room for the old
man.820 And when he had come forward, he thus began: “Although I do not remember
the words of the discourse which the young man delivered yesterday, yet I recollect the
purport and the order of it; and therefore I think it necessary, for the sake of those who were
not present yesterday, to call up what was said, and to repeat everything shortly, that, although
something may have escaped me, I may be reminded of it by him who delivered the discourse,
who is now present. This, then, was the purport of yesterday’s discussion: that all things
that we see, inasmuch as they consist in a certain proportion, and art, and form, and species,
must be believed to have been made by intelligent power; but if it be mind and reason that
has formed them, it follows that the world is governed by the providence of the same reason,
although the things which are done in the world may seem to us to be not quite rightly
done. But it follows, that if God and mind is the creator of all things, He must also be just;
but if He is just, He necessarily judges. If He judges, it is of necessity that men be judged
with respect to their doings; and if every one is judged in respect of his doings, there shall
at some time be a righteous separation between righteous men and sinners. This, I think,
was the substance of the whole discourse.</p>
<note type="footnote">820 [The second day’s discussion, in which Aquila is the main speaker, is also of a high order. It is, as already

<head>Chapter XL.—Genesis.</head>
<p>“If, therefore, it can be shown that mind and reason created all things, it follows that
those things which come after are also managed by reason and providence. But if unintelligent
and blind nature produces all things, the reason of judgment is undoubtedly overthrown;
and there is no ground to expect either punishment of sin or reward of well-doing where
there is no judge. Since, then, the whole matter depends upon this, and hangs by this head,
do not take it amiss, if I wish this to be discussed and handled somewhat more fully. For
in this the first gate, as it were, is shut towards all things which are propounded, and therefore
I wish first of all to have it opened to me. Now therefore hear what my doctrine is; and if
any one of you pleases, let him reply to me: for I shall not be ashamed to learn, if I hear that
which is true, and to assent to him who speaks rightly. The discourse, then, which you delivered
yesterday, which asserted that all things consist by art, and measure, and reason,
does not fully persuade me that it is mind and reason that has made the world; for I have
many things which I can show to consist by competent measure, and form, and species, and
which yet were not made by mind and reason. Then, besides, I see that many things are
done in the world without arrangement, consequence, or justice, and that nothing can be
done without the course of Genesis. This I shall in the sequel prove most clearly from my
own case.”</p>

<p>When the old man had thus spoken, Aquila answered: “As you yourself proposed that
any one who pleased should have an opportunity of answering to what you might say, my
brother Niceta permits me to conduct the argument today.” Then the old man: “Go on,
my son, as you please.” And Aquila answered: “You promised that you would show that
there are many things in the world which have a form and species arranged by equal reason,
which yet it is evident were not effected by God as their Creator. Now, then, as you have
promised, point out these things.” Then said the old man: “Behold, we see the bow in the
heaven assume a circular shape, completed in all proportion, and have an appearance of
reality, which perhaps neither mind could have constructed nor reason described; and yet
it is not made by any mind. Behold, I have set forth the whole in a word: now answer me.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
<pb n="520"/>
<head>Chapter XLII.—Types and Forms.</head>
<p>Then said Aquila: “If anything is expressed from a type and form, it is at once understood
that it is from reason, and that it could not be made without mind; since the type itself,
which expresses figures and forms, was not made without mind. For example, if wax be
applied to an engraved ring, it takes the stamp and figure from the ring, which undoubtedly
is without sense; but then the ring, which expresses the figure, was engraven by the hand of
a workman, and it was mind and reason that gave the type to the ring. So then the bow also
is expressed in the air; for the sun, impressing its rays on the clouds in the process of rarefaction,
and affixing the type of its circularity to the cloudy moisture, as it were to soft wax,
produces the appearance of a bow; and this, as I have said, is effected by the reflection of
the sun’s brightness upon the clouds, and reproducing the brightness of its circle from them.
Now this does not always take place, but only when the opportunity is presented by the
rarefaction of moistened clouds. And consequently, when the clouds again are condensed
and unite, the form of the bow is dissolved and vanishes. Finally, the bow never is seen
without sun and clouds, just as the image is not produced, unless there be the type, and wax,
or some other material. Nor is it wonderful if God the Creator in the beginning made types,
from which forms and species may now be expressed. But this is similar to that, that in the
beginning God created insensible elements, which He might use for forming and developing
all other things. But even those who form statues, first make a mould of clay or wax, and
from it the figure of the statue is produced. And then afterwards a shadow is also produced
from the statue, which shadow always bears the form and likeness of the statue. What shall
we say then? That the insensible statue forms a shadow finished with as diligent care as the
statue itself? Or shall the finishing of the shadow be unhesitatingly ascribed to him who
has also fashioned the statue?</p>

<p>“If, then, it seems to you that this is so, and what has been said on this subject is enough,
let us come to inquire into other matters; or if you think that something is still wanting, let
us go over it again.” And the old man said: “I wish you would go over this again, since
there are many other things which I see to be made in like manner: for both the fruits of
trees are produced in like manner, beautifully formed and wonderfully rounded; and the
appearance of the leaves is formed with immense gracefulness, and the green membrane is
woven with exquisite art: then, moreover, fleas, mice, lizards, and such like, shall we say
that these are made by God? Hence, from these vile objects a conjecture is derived concerning
the superior, that they are by no means formed by the art of mind.” “You infer well,” said
Aquila, “concerning the texture of leaves, and concerning small animals, that from these
belief is withdrawn from the superior creatures; but let not these things deceive you, that
you should think that God, working as it were only with two hands, could not complete all
things that are made; but remember how my brother Niceta answered you yesterday, and
truly disclosed the mystery before the time, as a son speaking with his father, and explained
why and how things are made which seem to be useless.”</p>

<p>Then the old man: “I should like to hear from you why those useless things are made
by the will of that supreme mind?” “If,” said he, “it is fully manifest to you that there is in
them the work of mind and reason, then you will not hesitate to say also why they were
made, and to declare that they have been rightly made.” To this the old man answered: “I
am not able, my son, to say that those things which seem formed by art are made by mind,
by reason of other things which we see to be done unjustly and disorderly in the world.”
“If,” says Aquila, “those things which are done disorderly do not allow you say that they are
done by the providence of God, why do not those things which are done orderly compel
you to say that they are done by God, and that irrational nature cannot produce a rational
work? For it is certain, nor do we at all deny, that in this world some things are done orderly,
and some disorderly. Those things, therefore, that are done rationally, believe that they are
done by providence; but those that are done irrationally and inordinately, that they befall
naturally, and happen accidentally. But I wonder that men do not perceive, that where there
is sense things may be done ordinately and inordinately, but where there is no sense neither
the one nor the other can be done; for reason makes order, and the course of order necessarily
produces something inordinate, if anything contrary happen to disturb order.” Then
the old man: “This very thing I wish you to show me.”</p>

<head>Chapter XLV.—Motions of the Sun and Moon.</head>
<p>Says Aquila: “I shall do so without delay. Two visible signs are shown in heaven—one
of the sun, the other of the moon; and these are followed by five other stars, each describing
its own separate orbit. These, therefore, God has placed in the heaven, by which the temperature
of the air may be regulated according to the seasons, and the order of vicissitudes and
alternations may be kept. But by means of the very same signs, if at any time plague and
corruption is sent upon the earth for the sins of men, the air is disturbed, pestilence is
brought upon animals, blight upon crops, and a destructive year in every way upon men;
and thus it is that by one and the same means order is both kept and destroyed. For it is
manifest even to the unbelieving and unskilful, that the course of the sun, which is useful
and necessary to the world, and which is assigned by providence, is always kept orderly; but
the courses of the moon, in comparison of the course of the sun, seem to the unskilful to be
inordinate and unsettled in her waxings and wanings. For the sun moves in fixed and orderly
periods: for from him are hours, from him the day when he rises, from him also the night
when he sets; from him months and years are reckoned, from him the variations of seasons
are produced; while, rising to the higher regions, he tempers the spring; but when he reaches
the top of the heaven, he kindles the summer’s heats: again, sinking, he produces the temper
of autumn; and when he returns to his lowest circle, he bequeaths to us the rigour of winter’s
cold from the icy binding of heaven.</p>

meantime, we remark that though he is that good servant for regulating the changes of the
seasons, yet, when chastisement is inflicted upon men according to the will of God, he glows
more fiercely, and burns up the world with more vehement fires. In like manner also the
course of the moon, and that changing which seems to the unskilful to be disorderly, is adapted
to the growth of crops, and cattle, and all living creatures; for by her waxings and
wanings, by a certain wonderful contrivance of providence, everything that is born is
nourished and grows; concerning which we could speak more at length and unfold the
matter in detail, but that the method of the question proposed recalls us. Yet, by the very
same appliances by which they are produced, all things are nourished and increased; but
when, from any just cause, the regulation of the appointed order is changed, corruption and
distemper arise, so that chastisement may come upon men by the will of God, as we have

<p>“But perhaps you will say, What of the fact that, in that common chastisement, like
things befall the pious and the impious? It is true, and we confess it; but the chastisement
turns to the advantage of the pious, that, being afflicted in the present life, they may come
more purified to the future, in which perpetual rest is prepared for them, and that at the
same time even the impious may somewhat profit from their chastisement, or else that the
just sentence of the future judgment may be passed upon them; since in the same chastisements
the righteous give thanks to God, while the unrighteous blaspheme. Therefore, since
the opinion of things is divided into two parts, that some things are done by order and
others against order, it ought, from those things which are done according to order, to be
believed that there is a providence; but with respect to those things which are done against
order, we should inquire their causes from those who have learned them by prophetic
teaching: for those who have become acquainted with prophetic discourse know when, and
for what reason, blight, hail, and pestilence, and such like, have occurred in every generation,
and for what sins these have been sent as a punishment; whence causes of sadness, lamentations,
and griefs have befallen the human race; whence also trembling sickness has ensued,
and that this has been from the beginning the punishment of parricide.821</p>

<head>Chapter XLVIII.—Chastisements for Sins.</head>
<p>“For in the beginning of the world there were none of these evils, but they took their
rise from the impiety of men; and thence, with the constant increase of iniquities, the
number of evils has also increased. But for this reason divine providence has decreed a
judgment with respect to all men, because the present life was not such that every one could
be dealt with according to his deservings. Those things, therefore, which were well and orderly
appointed from the beginning, when no causes of evil existed, are not to be judged of
from the evils which have befallen the world by reason of the sins of men. In short, as an
indication of the things which were from the beginning, some nations are found which are
strangers to these evils. For the Seres, because they live chastely, are kept free from them
all; for with them it is unlawful to come at a woman after she has conceived, or while she is
being purified. No one there eats unclean flesh, no one knows aught of sacrifices; all are
judges to themselves according to justice. For this reason they are not chastened with those
plagues which we have spoken of; they live to extreme old age, and die without sickness.
But we, miserable as we are, dwelling as it were with deadly serpents822—I mean with wicked
men—necessarily suffer with them the plagues of afflictions in this world, but we cherish
hope from the comfort of good things to come.”</p>

from which it should be necessary that the righteous be afflicted with the unrighteous; or if
they did them, He ought to have applied some correction or purification to the world.”823
“God,” said Aquila, “did so command, and gave precepts by the prophets how men ought
to live; but even these precepts they despised: yea, if any desired to observe them, them they
afflicted with various injuries, until they drove them from their purposed observance, and

He saved a certain righteous man, with his sons, in an ark, and with him the race of all plants
and animals.824 And yet even those who sprang from them, after a time, again did deeds
like to those of their predecessors; for those things that had befallen them were forgotten,
so that their descendants did not even believe that the flood had taken place. Wherefore
God also decreed that there should not be another flood in the present world, else there
should have been one in every generation, according to the account of their sins by reason
of their unbelief; but He rather granted that certain angels who delight in evil should bear
sway over the several nations—and to them was given power over individual men, yet only
on this condition, if any one first had made himself subject to them by sinning—until He
should come who delights in good, and by Him the number of the righteous should be
completed, and by the increase of the number of pious men all over the world impiety should
be in some measure repressed, and it should be known to all that all that is good is done by
God.</p>

<p>“But by the freedom of the will, every man, while he is unbelieving in regard to things
to come, by evil deeds runs into evils. And these are the things in the world which seem to
be done contrary to order, which owe their existence to unbelief. Therefore the dispensation
of divine providence is withal to be admired, which granted to those men in the beginning,
walking in the good way of life, to enjoy incorruptible good things; but when they sinned,
they gave birth to evil by sin. And to every good thing evil is joined as by a certain covenant
of alliance on the part of sin, since indeed the earth has been polluted with human blood,
and altars have been lighted to demons, and they have polluted the very air by the filthy
smoke of sacrifices; and so at length the elements, being first corrupted, have handed over
to men the fault of their corruption, as roots communicate their qualities to the branches

<p>“Observe therefore in this, as I have said, how justly divine providence comes to the
help of things vitiated; that, inasmuch as evils which had derived their origin from sin were
associated with the good things of God, He should assign two chiefs to these two departments.
825 And accordingly, to Him who rejoices in good He has appointed the ordering of
good things, that He might bring those who believe in Him to the faith of His providence;
but to him who rejoices in evil, He has given over those things which are done without order
and uselessly, from which of course the faith of His providence comes into doubt; and thus
a just division has been made by a just God. Hence therefore it is, that whereas the orderly
course of the stars produces faith that the world was made by the hand of a designer, on the
other hand, the disturbance of the air, the pestilent breeze, the uncontrolled fire of the
lightning, cast doubt upon the work of providence. For, as we have said, every good thing
has its corresponding contrary evil thing joined with it; as hail is opposite to the fertilizing
showers, the corruption of mildew is associated with the gentle dew, the whirlwinds of
storms are joined with the soft winds, unfruitful trees with fruitful, noxious herbs with
useful, wild and destructive animals with gentle ones. But all these things are arranged by
God, because that the choice of men’s will has departed from the purpose of good, and fallen
away to evil.</p>

<head>Chapter LIII.—Everything Has Its Corresponding Contrary.</head>
<p>“Therefore this division holds in all the things of the world; and as there are pious men,
so there are also impious; as there are prophets, so also there are false prophets; and amongst
the Gentiles there are philosophers and false philosophers. Also the Arabian nations, and
many others, have imitated the circumcision of the Jews for the service of their impiety. So
also the worship of demons is contrary to the divine worship, baptism to baptism, laws to
the law, false apostles to apostles, and false teachers to teachers. And hence it is that among
the philosophers some assert providence, others deny it; some maintain that there is one
God, others that there are more than one: in short, the matter has come to this, that
whereas demons are expelled by the word of God, by which it is declared that there is a
providence, the magical art, for the confirmation of infidelity, has found out ways of imitating
this by contraries. Thus has been discovered the method of counteracting the poison of
serpents by incantations, and the effecting of cures contrary to the word and power of God.
The magic art has also found out ministries contrary to the angels of God, placing the calling
up of souls and the figments of demons in opposition to these. And, not to prolong the
discourse by a further enumeration, there is nothing whatever that makes for the belief of
providence, which has not something, on the other hand, prepared for unbelief; and therefore
they who do not know that division of things, think that there is no providence, by reason
of those things in the world which are discordant from themselves. But do you, my father,
as a wise man, choose from that division the part which preserves order and makes for the
belief of providence, and do not only follow that part which runs against order and neutralizes
the belief of providence.”</p>

<head>Chapter LIV.—An Illustration.</head>
<p>To this the old man answered: “Show me a way, my son, by which I may establish in
my mind one or other of these two orders, the one of which asserts, and the other denies,
providence.” “To one having a right judgment,” says Aquila, “the decision is easy. For this
very thing that you say, order and disorder, may be produced by a contriver, but not by insensible
nature. For let us suppose, by way of illustration, that a great mass were torn from
a high rock, and cast down headlong, and when clashed upon the ground were broken into
many pieces, could it in any way happen that, amongst that multitude of fragments, there
should be found even one which should have any perfect figure and shape?” The old man
answered: “It is impossible.” “But,” said Aquila, “if there be present a statuary, he can by
his skilful hand and reasonable mind form the stone cut from the mountain into whatever
figure he pleases.” The old man said: “That is true.” “Therefore,” says Aquila, “when there
is not a rational mind, no figure can be formed out of the mass; but when there is a designing
mind, there may be both form and deformity: for example, if a workman cuts from the
mountain a block to which he wishes to give a form, he must first cut it out unformed and
rough; then, by degrees hammering and hewing it by the rule of his art, he expresses the
form which he has conceived in his mind. Thus, therefore, from informity or deformity,
by the hand of the workman form is attained, and both proceed from the workman. In like
manner, therefore, the things which are done in the world are accomplished by the providence
of a contriver, although they may seem not quite orderly. And therefore, because these two
ways have been made known to you, and you have heard the divisions of them, flee from
the way of unbelief, lest haply it lead you to that prince who delights in evils; but follow the
way of faith, that you may come to that King who delighteth in good men.”</p>

<p>To this the old man answered: “But why was that prince made who delights in evil?826
And from what was he made? Or was he not made?” Aquila said: “The treatment of that
subject belongs to another time; but that you may not go away altogether without an answer
to this, I shall give a few hints on this subject also. God, foreseeing all things before the
creation of the world, knowing that the men who were to be would some of them indeed
incline to good, but others to the opposite, assigned those who should choose the good to
His own government and His own care, and called them His peculiar inheritance;827 but
He gave over the government of those who should turn to evil to those angels who, not by
their substance, but by opposition, were unwilling to remain with God, being corrupted by
the vice of envy and pride. Those, therefore, he made worthy princes of worthy subjects;
yet he so delivered them over to those angels, that they have not the power of doing what
they will against them, unless they transgress the bounds assigned to them from the beginning.
And this is the bound assigned, that unless one first do the will of the demons, the
demons have no power over him.”</p>

<p>Then the old man said: “You have stated it excellently, my son. It now remains only
that you tell me whence is the substance of evil: for if it was made by God, the evil fruit
shows that the root is in fault; for it appears that it also is of an evil nature. But if this substance
was co-eternal with God, how can that which was equally unproduced and coeternal
be subject to the other?” “It was not always,” said Aquila; “but neither does it necessarily
follow, if it was made by God, that its Creator should be thought to be such as is that
which has been made by Him. For indeed God made the substance of all things; but if a
reasonable mind, which has been made by God, do not acquiesce in the laws of its Creator,
and go beyond the bounds of the temperance prescribed to it, how does this reflect on the
Creator? Or if there is any reason higher than this, we do not know it; for we cannot know
anything perfectly, and especially concerning those things for our ignorance of which we
are not to be judged. But those things for which we are to be judged are most easy to be
understood, and are despatched almost in a word. For almost the whole rule of our actions
is summed up in this, that what we are unwilling to suffer we should not do to others. For
as you would not be killed, you must beware of killing another; and as you would not have
your own marriage violated, you must not defile another’s bed; you would not be stolen
from, neither must you steal; and every matter of men’s actions is comprehended within
this rule.”</p>

words are powerful, yet they cannot lead me to believe that anything can be done apart from
Genesis. For I know that all things have happened to me by the necessity of Genesis,828 and
therefore I cannot be persuaded that either to do well or to do ill is in our power; and if we
have not our actions in our power, it cannot be believed that there is a judgment to come,
by which either punishments may be inflicted on the evil, or rewards bestowed on the good.
In short, since I see that you are initiated in this sort of learning, I shall lay before you a few
things from the art itself.” “If,” says Aquila, “you wish to add anything from that science,
my brother Clement will answer you with all care, since he has attended more fully to the
science of mathematics. For I can maintain in other ways that our actions are in our own
power; but I ought not to presume upon those things which I have not learned.”</p>

you that you have to do with those who are not ignorant of the science which you profess.”
When, therefore, it had been settled between the old man and me, that on the following day
we should hold a discussion on the subject of Genesis—whether all things are done under
its influence, or there be anything in us which is not done by Genesis, but by the judgment
of the mind—Peter rose up, and began to speak to the following effect:829 “To me it is exceedingly
wonderful, that things which can easily be found out men make difficult by recondite
thoughts and words; and those especially who think themselves wise, and who, wishing
to comprehend the will of God, treat God as if He were a man, yea, as if He were something
less than a man: for no one can know the purpose or mind of a man unless he himself reveal
his thoughts; and neither can any one learn a profession unless he be for a long time instructed
by a master. How much more must it be, that no one can know the mind or the work
of the invisible and incomprehensible God, unless He Himself send a prophet to declare
His purpose, and expound the way of His creation, so far as it is lawful for men to learn it!
Hence I think it ridiculous when men judge of the power of God in natural ways, and think
that this is possible and that impossible to Him, or this greater and that less, while they are
ignorant of everything; who, being unrighteous men, judge the righteous God; unskilled,
judge the contriver; corrupt, judge the incorruptible; creatures, judge the Creator.</p>

<p>But I would not have you think, that in saying this I take away the power of judging
concerning things; but I give counsel that no one walk through devious places, and rush
into errors without end. And therefore I advise not only wise men, but indeed all men who
have a desire of knowing what is advantageous to them, that they seek after the true
Prophet; for it is He alone who knoweth all things, and who knoweth what and how every
man is seeking.830 For He is within the mind of every one of us, but in those who have no
desire of the knowledge of God and His righteousness, He is inoperative; but He works in
those who seek after that which is profitable to their souls, and kindles in them the light of
knowledge. Wherefore seek Him first of all; and if you do not find Him, expect not that
you shall learn anything from any other. But He is soon found by those who diligently seek
Him through love of the truth, and whose souls are not taken possession of by wickedness.
For He is present with those who desire Him in the innocency of their spirits, who bear
patiently, and draw sighs from the bottom of their hearts through love of the truth; but He
deserts malevolent minds,831 because as a prophet He knows the thoughts of every one.
And therefore let no one think that he can find Him by his own wisdom, unless, as we have
said, he empty his mind of all wickedness, and conceive a pure and faithful desire to know
Him. For when any one has so prepared himself, He Himself as a prophet, seeing a mind
prepared for Him, of His own accord offers Himself to his knowledge.</p>

by one; for, being mortal, he shall not be able to trace the counsel of God, and to scan immensity
itself. But if, as we have said, he desires to learn all things, let him seek after the
true Prophet; and when he has found Him, let him not treat with Him by questions and
disputations and arguments; but if He has given any response, or pronounced any judgment,
it cannot be doubted that this is certain. And therefore, before all things, let the true
Prophet be sought, and His words be laid hold of. In respect to these this only should be
discussed by every one, that he may satisfy himself if they are truly His prophetic words;
that is, if they contain undoubted faith of things to come, if they mark out definite times, if
they preserve the order of things, if they do not relate as last those things which are first,
nor as first those things which were done last, if they contain nothing subtle, nothing composed
by magic art to deceive, or if they have not transferred to themselves things which
were revealed to others, and have mixed them with falsehoods. And when, all these things

have introduced certain subtile and difficult words, so that not even the terms that
they use in their discourses can be known and understood by all, God has shown that those
who thought themselves word-framers are altogether unskilful as respects the knowledge
of the truth. For the knowledge of things which is imparted by the true Prophet is simple,
and plain, and brief; which those men walking through devious places, and through the
stony difficulties of words, are wholly ignorant of. Therefore, to modest and simple minds,
when they see things come to pass which have been foretold, it is enough, and more than
enough, that they may receive most certain knowledge from most certain prescience; and
for the rest may be at peace, having received evident knowledge of the truth. For all other
things are treated by opinion, in which there can be nothing firm. For what speech is there
which may not be contradicted? And what argument is there that may not be overthrown
by another argument? And hence it is, that by disputation of this sort men can never come
to any end of knowledge and learning, but find the end of their life sooner than the end of
their questions.</p>

<p>“And, therefore, since amongst these philosophers are things uncertain, we must come
to the true Prophet. Him God the Father wished to be loved by all, and accordingly He has
been pleased wholly to extinguish those opinions which have originated with men, and in
regard to which there is nothing like certainty—that He the true Prophet might be the more
sought after, and that He whom833 they had obscured should show to men the way of truth.
For on this account also God made the world, and by Him the world is filled; whence also
He is everywhere near to them who seek Him, though He be sought in the remotest ends
of the earth. But if any one seek Him not purely, nor holily, nor faithfully, He is indeed
within him, because He is everywhere, and is found within the minds of all men; but, as we
have said before, He is dormant to the unbelieving, and is held to be absent from those by
whom His existence is not believed.” And when Peter had said this, and more to the same
effect, concerning the true Prophet, he dismissed the crowds; and when he very earnestly
entreated the old man to remain with us, he could prevail nothing; but he also departed, to
return next day, as had been agreed upon. And after this, we also, with Peter, went to our

<p>On the following day, Peter, along with us, hastened early to the place in which the
discussion had been held the day before; and when he saw that great crowds had assembled
there to hear, and saw the old man with them, he said to him:834 “Old man, it was agreed
yesterday that you should confer to-day with Clement; and that you should either show that
nothing takes place apart from genesis, or that Clement should prove that there is no such
thing as genesis, but that what we do is in our own power.” To this the old man answered:
“I both remember what was agreed upon, and I keep in memory the words which you spoke
after the agreement was made, in which you taught that it is impossible for man to know
any thing, unless he learn from the true Prophet.” Then Peter said: “You do not know what
I meant; but I shall now explain to you. I spoke of the will and purpose of God, which He
had before the world was, and by which purpose He made the world, appointed times, gave
the law, promised a world to come to the righteous for the rewarding of their good deeds,
and decreed punishments to the unjust according to a judicial sentence. I said that this
counsel and this will of God cannot be found out by men, because no man can gather the
mind of God from conjectures and opinion, unless a prophet sent by Him declare it. I did
not therefore speak of any doctrines or studies, that they cannot be found out or known
without a prophet; for I know that both arts and sciences can be known and practised by
men, which they have learned, not from the true Prophet, but from human instructors.</p>

<p>“Since, therefore, you profess to be conversant with the position of the stars and the
courses of the heavenly bodies, and that from these you can convince Clement that all things
are subject to Genesis, or that you will learn from him that all things are governed by
providence, and that we have something in our own power, it is now time for you two to
set about this.” To this the old man answered: “Now indeed it was not necessary to raise
questions of this kind, if it were possible for us to learn from the true Prophet, and to hear
in a definite proposition, that anything depends on us and on the freedom of our will; for
your yesterday’s discourse affected me greatly, in which you disputed concerning the
prophetic power.835 Whence also I assent to and confirm your judgment, that nothing can
be known by man with certainty, and without doubt, seeing that he has but a short period
of life, and a brief and slender breath, by which he seems to be kept in life. However, since
I am understood to have promised to Clement, before I heard anything of the prophetic
power, that I should show that all things are subject to Genesis, or that I should learn from
him that there is something in ourselves, let him do me this favour, that he first begin, and
propound and explain what may be objected: for I, ever since I heard from you a few words
concerning the power of prophecy, have, I confess, been confounded, considering the
greatness of prescience; nor do I think that anything ought to be received which is collected
from conjectures and opinion.”</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Beginning of the Discussion.</head>
<p>When the old man had said this, I Clement began to speak as follows: “God by His Son
created the world as a double house, separated by the interposition of this firmament, which
is called heaven; and appointed angelic powers to dwell in the higher, and a multitude of
men to be born in this visible world, from amongst whom He might choose friends for His
Son, with whom He might rejoice, and who might be prepared for Him as a beloved bride
for a bridegroom. But even till the time of the marriage, which is the manifestation of the
world to come, He has appointed a certain power, to choose out and watch over the good
ones of those who are born in this world, and to preserve them for His Son, set apart in a
certain place of the world, which is without sin; in which there are already some, who are
there being prepared, as I said, as a bride adorned for the coming of the bridegroom. For
the prince of this world and of the present age is like an adulterer, who corrupts and violates
the minds of men, and, seducing them from the love of the true bridegroom, allures them
to strange lovers.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="544"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—Why the Evil Prince Was Made.</head>
<p>But some one will say, How then was it necessary that that prince should be made, who
was to turn away the minds of men from the true prince?836 Because God, who, as I have
said, wished to prepare friends for His Son, did not wish them to be such as by necessity of
nature could not be aught else, but such as should desire of their own choice and will to be
good; because neither is that praiseworthy which is not desirable, nor is that judged to be
good which is not sought for with purpose. For there is no credit in being that from which
the necessity of your nature does not admit of your changing. Therefore the providence of
God has willed that a multitude of men should be born in this world, that those who should
choose a good life might be selected from many. And because He foresaw that the present
world could not consist except by variety and inequality, He gave to each mind freedom of
motions,837 according to the diversities of present things, and appointed this prince, through
his suggestion of those things which run contrary, that the choice of better things might
depend upon the exercise of virtue.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Necessity of Inequality.</head>
<p>“But to make our meaning plainer, we shall explain it by particulars. Was it proper, for
example, that all men in this world should be kings, or princes, or lords, or teachers, or
lawyers, or geometers, or goldsmiths, or bakers, or smiths, or grammarians, or rich men,
or farmers, or perfumers, or fishermen, or poor men? It is certain that all could not be
these. Yet all these professions, and many more, the life of men requires, and without these
it cannot be passed; therefore inequality is necessary in this world. For there cannot be a
king, unless he has subjects over whom he may rule and reign; nor can there be a master,
unless he has one over whom he may bear sway; and in like manner of the rest.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="546"/>
<head>Chapter VI.—Arrangements of the World for the Exercise of Virtue.</head>
<p>“Therefore the Creator, knowing that no one would come to the contest of his own accord,
while labour is shunned,—that is, to the practice of those professions which we have
mentioned, by means of which either the justice or the mercy of every one can be manifested,—
made for men a body susceptible of hunger, and thirst, and cold, in order that men,
being compelled for the sake of supporting their bodies, might come down to all the professions
which we have mentioned, by the necessity of livelihood. For we are taught to cultivate
every one of these arts, for the sake of food, and drink, and clothing. And in this the purpose
of each one’s mind is shown, whether he will supply the demands of hunger and cold by
means of thefts, and murders, and perjuries, and other crimes of that sort; or whether,
keeping justice and mercy and continence, he will fulfil the service of imminent necessity
by the practice of a profession and the labour of his hands. For if he supply his bodily wants
with justice, and piety, and mercy, he comes forth as a victor in the contest set before him,
and is chosen as a friend of the Son of God. But if he serve carnal lusts, by frauds, iniquities,
and crimes, he becomes a friend of the prince of this world, and of all demons; by whom he
is also taught this, to ascribe to the courses of the stars the errors of his own evil doings, although
he chose them of purpose, and willingly. For arts are learned and practised, as we
have said, under the compulsion of the desire of food and drink; which desire, when the
knowledge of the truth comes to any one, becomes weaker, and frugality takes its place.
For what expense have those who use water and bread, and only expect it from God?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="547"/>
<head>Chapter VII.—The Old and the New Birth.</head>
<p>“There is therefore, as we have said, a certain necessary inequality in the dispensation
of the world. Since indeed all men cannot know all things, and accomplish all works, yet
all need the use and service of almost all. And on this account it is necessary that one work,
and another pay him for his work; that one be servant, and another be master; that one be
subject, another be king. But this inequality, which is a necessary provision for the life of
men, divine providence has turned into an occasion of justice, mercy, and humanity: that
while these things are transacted between man and man, every one may have an opportunity
of acting justly with him to whom he has to pay wages for his work; and of acting mercifully
to him who, perhaps through sickness or poverty, cannot pay his debt; and of acting humanely
towards those who by their creation seem to be subject to him; also of maintaining gentleness
towards subjects, and of doing all things according to the law of God. For He has given a
law, thereby aiding the minds of men, that they may the more easily perceive how they ought
to act with respect to everything, in what way they may escape evil, and in what way tend
to future blessings; and how, being regenerate in water, they may by good works extinguish
the fire of their old birth. For our first birth descends through the fire of lust, and therefore,
by the divine appointment, this second birth is introduced by water, which may extinguish
the nature of fire;838 and that the soul, enlightened by the heavenly Spirit, may cast away
the fear of the first birth: provided, however, it so live for the time to come, that it do not
at all seek after any of the pleasures of this world, but be, as it were, a pilgrim and a
stranger,839 and a citizen of another city.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Uses of Evils.</head>
<p>“But perhaps you will say, that in those things indeed in which the necessity of nature
demands the service of arts and works, any one may have it in his power to maintain justice,
and to put what restraint he pleases either upon his desires or his actions; but what shall we
say of the sicknesses and infirmities which befall men, and of some being harassed with
demons, and fevers, and cold fits, and some being attacked with madness, or losing their
reason, and all those things which overwhelm the race of man with innumerable misfortunes?
To this we say, that if any one consider the reason of the whole mystery, he will pronounce
these things to be more just than those that we have already explained. For God has given
a nature to men, by which they may be taught concerning what is good, and to resist evil;
that is, they may learn arts, and to resist pleasures, and to set the law of God before them in
all things. And for this end He has permitted certain contrary powers to wander up and
down in the world, and to strive against us,840 for the reasons which have been stated before,
that by striving with them the palm of victory and the merit of rewards may accrue to the
righteous.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—“Conceived in Sin.”</head>
<p>“From this, therefore, it sometimes happens, that if any persons have acted incontinently,
and have been willing not so much to resist as to yield, and to give harbour to these demons
in themselves, by their noxious breath an intemperate, ill-conditioned, and diseased progeny
is begotten. For while lust is wholly gratified, and no care is taken in the copulation, undoubtedly
a weak generation is affected with the defects and frailties of those demons by
whose instigation these things are done. And therefore parents are responsible for their
children’s defects of this sort, because they have not observed the law of intercourse. Though
there are also more secret causes, by which souls are made subject to these evils, which it is
not to our present purpose to state, yet it behoves every one to acknowledge the law of God,
that he may learn from it the observance of generation, and avoid causes of impurity, that
that which is begotten may be pure. For it is not right, while in the planting of shrubs and
the sowing of crops a suitable season is sought for, and the land is cleaned, and all things
are suitably prepared, lest haply the seed which is sown be injured and perish, that in the
case of man only, who is over all these things, there should be no attention or caution in
sowing his seed.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Tow Smeared with Pitch.</head>
<p>“But what, it is said, of the fact that some who in their childhood are free from any
bodily defect, yet in process of time fall into those evils, so that some are even violently
hurried on to death? Concerning these also the account is at hand, and is almost the same:
for those powers which we have said to be contrary to the human race, are in some way invited
into the heart of every one by many and diverse lusts, and find a way of entrance; and
they have in them such influence and power as can only encourage and incite, but cannot
compel or accomplish. If, therefore, any one consents to them, so as to do those things
which he wickedly desires, his consent and deed shall find the reward of destruction and
the worst kind of death. But if, thinking of the future judgment, he be checked by fear, and
reclaim himself, so that he do not accomplish in action what he has conceived in his evil
thought, he shall not only escape present destruction, but also future punishments. For
every cause of sin seems to be like tow smeared over with pitch, which immediately breaks
into flame as soon as it receives the heat of fire; and the kindling of this fire is understood
to be the work of demons. If, therefore, any one be found smeared with sins and lusts as
with pitch, the fire easily gets the mastery of him. But if the tow be not steeped in the pitch
of sin, but in the water of purification and regeneration, the fire of the demons shall not be
able to be kindled in it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="551"/>
<head>Chapter XI.—Fear.</head>
<p>“But some one will say, And what shall we do now, whom it has already happened to
us to be smeared with sins as with pitch? I answer: Nothing; but hasten to be washed, that
the fuel of the fire may be cleansed out of you by the invocation of the holy name, and that
for the future you may bridle your lusts by fear of the judgment to come, and with all constancy
beat back the hostile powers whenever they approach your senses. But you say, If
any one fall into love, how shall he be able to contain himself, though he see before his eyes
even that river of fire which they call Pyriphlegethon? This is the excuse of those who will
not be converted to repentance. But now I would not have you talk of Pyriphlegethon.
Place before you human punishments, and see what influence fear has. When any one is
brought to punishment for the crime of love, and is bound to the stake to be burned, can
he at that time conceive any desire of her whom he loved, or place her image before his eyes?
By no means, you will say. You see, then, that present fear cuts off unrighteous desires.
But if those who believe in God, and who confess the judgment to come, and the penalty of
eternal fire,—if they do not refrain from sin, it is certain that they do not believe with full
faith: for if faith is certain, fear also becomes certain; but if there be any detect in faith, fear
also is weakened, and then the contrary powers find opportunity of entering. And when
they have consented to their persuasions, they necessarily become subject also to their power,
and by their instigation are driven to the precipices of sin.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Astrologers.</head>
<p>“Therefore the astrologers,841 being ignorant of such mysteries, think that these things
happen by the courses of the heavenly bodies: hence also, in their answers to those who go
to them to consult them as to future things, they are deceived in very many instances. Nor
is it to be wondered at, for they are not prophets; but, by long practice, the authors of errors
find a sort of refuge in those things by which they were deceived, and introduce certain
Climacteric Periods, that they may pretend a knowledge of uncertain things. For they represent
these Climacterics as times of danger, in which one sometimes is destroyed, sometimes
is not destroyed, not knowing that it is not the course of the stars, but the operation of
demons, that regulates these things; and those demons, being anxious to confirm the error
of astrology, deceive men to sin by mathematical calculations, so that when they suffer the
punishment of sin, either by the permission of God or by legal sentence, the astrologer may
seem to have spoken truth. And yet they are deceived even in this; for if men be quickly
turned to repentance, and remember and fear the future judgment, the punishment of death
is remitted to those who are converted to God by the grace of baptism.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Retribution Here or Hereafter.</head>
<p>“But some one will say, Many have committed even murder, and adultery, and other
crimes, and have suffered no evil. This indeed rarely happens to men, but to those who
know not the counsel of God it frequently seems to happen. But God, who knows all things,
knows how and why he who sins does sin, and what cause leads each one to sin. This,
however, is in general to be noticed, that if any are evil, not so much in their mind as in
their doings, and are not borne to sin under the incitement of purpose, upon them punishment
is inflicted more speedily, and more in the present life; for everywhere and always God
renders to every one according to his deeds, as He judges to be expedient. But those who
practise wickedness of purpose, so that they sometimes even rage against those from whom
they have received benefits, and who take no thought for repentance—their punishment
He defers to the future. For these men do not, like those of whom we spoke before, deserve
to end the punishment of their crimes in the present life; but it is allowed them to occupy
the present time as they will, because their correction is not such as to need temporal chastisements,
but such as to demand the punishment of eternal fire in hell; and there their souls
shall seek repentance, where they shall not be able to find it.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Knowledge Deadens Lusts.</head>
<p>“But if, while in this life, they had placed before their eyes the punishments which they
shall then suffer, they would certainly have bridled their lusts, and would in nowise have
fallen into sin. For the understanding in the soul has much power for cutting off all its desires,
especially when it has acquired the knowledge of heavenly things, by means of which, having
received the light of truth, it will turn away from all darkness of evil actions. For as the sun
obscures and conceals all the stars by the brightness of his shining, so also the mind, by the
light of knowledge, renders all the lusts of the soul ineffective and inactive, sending out upon
them the thought of the judgment to come as its rays, so that they can no longer appear in
the soul.</p>

<pb n="555"/>
<head>Chapter XV.—Fear of Men and of God.</head>
<p>“But as a proof that the fear of God has much efficacy for the repressing of lusts, take
the example of human fear. Who is there among men that does not covet his neighbour’s
goods? And yet they are restrained, and act honestly, through fear of the punishment which
is prescribed by the laws. Through fear, nations are subject to their kings, and armies obey
with arms in their hands. Slaves, although they are stronger than their masters, yet through
fear submit to their masters’ rule. Even wild beasts are tamed by fear; the strongest bulls
submit their necks to the yoke, and huge elephants obey their masters, through fear. But
why do we use human examples, when even divine are not wanting? Does not the earth itself
remain under the fear of precept, which it testifies by its motion and quaking? The sea keeps
its prescribed bounds; the angels maintain peace; the stars keep their order, and the rivers
their channels: it is certain also that demons are put to flight by fear. And not to lengthen
the discourse by too many particulars, see how the fear of God, restraining everything, keeps
all things in proper harmony, and in their fixed order. How much more, then, may you be
sure that the lusts of demons which arise in your hearts may be extinguished and wholly
abolished by the admonition of the fear of God, when even the inciters of lust are themselves
put to flight by the influence of fear? You know that these things are so; but if you have
anything to answer, proceed.”</p>

<p>Then said the old man: “My son Clement has wisely framed his argument, so that he
has left us nothing to say to these things; but all his discourse which he has delivered on the
nature of men has this bearing, that along with the fact that freedom of will is in man, there
is also some cause of evil without him, whereby men are indeed incited by various lusts, yet
are not compelled to sin; and that for this reason, he said, because fear is much more
powerful than they, and it resists and checks the violence of desires, so that, although natural
emotions may arise, yet sin may not be committed, those demons being put to flight who
incite and inflame these emotions. But these things do not convince me; for I am conscious
of certain things from which I know well, that by the arrangement of the heavenly bodies
men become murderers or adulterers, and perpetrate other evils; and in like manner honourable
and modest women are compelled to act well.</p>

<p>“In short, when Mars, holding the centre in his house, regards Saturn quarterly, with
Mercury towards the centre, the full moon coming upon him, in the daily Genesis, he produces
murderers, and those who are to fall by the sword,843 bloody, drunken, lustful, devilish
men, inquirers into secrets,844 malefactors, sacrilegious persons, and such like; especially
when there was no one of the good stars looking on. But again Mars himself, having a
quarterly position with respect to Venus, in a direction toward the centre, while no good
star looks on, produces adulterers and incestuous persons. Venus with the Moon, in the
borders and houses of Saturn, if she was with Saturn, and Mars looking on, produces women
that are viragos, ready for agriculture, building, and every manly work, to commit adultery
with whom they please, and not to be convicted by their husbands, to use no delicacy, no
ointments, nor feminine robes and shoes, but to live after the fashion of men. But the unpropitious
Venus makes men to be as women, and not to act in any respect as men, if she
is with Mars in Aries; on the contrary, she produces women if she is in Capricorn or
Aquarius.”</p>

<p>And when the old man had pursued this subject at great length, and had enumerated

something in answer to your discourse, since indeed I am acquainted with the science of
mathematics, and gladly hold a conference with so learned a man. Listen therefore, while
I reply to what you have said that you may learn distinctly that Genesis is not at all from the

<p>“There are, in every country or kingdom, laws imposed by men, enduring either by
writing or simply through custom, which no one easily transgresses. In short, the first Seres,
who dwell at the beginning of the world,845 have a law not to know murder, nor adultery,
nor whoredom, and not to commit theft, and not to worship idols; and in all that country,
which is very large, there is neither temple, nor image, nor harlot, nor adulteress, nor is any
thief brought to trial. But neither is any man ever slain there; and no man’s liberty of will
is compelled, according to your doctrine, by the fiery star of Mars, to use the sword for the
murder of man; nor does Venus in conjunction with Mars compel to adultery, although of
course with them Mars occupies the middle circle of heaven every day. But amongst the

And these things indeed they do, though the rest of the Indians commit both murders and
adulteries, and worship idols, and are drunken, and practise other wickednesses of this sort.
Yea, in the western parts of India itself there is a certain country, where strangers, when
they enter it, are taken and slaughtered and eaten; and neither have good stars prevented
these men from such wickednesses and from accursed food, nor have malign stars compelled
the Brahmans to do any evil. Again, there is a custom among the Persians to marry mothers,

foreign countries, who are called Magusæi, of whom there are some to this day in Media,
others in Parthia, some also in Egypt, and a considerable number in Galatia and Phrygia,

decked with ornaments and precious stones; also they go abroad supported by the aid of
their maidservants, with much greater ambition than the men. They do not, however, cultivate
modesty, but have intercourse indifferently with whomsoever they please, with slaves
and guests, such liberty being allowed them by their husbands; and not only are they not
blamed for this, but they also rule over their husbands. And yet the Genesis of all the Susian
women has not Venus, with Jupiter and Mars in the middle of the heaven in the houses of
Jupiter. In the remoter parts of the East, if a boy be treated unnaturally, when it is discovered,
he is killed by his brothers, or his parents, or any of his relations, and is left unburied. And
again, among the Gauls, an old law allows boys to be thus treated publicly; and no disgrace
is thought to attach to it. And is it possible, that all those who are so basely treated among
the Gauls, have had Lucifer with Mercury in the houses of Saturn and the confines of Mars?</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Different Customs of Different Countries.</head>
<p>“In the regions of Britain several men have one wife; in Parthia many women have one
husband; and each part of the world adheres to its own manners and institutions. None of
the Amazons have husbands, but, like animals, they go out from their own territories once
a year about the vernal equinox, and live with the men of the neighbouring nation, observing
a sort of solemnity the while, and when they have conceived by them they return; and if
they bring forth a male child, they cast him away, and rear only females. Now, since the
birth of all is at one season, it is absurd to suppose that in the case of males Mars is at the
time in equal portions with Saturn, but never in the Genesis of females; and that they have
not Mercury placed with Venus in his own houses, so as to produce either painters, or
sculptors, or money-changers; or in the houses of Venus, so that perfumers, or singers, or
poets might be produced. Among the Saracens, and Upper Libyans, and Moors, and the
dwellers about the mouths of the ocean, and also in the remote districts of Germany, and
among the Sarmatians and Scythians, and all the nations who dwell in the regions of the
Pontic shore, and in the island Chrysea, there is never found a money-changer, nor a sculptor,
nor a painter, nor an architect, nor a geometrician, nor a tragedian, nor a poet. Therefore
the influence of Mercury and Venus must be wanting among them.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Not Genesis, But Free-Will.</head>
<p>“The Medes alone in all the world, with the greatest care, throw men still breathing to
be devoured by dogs; yet they have not Mars with the Moon placed in Cancer all through
their daily Genesis. The Indians burn their dead, and the wives of the dead voluntarily offer
themselves, and are burned with them. But all the Indian women who are burned alive have
not the Sun under the earth in nightly Genesis, with Mars in the regions of Mars. Very
many of the Germans end their lives by the halter; but all have not therefore the Moon with
Hora begirt by Saturn and Mars. From all this it appears that the fear of the laws bears sway
in every country, and the freedom of will which is implanted in man by the Spirit complies
with the laws; and Genesis can neither compel the Seres to commit murder, nor the Brahmans
to eat flesh, nor the Persians to shun incest, nor the Indians to refrain from burning, nor
the Medes from being devoured by dogs, nor the Parthians from having many wives, nor
the women of Mesopotamia from preserving their chastity, nor the Greeks from athletic
exercises, nor the Gallic boys from being abused; nor can it compel the barbarious nations
to be instructed in the studies of the Greeks; but, as we have said, each nation observes its
own laws according to free-will, and annuls the decrees of Genesis by the strictness of laws.</p>

<p>“But some one skilled in the science of mathematics will say that Genesis is divided into
seven parts, which they call climates, and that over each climate one of the seven heavenly
bodies bears rule; and that those diverse laws to which we have referred are not given by
men, but by those dominant stars according to their will, and that that which pleases the
star is observed by men as a law. To this we shall answer, in the first place, that the world
is not divided into seven parts; and in the second place, that if it were so, we find many different
laws in one part and one country; and therefore there are neither seven laws according
to the number of the heavenly bodies, nor twelve according to the number of the signs, nor
thirty-six according to that of the divisions of ten degrees; but they are innumerable.</p>

<p>“Moreover, we ought to remember the things which have been mentioned, that in the
one country of India there are both persons who feed on human flesh, and persons who
abstain even from the flesh of sheep, and birds, and all living creatures; and that the Magusæi
marry their mothers and daughters not only in Persia, but that in every nation where they
dwell they keep up their incestuous customs.847 Then, besides, we have mentioned also
innumerable nations, which are wholly ignorant of the studies of literature, and also some
wise men have changed the laws themselves in several places; and some laws have been
voluntarily abandoned, on account of the impossibility of observing them, or on account
of their baseness. Assuredly we can easily ascertain how many rulers have changed the laws
and customs of nations which they have conquered, and subjected them to their own laws.
This is manifestly done by the Romans, who have brought under the Roman law and the
civil decrees almost the whole world, and all nations who formerly lived under various laws
and customs of their own. It follows, therefore, that the stars of the nations which have
been conquered by the Romans have lost their climates and their portions.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Jewish Customs.</head>
<p>“I shall add another thing which may satisfy even the most incredulous. All the Jews
who live under the law of Moses circumcise their sons on the eighth day without fail, and
shed the blood of the tender infant. But no one of the Gentiles has ever submitted to this
on the eighth day; and, on the other hand, no one of the Jews has ever omitted it. How then
shall the account of Genesis stand with this, since Jews live in all parts of the world, mixed
with Gentiles, and on the eighth day suffer the cutting of a member? And no one of the
Gentiles, but only they themselves, as I have said, do this, induced to it not by the compulsion
of any star, nor by the perfusion848 of blood, but by the law of their religion; and in whatever
part of the world they are, this sign is familiar to them. But also the fact that one name is
among them all, wheresoever they are, does this also come through Genesis? And also that
no child born among them is ever exposed, and that on every seventh day they all rest,
wherever they may be, and do not go upon a journey, and do not use fire?849 Why is it,
then, that no one of the Jews is compelled by Genesis to go on a journey, or to build, or to
sell or buy anything on that day?</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—The Gospel More Powerful Than “Genesis.”</head>
<p>“But I shall give a still stronger proof of the matters in hand. For, behold, scarcely seven
years have yet passed since the advent of the righteous and true Prophet; and in the course
of these, men of all nations coming to Judæa, and moved both by the signs and miracles
which they saw, and by the grandeur of His doctrine, received His faith; and then going
back to their own countries, they rejected the lawless rites of the Gentiles, and their incestuous
marriages. In short, among the Parthians—as Thomas, who is preaching the Gospel amongst
them, has written to us—not many now are addicted to polygamy; nor among the Medes
do many throw their dead to dogs; nor are the Persians pleased with intercourse with their
mothers, or incestuous marriages with their daughters; nor do the Susian women practise
the adulteries that were allowed them; nor has Genesis been able to force those into crimes
whom the teaching of religion restrained.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—“Genesis” Inconsistent with God’s Justice.</head>
<p>“Behold, from the very matter in which we are now engaged850 draw an inference, and
from the circumstances in which we are now placed deduce a conclusion, how, through a
rumour only reaching the ears of men that a Prophet had appeared in Judæa to teach men
with signs and miracles to worship one God, all were expecting with prepared and eager
minds, even before the coming of my lord Peter, that some one would announce to them
what He taught who had appeared. But lest I should seem to carry the enumeration too far,
I shall tell you what conclusion ought to be drawn from the whole. Since God is righteous,
and since He Himself made the nature of men, how could it be that He should place Genesis
in opposition to us, which should compel us to sin, and then that He should punish us when
we do sin? Whence it is certain that God punishes no sinner either in the present life or in
that to come, except because He knows that he could have conquered, but neglected victory.
For even in the present world He takes vengeance upon men, as He did upon those who
perished in the deluge, who were all destroyed in one day, yea, in one hour, although it is
certain that they were not all born in one hour according to the order of genesis. But it is
most absurd to say that it befalls us by nature to suffer evils, if sins had not gone before.</p>

<p>“And therefore, if we desire salvation, we ought above all to seek after knowledge, being
sure that if our mind remain in ignorance, we shall endure not only the evils of genesis, but
also whatever other evils from without the demons may please, unless fear of laws and of
the judgment to come resist all our desires, and check the violence of sinning. For even
human fear does much good, and also much evil, unknown to Genesis, as we have shown
above. Therefore our mind is subject to errors in a threefold manner: from those things
which come to us through evil custom; or from those lusts which the body naturally stirs
up in us; or from those which hostile powers compel us to. But the mind has it in its own
nature to oppose and fight against these, when the knowledge of truth shines upon it, by
which knowledge is imparted fear of the judgment to come, which is a fit governor of the
mind, and which can recall it from the precipices of lusts. That these things, therefore, are
in our power, has been sufficiently stated.</p>

said the old man:851 “You have most fully argued, my son; but I, as I said at first, am prevented
by my own consciousness from according assent to all this incomparable statement
of yours. For I know both my own Genesis and that of my wife, and I know that those things
have happened which our Genesis prescribed to each of us; and I cannot now be withdrawn
by words from those things which I have ascertained by facts and deeds. In short, since I
perceive that you are excellently skilled in this sort of learning, hear the horoscope of my
wife, and you shall find the configuration whose issue has occurred. For she had Mars with
Venus above the centre, and the Moon setting in the houses of Mars and the confines of
Saturn. Now this configuration leads women to be adulteresses, and to love their own slaves,
and to end their days in foreign travel and in waters. And this has so come to pass. For she
fell in love with her slave, and fearing at once danger and reproach, she fled with him, and
going abroad, where she satisfied her love, she perished in the sea.”</p>

she was married to the slave, as indeed I had not even discovered that she loved him. But
after she was gone, my brother gave me the whole story, telling me that first she had loved
himself; but he, being honourable as a brother, would not pollute his brother’s bed with the
stain of incest. But she, being both afraid of me, and unable to bear the unhappy reproaches
(and yet she should not be blamed for that to which her Genesis compelled her), pretended
a dream, and said to me: ‘Some one stood by me in a vision, who ordered me to leave the
city without delay with my two twins.’ When I heard this, being anxious for her safety and
that of my sons, I immediately sent away her and the children, retaining with myself one
who was younger. For this she said that he had permitted who had given her warning in

said to the old man: “What was the name of your younger son?” And he said: “Clement.”
Then Peter: “If I shall this day restore to you your most chaste wife and your three sons,
will you believe that a modest mind can overcome unreasonable impulses, and that all things
that have been spoken by us are true, and that Genesis is nothing?” Then said the old man:
“As it is impossible for you to perform what you have promised, so it is impossible that
anything can take place apart from Genesis.” Then says Peter: “I wish to have all who are
here present as witnesses that I shall this day hand over to you your wife, who is living most
chastely, with your three sons. And now take a token of these things from this, that I know

Cæsar himself. His name is Faustinianus. He obtained as his wife a woman of the highest
rank, Matthidia by name. By her he had three sons, two of whom were twins; and the one
who was the younger, whose name was Clement, is this man!” When he said this, he pointed
to me with his finger. “And his twin sons are these men, Niceta and Aquila, the one of
whom was formerly called Faustinus and the other Faustus.”852 But as soon as Peter pronounced
our names, all the old man’s limbs were weakened, and he fell down in a swoon.
But we his sons rushed to him, and embraced and kissed him, fearing that we might not be
able to recall his spirit. And while these things were going on, the people were confounded

himself, laying hold of his hand, and lifting him up as from a deep sleep, and gradually reviving
him, began to set forth to him the whole transactions as they had really happened:853
how his brother had fallen in love with Matthidia, and how she, being very modest, had
been unwilling to inform her husband of his brother’s lawless love, lest she should stir up
hostility between the brothers, and bring disgrace upon the family; and how she had wisely
pretended a dream, by which she was ordered to depart from the city with her twin sons,
leaving the younger one with his father; and how on their voyage they had suffered shipwreck
through the violence of a storm; and how, when they were cast upon an island called Antaradus,
Matthidia was thrown by a wave upon a rock, but her twin children were seized by
pirates and carried to Cæsarea, and there sold to a pious woman, who treated them as sons,
and brought them up, and caused them to be educated as gentlemen; and how the pirates
had changed their names, and called the one Niceta and the other Aquila; and how afterwards,
through common studies and acquaintanceship, they had adhered to Simon; and how they
had turned away from him when they saw him to be a magician and a deceiver, and had
come to Zacchæus; and how subsequently they had been associated with himself; and how
Clement also, setting out from the city for the sake of learning the truth, had, through his
acquaintance with Barnabas, come to Cæsarea, and had become known to him, and had
adhered to him, and how he had been taught by him the faith of his religion; and also how
he had found and recognised his mother begging at Antaradus, and how the whole island
rejoiced at his recognition of her; and also concerning her sojourn with her most chaste
hostess, and the cure that he had wrought upon her, and concerning the liberality of Clement
to those who had been kind to his mother; and how afterwards, when Niceta and Aquila
asked who the strange woman was, and had heard the whole story from Clement, they cried
out that they were her twin sons Faustinus and Faustus; and how they had unfolded the
whole history of what had befallen them; and how afterwards, by the persuasion of Peter
himself, they were presented to their mother with caution, lest she should be cut off by the

and through compassion for sufferings incident to humanity,854 my mother, hearing (I
know not how) of the recognition of my father, rushed into the middle of us in breathless
haste, crying out, and saying: “Where is my husband, my lord Faustinianus, who has been
so long afflicted, wandering from city to city in search of me?” While she shouted thus like
one demented, and gazed around, the old man, running up, began to embrace and hug her
with many tears.855 And while these things were going on, Peter requested the crowds to

and so great men should stay in a hostelry, when I have almost my whole house empty, and
very many beds spread, and all necessary things provided.” But when Peter refused, the
wife of the householder prostrated herself before him with her children, and besought him,
saying, “I entreat you, stay with us.” But not even so did Peter consent, until the daughter
of those people who asked him, who had been for a long time vexed with an unclean spirit,
and bound with chains, who had been shut up in a closet, having had the demon expelled
from her, and the door of the closet opened, came with her chains and fell down at Peter’s
feet, saying: “It is right, my lord, that you keep my deliverance-feast here to-day, and not
sadden me or my parents.” But when Peter asked what was the meaning of her chains and
of her words, her parents, gladdened beyond hope by the recovery of their daughter, were,
as it were, thunderstruck with astonishment, and could not speak; but the servants who
were in attendance said: “This girl has been possessed of a demon from her seventh year,
and used to cut, and bite, and even to tear in pieces, all who attempted to approach her, and
this she has never ceased to do for twenty years till the present time. Nor could any one
cure her, or even approach her, for she rendered many helpless, and even destroyed some;
for she was stronger than any man, being doubtless strengthened by the power of the demon.
But now, as you see, the demon has fled from your presence, and the doors which were shut
with the greatest strength have been opened, and she herself stands before you in her sound
mind, asking of you to make the day of her recovery gladsome both to herself and her parents,
and to remain with them.” When one of the servants had made this statement, and the
chains of their own accord were loosened from her hands and feet, Peter, being sure that it
was by his means that soundness was restored to the girl, consented to remain with them.
And he ordered those also who had remained in the lodging, with his wife, to come over;
and every one of us having got a separate bed-chamber, we remained; and having taken
food in the usual manner, and given praises to God, we went to sleep in our several apartments.</p>

<p>But in the morning, after sunrise, I Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, along with Peter,
came to the apartment in which my father and mother were sleeping; and finding them still
asleep, we sat down before the door, when Peter addressed us in such terms as these:857
“Listen to me, most beloved fellow-servants: I know that you have a great affection for your
father; therefore I am afraid that you will urge him too soon to take upon himself the yoke
of religion, while he is not yet prepared for it; and to this he may perhaps consent, through
his affection for you. But this is not to be depended on; for what is done for the sake of men
is not worthy of approbation, and soon falls to pieces. Therefore it seems to me, that you
should permit him to live for a year according to his own judgment; and during that time
he may travel with us, and while we are instructing others he may hear with simplicity; and
as he hears, if he has any right purpose of acknowledging the truth, he will himself request
that he may take up the yoke of religion; or if he do not please to take it, he may remain a
friend. For those who do not take it up heartily, when they begin not to be able to bear it,
not only cast off that which they had taken up, but by way of excuse, as it were, for their
weakness, they begin to speak evil of the way of religion, and to malign those whom they
have not been able to follow or to imitate.”</p>

<head>Chapter II.—A Difficulty.</head>
<p>To this Niceta answered: “My lord Peter, I say nothing against your right and good
counsels; but I wish to say one thing, that thereby I may learn something that I do not know.
What if my father should die within the year during which you recommend that he should
be put off? He will go down to hell helpless, and so be tormented for ever.” Then said Peter:
“I embrace your kindly purpose towards your father, and I forgive you in respect of things
of which you are ignorant. For do you suppose that, if any one is thought to have lived
righteously, he shall forthwith be saved? Do you not think that he must be examined by
Him who knows the secrets of men, as to how he has lived righteously, whether perchance
according to the rule of the Gentiles, obeying their institutions and laws; or for the sake of
the friendship of men; or merely from custom, or any other cause; or from necessity, and
not on account of righteousness itself, and for the sake of God? For those who have lived
righteously, for the sake of God alone and His righteousness, they shall come to eternal rest,
and shall receive the perpetuity of the heavenly kingdom. For salvation is not attained by
force, but by liberty; and not through the favour of men, but by the faith of God. Then,
besides, you ought to consider that God is prescient, and knows whether this man is one of
His. But if He knows that he is not, what shall we do with respect to those things which
have been determined by Him from the beginning? But wherein I can, I give counsel: when
he is awake, and we sit down together, then do you, as if you wished to learn something,
ask a question about those matters which it is fitting for him to learn; and while we speak
to one another, he will gain instruction. But yet wait first to see if he himself ask anything;
for if he do so, the occasion of discourse will be the fitter. But if he do not ask anything, let
us by turns put questions to one another, wishing to learn something, as I have said. Such

commencement. I hope, therefore, with respect to our father also, since God by your means
has given a good beginning, that He will bestow also an ending suitable to the beginning,
and worthy of Himself. However, I make this suggestion, that if, as you have said, we begin
to speak, in presence of my father, as if for the purpose of discussing some subject, or
learning something from one another, you, my lord Peter, ought not to occupy the place of
one who has anything to learn; for if he see this, he will rather be offended. For he is convinced
that you fully know all things, as indeed you do. How then will it be, if he see you
pretending ignorance? This, as I have said, will rather hurt him, being ignorant of your
design. But if we brothers, while we converse among ourselves, are in any doubt, let a fitting
solution be given by you to our inquiry. For if he see even you hesitating and doubting,

must be sought; and when God shall give it, do you comply with my advice in what I shall
say.” While we were thus talking, a boy came to tell us that our father was now awake; and
when we were intending to go in to him, he himself came to us, and saluting us with a kiss,
after we had sat down again, he said: “Is it permitted to one to ask a question, if he wishes
it; or is silence enforced, after the manner of the Pythagoreans?” Then said Peter: “We do
not compel those who come to us either to keep silence continually, or to ask questions; but
we leave them free to do as they will knowing that he who is anxious about his salvation, if
he feels pain in any part of his soul, does not suffer it to be silent. But he who neglects his
salvation, no advantage is conferred upon him if he is compelled to ask, excepting this only,
that he may seem to be earnest and diligent. Wherefore, if you wish to get any information,
ask on.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Good and Evil.</head>
<p>Then the old man said: “There is a saying very prevalent among the Greek philosophers,
to the effect that there is in reality neither good nor evil in the life of man; but that men call
things good or evil as they appear to them, prejudiced by the use and custom of life. For
not even murder is really an evil, because it sets the soul free from the bonds of the flesh.
Further, they say that even just judges put to death those who commit crimes; but if they
knew homicide to be an evil, just men would not do that. Neither do they say that adultery
is an evil; for if the husband does not know, or does not care, there is, they say, no evil in
it. But neither, say they is theft an evil; for it takes away what one does not possess from
another who has it. And, indeed, it ought to be taken freely and openly; but in that it is
done secretly, that is rather a reproof of his inhumanity from whom it is secretly taken. For
all men ought to have the common use of all things that are in this world; but through injustice
one says that this is his, and another that that is his, and so division is caused among
men. In short, a certain man, the wisest among the Greeks,858 knowing that these things
are so, says that friends should have all things common. Now, in all things unquestionably
wives are included. He says also that, as the air and the sunshine cannot be divided, so
neither ought other things to be divided, which are given in this world to all to be possessed
in common, but should be so possessed. But I wished to say this, because I am desirous to
turn to well-doing, and I cannot act well unless I first learn what is good; and if I can understand
that, I shall thereby perceive what is evil, that is, opposite to good.
858 Allusion is made to Socrates and community of wives, as stated in the Republic of Plato.</p>

<p>“But I should like that one of you, and not Peter, should answer what I have said; for it
is not fitting to take words and instruction at his hand, with questions; but when he gives a
deliverance on any subject, that should be held without answering again. And therefore let
us keep him as an umpire; so that if at any time our discussion does not come to an issue,
he may declare what seems good to him, and so give an undoubted end to doubtful matters.
And now therefore I could believe, content with his sole opinion, if he expressed any opinion;
and this is what I shall do at last. Yet I wish first to see if it is possible by discussion to find
what is sought. My wish therefore is, that Clement should begin first, and should show if
there is any good or evil in substance or in actions.”</p>
</div>

<head>Chapter VII.—Clement’s Argument.</head>
<p>To this I answered: “Since indeed you wish to learn from me if there is any good or evil
in nature or in act, or whether it is not rather that men, prejudiced by custom, think some
things to be good, and others to be evil, forasmuch as they have made a division among
themselves of common things, which ought, as you say, to be as common as the air and the
sunshine; I think that I ought not to bring before you any statements from any other quarter
than from those studies in which you are well versed, and which you support, so that what
I say you will receive without hesitation. You assign certain boundaries of all the elements
and the heavenly bodies, and these, you say, meet in some without hurt, as in marriages;
but in others they are hurtfully united, as in adulteries. And you say that some things are
general to all, but other things do not belong to all, and are not general. But not to make a
long discussion, I shall speak briefly of the matter. The earth which is dry is in need of the
addition and admixture of water, that it may be able to produce fruits, without which man
cannot live: this is therefore a legitimate conjunction. On the contrary if the cold of hoarfrost
be mixed with the earth, or heat with the water, a conjunction of this sort produces
corruption; and this, in such things, is adultery.”</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Admitted Evils.</head>
<p>Then my father answered: “But as the harmfulness of an inharmonious conjunction of
elements or stars is immediately betrayed, so ought also adultery to be immediately shown
that it is an evil.” Then I: “First tell me this, whether, as you yourself have confessed, evils
are produced from incongruous and inharmonious mixture; and then after that we shall
inquire into the other matter.” Then my father said: “The nature of things is as you say,
my son.” Then I answered: “Since, then, you wish to learn of these things, see how many
things there are which no one doubts to be evils. Do you think that a fever, a fire, sedition,
the fall of a house, murder, holds, racks, pains, mournings, and such like, are evils?” Then
said my father: “It is true, my son, that these things are evil, and very evil; or, at all events,
whoever denies that they are evil, let him suffer them!”</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Existence of Evil on Astrological Principles.</head>
<p>Then I answered: “Since, therefore, I have to deal with one who is skilled in astrological
science,859 I shall treat the matter with you according to that science, that, taking my
method from those things with which you are familiar, you may the more readily acquiesce.
Listen now, therefore: you confess that those things which we have mentioned are evils,
such as fevers, conflagrations, and such like. Now these, according to you, are said to be
produced by malignant stars, such as the humid Saturn and the hot Mars; but things contrary
to these are produced by benignant stars, such as the temperate Jupiter and the humid
Venus. Is it not so?” My father answered: “It is so, my son; and it cannot be otherwise.”
Then said I: “Since you say, therefore, that good things are produced by good stars—by
Jupiter and Venus, for example—let us see what is the product where any one of the evil
stars is mixed with the good, and let us understand that that is evil. For you lay it down that
Venus makes marriages, and if she have Jupiter in her configuration she makes the marriages
chaste; but if Jupiter be not regarding, and Mars be present, then you pronounce that the
marriages are corrupted by adultery.” Then said my father: “It is even so.” Then I answered:
“Therefore adultery is an evil, seeing that it is committed through the admixture of evil stars;
and, to state it in a word, all things that you say that the good stars suffer from the mixture
of evil stars, are undoubtedly to be pronounced to be evil. Those stars, therefore, by whose
admixture we have said that fevers, configurations, and other such like evils are produced,—
those, according to you, work also murders, adulteries, thefts, and also produce
haughty and stolid men.”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—How to Make Progress.</head>
<p>Then my father said: “Truly you have shown briefly and incomparably that there are
evils in actions; but still I should wish to learn this, how God justly judges those who sin, as
you say, if Genesis compels them to sin?” Then I answered: “I am afraid to speak anything
to you, my father, because it becomes me to hold you in all honour, else I have an answer
to give you, if it were becoming.” Then says my father: “Speak what occurs to you, my son;
for it is not you, but the method of inquiry, that does the wrong, as a modest woman to an
incontinent man, if she is indignant for her safety and her honour.” Then I answered: “If
we do not hold by the principles that we have acknowledged and confessed, but if those
things which have been defined are always loosened by forgetfulness, we shall seem to be
weaving Penelope’s web, undoing what we have done. And therefore we ought either not
to acquiesce too easily, before we have diligently examined the doctrine propounded; or if
we have once acquiesced, and the proposition has been agreed to, then we ought to keep by
what has been once determined, that we may go on with our inquiries respecting other
matters.” And my father said: “You say well, my son; and I know why you say this: it is
because in the discussion yesterday on natural causes, you showed that some malignant
power, transferring itself into the order of the stars, excites the lusts of men, provoking them
in various ways to sin, yet not compelling or producing sins.” To this I answered: “It is well
that you remember it; and yet, though you do remember it, you have fallen into error.”
Then said my father: “Pardon me, my son; for I have not yet much practice in these things:
for indeed your discourses yesterday, by their truth, shut me up to agree with you; yet in
my consciousness there are, as it were, some remains of fevers, which for a little hold me
back from faith, as from health. For I am distracted, because I know that many things, yea,
almost all things, have befallen me according to Genesis.”</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Test of Astrology.</head>
<p>Then I answered: “I shall therefore tell you, my father, what is the nature of mathematics,
and do you act according to what I tell you. Go to a mathematician,860 and tell him first
that such and such evils have befallen you at such a time, and that you wish to learn of him
whence, or how, or through what stars they have befallen you. He will no doubt answer
you that a malignant Mars or Saturn has ruled your times, or that some one of them has
been periodic; or that some one has regarded you diametrically, or in conjunction, or centrally;
or some such answer will he give, adding that in all these some one was not in harmony
with the malignant one, or was invisible, or was in the figure, or was beyond the division,
or was eclipsed, or was not in contact, or was among the dark stars; and many other like
things will he answer, according to his own reasons, and will condescend upon particulars.
After him go to another mathematician, and tell him the opposite, that such and such good
happened to you at that time, mentioning to him the same time, and ask him from what
parts of your Genesis this good has come to you, and take care, as I said, that the times are
the same with those about which you asked concerning evils. And when you have deceived
him concerning the times, see what figures he will invent for you, by which to show that
good things ought to have befallen you at those very times. For it is impossible for those
treating of the Genesis of men not to find in every quarter, as they call it, of the heavenly
bodies, some stars favourably placed, and some unfavourably; for the circle is equally complete
in every part, according to mathematics, admitting of diverse and various causes, from
which they can take occasion of saying whatever they please.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Astrology Baffled by Free-Will.</head>
<p>“For, as usually happens when men see unfavourable dreams, and can make nothing
certain out of them, when any event occurs, then they adapt what they saw in the dream to
what has occurred; so also is mathematics. For before anything happens, nothing is declared
with certainty; but after something has happened, they gather the causes of the event. And
thus often, when they have been at fault, and the thing has fallen out otherwise, they take
the blame to themselves, saying that it was such and such a star which opposed, and that
they did not see it; not knowing that their error does not proceed from their unskilfulness
in their art, but from the inconsistency of the whole system. For they do not know what
those things are which we indeed desire to do, but in regard to which we do not indulge our
desires. But we who have learned the reason of this mystery know the cause, since, having
freedom of will, we sometimes oppose our desires, and sometimes yield to them.861 And
therefore the issue of human doings is uncertain, because it depends upon freedom of will.
For a mathematician can indeed indicate the desire which a malignant power produces; but
whether the acting or the issue of this desire shall be fulfilled or not, no one can know before
the accomplishment of the thing, because it depends upon freedom of will. And this is why
ignorant astrologers have invented to themselves the talk about climacterics as their refuge
in uncertainties, as we showed fully yesterday.</p>

<p>“If you have anything that you wish to say to this, say on.” Then my father: “Nothing
can be more true, my son, than what you have stated.” And while we were thus speaking
among ourselves, some one informed us that a great multitude of people were standing
outside, having assembled for the purpose of hearing. Then Peter ordered them to be admitted,
for the place was large and convenient. And when they had come in, Peter said to
us: “If any one of you wishes, let him address the people, and discourse concerning idolatry.”
To whom I Clement answered: “Your great benignity and gentleness and patience towards
all encourages us, so that we dare speak in your presence, and ask what we please; and
therefore, as I said, the gentleness of your disposition invites and encourages all to undertake
the precepts of saving doctrine. This I never saw before in any one else, but in you only,

<head>Chapter XIV.—No Man Has Universal Knowledge.</head>
<p>Then Peter said: “These things come not only from envy or indignation; but sometimes
there is a bashfulness in some persons, lest haply they may not be able to answer fully the
questions that may be proposed, and so they avoid the discovery of their want of skill. But
no one ought to be ashamed of this, because there is no man who ought to profess that he
knows all things; for there is only One who knows all things, even He who also made all
things. For if our Master declared that He knew not the day and the hour whose signs even
He foretold, and referred the whole to the Father, how shall we account it disgraceful to
confess that we are ignorant of some things, since in this we have the example of our Master?
But this only we profess, that we know those things which we have learned from the true
Prophet; and that those things have been delivered to us by the true Prophet, which He
judged to be sufficient for human knowledge.”</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—Clement’s Disclosure.</head>
<p>Then I Clement went on to speak thus: “At Tripolis, when you were disputing against
the Gentiles, my lord Peter, I greatly wondered at you, that although you were instructed
by your father according to the fashion of the Hebrews and in observances of your own law,
and were never polluted by the studies of Greek learning, you argued so magnificently and
so incomparably; and that you even touched upon some things concerning the histories of
the gods, which are usually declaimed in the theatres. But as I perceived that their fables
and blasphemies are not so well known to you, I shall discourse upon these in your hearing,
repeating them from the very beginning, if it please you.” Then says Peter: “Say on; you
do well to assist my preaching.” Then said I: “I shall speak, therefore, because you order
me, not by way of teaching you, but of making public what foolish opinions the Gentiles
entertain of the gods.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—“Would that All God’s People Were Prophets.”</head>
<p>But when I was about to speak, Niceta, biting his lip, beckoned to me to be silent. And
when Peter saw him, he said: “Why would you repress his liberal disposition and noble
nature, that you would have him be silent for my honour, which is nothing? Or do you not
know, that if all nations, after they have heard from me the preaching of the truth, and have
believed, would betake themselves to teaching, they would gain the greater glory for me, if
indeed you think me desirous of glory? For what so glorious as to prepare disciples for
Christ, not who shall be silent, and shall be saved alone, but who shall speak what they have
learned, and shall do good to others? I wish indeed that both you, Niceta, and you, beloved
Aquila, would aid me in preaching the word of God, and the rather because those things in
which the Gentiles err are well known to you; and not you only, but all who hear me, I wish,
as I have said, so to hear and to learn, that they may be able also to teach: for the world
needs many helpers, by whom men may be recalled from error.” When he had spoken thus,

<head>Chapter XVII.—Gentile Cosmogony.</head>
<p>And I immediately rejoined: “Seeing that when you were disputing at Tripolis, as I said,
you discoursed much concerning the gods of the Gentiles profitably and convincingly, I
desire to set forth in your presence the ridiculous legends concerning their origin, both that
you may not be unacquainted with the falsehood of this vain superstition, and that the
hearers who are present may know the disgraceful character of their error. The wise men,
then, who are among the Gentiles, say that first of all things was chaos;862 that this, through
a long time solidifying its outer parts, made bounds to itself and a sort of foundation, being
gathered, as it were, into the manner and form of a huge egg, within which, in the course
of a long time, as within the shell of the egg, there was cherished and vivified a certain animal;
and that afterwards, that huge globe being broken, there came forth a certain kind of man
of double sex, which they call masculo-feminine. This they called Phanetas, from appearing,
because when it appeared, they say, then also light shone forth. And from this, they say that
there were produced substance, prudence, motion, and coition, and from these the heavens
and the earth were made. From the heaven they say that six males were produced, whom
they call Titans; and in like manner, from the earth six females, whom they called Titanides.
And these are the names of the males who sprang from the heaven: Oceanus, Coeus, Crios,
Hyperion, Iapetus, Chronos, who amongst us is called Saturn. In like manner, the names
of the females who sprang from the earth are these: Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne,
Tethys, Hebe.863</p>

the second, and in like manner all the rest. The first male, therefore, who had married the
first female, was on her account drawn downwards; but the second female rose upwards,
by reason of him to whom she was married; and so each doing in their order, remained in
those places which fell to their share by the nuptial lot. From their intercourse they assert
that innumerable others sprang. But of these six males, the one who is called Saturn received
in marriage Rhea, and having been warned by a certain oracle that he who should be born
of her should be more powerful than himself, and should drive him from his kingdom, he
determined to devour all the sons that should be born to him. First, then, there is born to
him a son called Aides, who amongst us is called Orcus; and him, for the reason we have
just stated, he took and devoured. After him he begot a second son, called Neptune; and
him he devoured in like manner. Last of all, he begot him whom they call Jupiter; but him
his mother Rhea pitying, by stratagem withdrew from his father when he was about to devour
him. And first, indeed, that the crying of the child might not be noticed, she made certain
Corybantes strike cymbals and drums, that by the deafening sound the crying of the infant
might not be heard.</p>

<p>“But when he understood from the lessening of her belly that her child was born, he
demanded it, that he might devour it; then Rhea presented him with a large stone, and told
him that that was what she had brought forth. And he took it, and swallowed it; and the
stone, when it was devoured, pushed and drove forth those sons whom he had formerly
swallowed. Therefore Orcus, coming forth first, descended, and occupies the lower, that
is, the infernal regions. The second, being above him—he whom they call Neptune—is
thrust forth upon the waters. The third, who survived by the artifice of his mother Rhea,

<p>“But enough of the old wife’s fables and genealogy of the Gentiles; for it were endless if
I should set forth all the generations of those whom they call gods, and their wicked doings.
But by way of example, omitting the rest, I shall detail the wicked deeds of him only whom
they hold to be the greatest and the chief, and whom they call Jupiter.864 For they say that
he possesses heaven, as being superior to the rest; and he, as soon as he grew up, married
his own sister, whom they call Juno, in which truly he at once becomes like a beast. Juno
bears Vulcan; but, as they relate, Jupiter was not his father. However, by Jupiter himself
she became mother of Medea; and Jupiter having received a response that one who should
be born of her should be more powerful than himself, and should expel him from his kingdom,
took her and devoured her. Again Jupiter produced Minerva from his brain, and
Bacchus from his thigh. After this, when he had fallen in love with Thetis, they say that
Prometheus informed him that, if he lay with her, he who should be born of her should be
more powerful than his father; and for fear of this, he gave her in marriage to one Peleus.
Subsequently he had intercourse with Persephone, who was his own daughter by Ceres and
by her he begot Dionysius,865 who was torn in pieces by the Titans. But calling to mind, it
is said, that perhaps his own father Saturn might beget another son, who might be more
powerful than himself, and might expel him from the kingdom, he went to war with his
father, along with his brothers the Titans; and having beaten them, he at last threw his
father into prison, and cut off his genitals, and threw them into the sea. But the blood which
flowed from the wound, being mixed with the waves, and turned into foam by the constant
churning, produced her whom they call Aphrodite, and whom with us they call Venus.
From his intercourse with her who was thus his own sister, they say that this same Jupiter
begot Cypris, who, they say, was the mother of Cupid.</p>

her sister Eurynome, and punished their father; and he committed adultery with Plute, the
daughter of his own son Atlas, and condemned Tantalus, whom she bore to him. Of Larisse,
the daughter of Orchomenus, he begot Tityon, whom also he consigned to punishment.
He carried off Dia, the wife of his own son Ixion, and subjected him to perpetual punishment;
and almost all the sons who sprang from his adulteries he put to violent deaths; and indeed
the sepulchres of almost all of them are well known. Yea, the sepulchre of this parricide
himself, who destroyed his uncles and defiled their wives, who committed whoredom with
his sisters, this magician of many transformations, is shown among the Cretans, who, although
they know and acknowledge his horrid and incestuous deeds, and tell them to all,
yet are not ashamed to confess him to be a god. Whence it seems to me to be wonderful,
yea, exceeding wonderful, how he who exceeds all men in wickedness and crimes, has received
that holy and good name which is above every name, being called the father of gods and
men; unless perhaps he who rejoices in the evils of men has persuaded unhappy souls to
confer honour above all others upon him whom he saw to excel all others in crimes, in order
that he might allure all to the imitation of his evil deeds.</p>

at hand and still recent, since we have shown that they worship those whom they themselves
confess to have been men, and to have died, or rather to have been punished; as the Syrians
worship Adonis, and the Egyptians Osiris; the Trojans, Hector; Achilles is worshipped at
Leuconesus, Patroclus at Pontus, Alexander the Macedonian at Rhodes; and many others
are worshipped, one in one place and another in another, whom they do not doubt to have

conferred divine honour upon dead men, who perhaps had had some power or some skill,

words, I could even enumerate almost all the stars, and trees, and fountains, and rivers,
which they assert to have been made of men; yet, by way of example, I shall mention at least
one of each class. They say that Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, was turned into a
star; Daphne, the daughter of the river Lado, into a tree; Hyacinthus, beloved of Apollo,
into a flower; Callisto into the constellation which they call Arctos; Progne and Philomela,
with Tereus, into birds; that Thysbe in Cilicia was dissolved into a fountain; and Pyramus,
at the same place, into a river. And they assert that almost all the stars, trees, fountains, and

<p>But Peter, when he heard this, said: “According to them, then, before men were changed
into stars, and the other things which you mention, the heaven was without stars, and the
earth without trees and animals; and there were neither fountains, nor rivers, nor birds.
And without these, how did those men themselves live, who afterwards were changed into
them, since it is evident that, without these things, men could not live upon the earth?”
Then I answered: “But they are not even able to observe the worship of their own gods
consistently; for every one of those whom they worship has something dedicated to himself,
from which his worshippers ought to abstain: as they say the olive is dedicated to Minerva,
the she-goat to Jupiter, seeds to Ceres, wine to Bacchus, water to Osiris, the ram to Hammon,
the stag to Diana, the fish and the dove to the demon of the Syrians, fire to Vulcan; and to
each one, as I have said, is there something specially consecrated, from which the worshippers
are bound to abstain, for the honour of those to whom they are consecrated. But were one
abstaining from one thing, and another from another, by doing honor to one of the gods,
they incur the anger of all the rest; and therefore, if they would conciliate them all, they must
abstain from all things for the honour of all, so that, being self-condemned by a just sentence
before the day of judgment, they should perish by a most wretched death through starvation.</p>

only know to be impious, wicked, profane—I mean Jupiter—incestuous, a parricide, an
adulterer, but even proclaim him publicly as such in their songs in the theatres? Or if by
means of these deeds he has deserved to be a god, then also, when they hear of any murderers,
adulterers, parricides, incestuous persons, they ought to worship them also as gods. But I
cannot understand why they venerate in him what they execrate in others.” Then Peter
answered: “Since you say that you cannot understand it, learn of me why they venerate
wickedness in him. In the first place, it is that, when they themselves do like deeds, they
may know that they shall be acceptable to him, inasmuch as they have but imitated him in
his wickedness. In the second place, because the ancients have left these things skilfully
composed in their writings, and elegantly engrafted in their verses. And now, by the aid of
youthful education, since the knowledge of these things adheres to their tender and simple

<head>Chapter XXX.—Cosmogony of Orpheus.</head>
<p>“All the literature among the Greeks which is written on the subject of the origin of
antiquity, is based upon many authorities, but especially two, Orpheus and Hesiod.868 Now
their writings are divided into two parts, in respect of their meaning,—that is the literal and
the allegorical; and the vulgar crowd has flocked to the literal, but all the eloquence of the
philosophers and learned men is expended in admiration of the allegorical. It is Orpheus,
then, who says that at first there was chaos, eternal, unbounded, unproduced, and that from
it all things were made. He says that this chaos was neither darkness nor light, neither moist
nor dry, neither hot nor cold, but that it was all things mixed together, and was always one
unformed mass; yet that at length, as it were after the manner of a huge egg, it brought forth
and produced from itself a certain double form, which had been wrought through immense
periods of time, and which they call masculo-feminine, a form concrete from the contrary
admixture of such diversity; and that this is the principle of all things, which came of pure
matter, and which, coming forth, effected a separation of the four elements, and made
heaven of the two elements which are first, fire and air, and earth of the others, earth and
water; and of these he says that all things now are born and produced by a mutual participation
of them. So far Orpheus.</p>

from which he says that those eleven were produced (and sometimes also he speaks
of them as twelve) of whom he makes six males and five females. And these are the names
that he gives to the males: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Chronos, who is also
called Saturn. Also the names of the females are: Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne,
Tethys.869 And these names they thus interpret allegorically. They say that the number is
eleven or twelve: that the first is nature itself, which also they would have to be called Rhea,
from Flowing; and they say that the other ten are her accidents, which also they call qualities;
yet they add a twelfth, namely Chronos, who with us is called Saturn, and him they take to
be time.870 Therefore they assert that Saturn and Rhea are time and matter; and these, when
they are mixed with moisture and dryness, heat and cold, produce all things.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Allegorical Interpretation.</head>
<p>“She therefore (Rhea, or nature), it is said, produced, as it were, a certain bubble which
had been collecting for a long time; and it being gradually collected from the spirit which
was in the waters, swelled, and being for some time driven over the surface of matter, from
which it had come forth as from a womb, and being hardened by the rigour of cold, and
always increasing by additions of ice, at length was broken off and sunk into the deep, and
drawn by its own weight, went down to the infernal regions; and because it became invisible
it was called Aides, and is also named Orcus or Pluto.871 And since it was sunk from the
top to the bottom, it gave place to the moist element to flow together; and the grosser part,
which is the earth, was laid bare by the retirement of the waters. They say, therefore, that
this freedom of the waters, which was formerly restrained by the presence of the bubble,
was called Neptune after the bubble attained the lowest place. After this, when the cold
element had been sucked down to the lower regions by the concretion of the icy bubble,
and the dry and the moist element had been separated, there being now no hindrance, the
warm element rushed by its force and lightness to the upper regions of the air, being borne
up by wind and storm. This storm, therefore, which in Greek is called καταιγίς, they called
ægis—that is, a she-goat; and the fire which ascended to the upper regions they called Jupiter;
wherefore they say that he ascended to Olympus riding on a she-goat.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Allegory of Jupiter, Etc.</head>
<p>“Now this Jupiter the Greeks would have to be called from his living, or giving life, but
our people from his giving succour.872 They say, therefore, that this is the living substance,
which, placed in the upper regions, and drawing all things to itself by the influence of heat,
as by the convolution of the brain, and arranging them by the moderation of a certain
tempering, is said from his head to have produced wisdom, whom they call Minerva, who
was called ᾽Αθήνη by the Greeks on account of her immortality; who, because the father of
all created all things by his wisdom, is also said to have been produced from his head, and
from the principal place of all, and is represented as having formed and adorned the whole
world by the regulated admixture of the elements.873 Therefore the forms which were impressed
upon matter, that the world might be made, because they are constrained by the
force of heat, are said to be held together by the energy of Jupiter. And since there are
enough of these, and they do not need anything new to be added to them, but each thing is
repaired by the produce of its own seed, the hands of Saturn are said to be bound by Jupiter;
because, as I have said, time now produces from matter nothing new: but the warmth of
seeds restores all things according to their kinds; and no birth of Rhea—that is, no increase
of flowing matter—ascends further. And therefore they call that first division of the elements
the mutilation of Saturn, because he cannot any more produce a world.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Other Allegories.</head>
<p>“And of Venus they give forth an allegory to this effect. When, say they, the sea was
put under the air, and when the brightness of the heavens shone more pleasantly, being reflected
from the waters, the loveliness of things, which appeared fairer from the waters, was
called Venus; and she, it, being united with the air as with her, its, own brother, so as to
produce beauty, which might be the object of desire, is said to have given birth to Cupid.
In this way, therefore, as we have said, they teach that Chronos, who is Saturn, is allegorically
time; Rhea is matter; Aides—that is, Orcus—is the depth of the infernal regions; Neptune
is water; Jupiter is air—that is, the element of heat; Venus is the loveliness of things; Cupid
is desire, which is in all things, and by which posterity is propagated, or even the reason of
things, which gives delight when wisely looked into. Hera—that is, Juno—is said to be that
middle air which descends from heaven to earth. To Diana, whom they call Proserpine,
they hand over the air below. They say that Apollo is the Sun himself, which goes round
the heaven; that Mercury is speech, by which a reason is rendered for everything; that Mars
is unrestrained fire, which consumes all things. But not to delay you by enumerating
everything, those who have the more abstruse intelligence concerning such things think
that they give fair and just reasons, by applying this sort of allegory to every one of their

<p>When Niceta had thus spoken, Aquila answered:874 “Whoever he was that was the author
and inventor of these things, he seems to me to have been very impious, since he covered
over those things which seem to be pleasant and seemly, and made the ritual of his superstition
to consist in base and shameful observances, since those things which are written according
to the letter are manifestly unseemly and base; and the whole observance of their
religion consists in these, that by such crimes and impieties they may teach men to imitate
their gods whom they worship. For in these allegories what profit can there be to them?
For although they are framed so as to be decent, yet no use is derived from them for worship,
nor for amendment of morals.</p>

<p>“Whence it is the more evident that prudent men, when they saw that the common superstition
was so disgraceful, so base, and yet they had not learned any way of correcting it,
or any knowledge, endeavoured with what arguments and interpretations they could to veil
unseemly things under seemly speech, and not, as they say, to conceal seemly reasons under
unseemly fables. For if this were the case, surely their statues and their pictures would
never be made with representations of their vices and crimes. The swan, which committed
adultery with Leda, would not be represented, nor the bull which committed adultery with
Europa; nor would they turn into a thousand monstrous shapes, him whom they think
better than all. And assuredly, if the great and wise men who are amongst them knew that
all this is fiction and not truth, would not they charge with impiety and sacrilege those who
should exhibit a picture or carve an image of this sort, to the injury of the gods? In short,
let them present a king of their own time in the form of an ox, or a goose, or an ant, or a
vulture, and let them write the name of their king upon it, and set up such a statue or figure
in a public place, and they will soon be made to feel the wrong of their deed, and the greatness

of Saturn devouring his sons, and of the boy hidden by the cymbals and drums of the
Corybantes; and with respect to the mutilation of Saturn, what better proof of its truth could
there be, than that even his worshippers are mutilated, by a like miserable fate, in honour
of their god? Since then these things are manifestly seen, who shall be found of so little

thrown into the fire, that they may not persuade the still tender age of boys that Jupiter

<p>Then he answered: “Be sure, beloved Aquila, that all things are done by the good
providence of God, that the cause which was to be contrary to the truth should not only be
infirm and weak, but also base. For if the assertion of error had been stronger and more
truth-like, any one who had been deceived by it would not easily return to the path of truth.
If even now, when so many wicked and disgraceful things are related concerning the gods
of the Gentiles, scarce any one forsakes the base error, how much more if there had been in
it anything seemly and truth-like? For the mind is with difficulty transferred from those
things with which it has been imbued in early youth; and on this account, as I said, it has
been effected by divine providence, that the substance of error should be both weak and
base. But all other things also divine providence dispenses fitly and advantageously, although
the method of the divine dispensation, as good, and the best possible, is not clear to us who

<p>When Peter had thus said, I Clement asked Niceta that he would explain to us, for the

not be unacquainted with these things.” Then said Niceta: “If my lord Peter permits me, I
can do as you ask me.” Then said Peter: “To-day I have given you leave to speak in opposition
to the Gentiles, as you know.” And Niceta said: “Tell me then, Clement, what you
would have me speak about.” And I said to him: “Inform us how the Gentiles represent
matters concerning the supper of the gods, which they had at the marriage of Peleus and
Thetis.875 What do they make of the shepherd Paris, and what of less Juno, Minerva, and
Venus, between whom he acted as judge? What of Mercury? and what of the apple, and the
other things which follow in order?”</p>

<pb n="619"/>
<head>Chapter XLI.—Explanation of Mythology.</head>
<p>Then Niceta: “The affair of the supper of the gods stands in this wise. They say that
the banquet is the world, that the order of the gods sitting at table is the position of the
heavenly bodies. Those whom Hesiod calls the first children of heaven and earth, of whom
six were males and six females, they refer to the number of the twelve signs, which go round
all the world. They say that the dishes of the banquet are the reasons and causes of things,
sweet and desirable, which in the shape of inferences from the positions of the signs and
the courses of the stars, explain how the world is ruled and governed. Yet they say these
things exist after the free manner of a banquet, inasmuch as the mind of every one has the
option whether he shall taste aught of this sort of knowledge, or whether he shall refrain;
and as in a banquet no one is compelled, but every one is at liberty to eat, so also the manner
of philosophizing depends upon the choice of the will. They say that discord is the lust of
the flesh, which rises up against the purpose of the mind, and hinders the desire of philosophizing;
and therefore they say that the time was that in which the marriage was celebrated.
Thus they make Peleus and the nymph Thetis to be the dry and the moist element, by the
admixture of which the substance of bodies is composed. They hold that Mercury is speech,
by which instruction is conveyed to the mind; that Juno is chastity, Minerva courage, Venus
lust, Paris the understanding. If therefore, say they, it happens that there is in a man a barbarous
and uncultivated understanding, and ignorant of right judgment, he will despise
chastity and courage, and will give the prize, which is the apple, to lust; and thereby, ruin
and destruction will come not only upon himself, but also upon his countrymen and the
whole race. These things, therefore, it is in their power to compose from whatever matter
they please; yet they can be adapted to every man; because if any one has a pastoral and
rustic and uncultivated understanding, and does not wish to be instructed, when the heat
of his body shall make suggestions concerning the pleasure of lust, straightway he despises
the virtues of studies and the blessings of knowledge, and turns his mind to bodily pleasures.
And hence it is that implacable wars arise, cities are destroyed, countries fall, even as Paris,
by the abduction of Helen, armed the Greeks and the barbarians to their mutual destruction.”</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Interpretation of Scripture.</head>
<p>Then Peter, commending his statement, said:876 “Ingenious men, as I perceive, take
many verisimilitudes from the things which they read; and therefore great care is to be taken,
that when the law of God is read, it be not read according to the understanding of our own
mind. For there are many sayings in the divine Scriptures which can be drawn to that sense
which every one has preconceived for himself; and this ought not to be done. For you ought
not to seek a foreign and extraneous sense, which you have brought from without, which
you may confirm from the authority of the Scriptures, but to take the sense of truth from
the Scriptures themselves; and therefore it behoves you to learn the meaning of the Scriptures
from him who keeps it according to the truth handed down to him from his fathers, so that
he can authoritatively declare what he has rightly received. But when one has received an
entire and firm rule of truth from the Scriptures, it will not be improper if he contribute to
the establishment of true doctrine anything from common education and from liberal
studies, which, it may be, he has attached himself to in his boyhood; yet so that, when he
has learned the truth, he renounce falsehood and pretence.”</p>

<p>And when he had said this, he looked to our father, and said: “You therefore, old man,
if indeed you care for your soul’s safety, that when you desire to be separated from the body,
it may, in consequence of this short conversion, find eternal rest, ask about whatever you
please, and seek counsel, that you may be able to cast off any doubt that remains in you.
For even to young men the time of life is uncertain; but to old men it is not even uncertain,
for there is no doubt that there is but little time remaining to them. And therefore both
young and old ought to be very earnest about their conversion and repentance, and to be
taken up with the adornment of their souls for the future with the worthiest ornaments,
such as the doctrines of truth, the grace of chastity, the splendour of righteousness, the
fairness of piety, and all other things with which it becomes a reasonable mind to be adorned.
Then, besides, they should break off from unseemly and unbelieving companions, and keep
company with the faithful, and frequent those assemblies in which subjects are handled relating
to chastity, righteousness and piety; to pray to God always heartily, and to ask of Him
those things which ought to be asked of God; to give thanks to Him; to repent truly of their
past doings; in some measure also, if possible, by deeds of mercy towards the poor, to help
their penitence: for by these means pardon will be more easily bestowed, and mercy will

thanks to God, because, having received the knowledge of the truth, after all the violence of
carnal lust has been broken, there awaits him no fight of contest, by which to repress the
pleasures of the body rising against the mind. It remains, therefore, that he be exercised in
the learning of the truth, and in works of mercy, that he may bring forth fruits worthy of
repentance; and that he do not suppose that the proof of conversion is shown by length of
time, but by strength of devotion and of purpose. For minds are manifest to God; and He
does not take account of times, but of hearts. For He approves if any one, on hearing the
preaching of the truth, does not delay, nor spend time in negligence, but immediately, and
if I may say so, in the same moment, abhorring the past, begins to desire things to come,

<p>“Wherefore, let no one of you longer dissemble nor look backwards, but willingly approach
to the Gospel of the kingdom of God. Let not the poor man say, When I shall become
rich, then I shall be converted. God does not ask money of you, but a merciful heart and a
pious mind. Nor let the rich man delay his conversion by reason of worldly care, while he
thinks how he may dispose the abundance of his fruits; nor say within himself, ‘What shall
I do? where shall I bestow my fruits?’ Nor say to his soul, ‘Thou hast much goods laid up
for many years; feast and rejoice.’ For it shall be said to him, ‘Thou fool, this night thy soul
shall be taken from thee, and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?’877
Therefore let every age, every sex, every condition, haste to repentance, that they may obtain
eternal life. Let the young be thankful that they put their necks under the yoke of discipline
in the very violence of their desires. The old also are themselves praise-worthy, because
they change for the fear of God, the custom of a long time in which they have been unhappily
occupied.</p>

<p>“Let no one therefore put off. Let no one delay. For what occasion is there for delaying
to do well? Or are you afraid, lest, when you have done well, you do not find the reward as
you supposed? And what loss will you sustain if you do well without reward? Would not
conscience alone be sufficient in this? But if you find as you anticipate, shall you not receive
great things for small, and eternal for temporal? But I say this for the sake of the unbelieving.
For the things which we preach are as we preach them; because they cannot be otherwise,
since they have been promised by the prophetic word.</p>

and let him ascertain what the true Prophet is; and then at length all doubtfulness will cease
to him, unless with obstinate mind he resist those things which he finds to be true. For
there are some whose only object it is to gain the victory in any way whatever, and who seek
praise for this rather than their salvation. These ought not to have a single word addressed
to them, lest both the noble word suffer injury, and condemn to eternal death him who is
guilty of the wrong done to it. For what is there in respect of which any one ought to oppose
our preaching? or in respect of which the word of our preaching is found to be contrary to
the belief of what is true and honourable? It says that the God the Father, the Creator of
all, is to be honoured, as also His Son, who alone knows Him and His will, and who alone
is to be believed concerning all things which He has enjoined. For He alone is the law and
the Lawgiver, and the righteous Judge, whose law decrees that God, the Lord of all, is to be
honoured by a sober, chaste, just, and merciful life, and that all hope is to be placed in Him
alone.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVIII.—Errors of the Philosophers.</head>
<p>“But some one will say that precepts of this sort are given by the philosophers also.878
Nothing of the kind: for they do indeed give commandments concerning justice and
sobriety, but they are ignorant that God is the recompenser of good and evil deeds; and
therefore their laws and precepts only shun a public accuser, but cannot purify the conscience.
For why should one fear to sin in secret, who does not know that there is a witness
and a judge of secret things? Besides, the philosophers in their precepts add that even the
gods, who are demons, are to be honoured; and this alone, even if in other respects they
seemed worthy of approbation, is sufficient to convict them of the most dreadful impiety,
and condemn them by their own sentence, since they declare indeed that there is one God,
yet command that many be worshipped, by way of humouring human error. But also the
philosophers say that God is not angry, not knowing what they say. For anger is evil, when
it disturbs the mind, so that it loses right counsel. But that anger which punishes the wicked
does not bring disturbance to the mind; but it is one and the same affection, so to speak,
which assigned rewards to the good and punishment to the evil; for if He should bestow
blessings upon the good and the evil, and confer equal rewards upon the pious and the impious,
He would appear to be unjust rather than good.</p>

<p>“But you say, Neither ought God to do evil. You say truly; nor does He. But those who
have been created by Him, while they do not believe that they are to be judged, indulging
their pleasures, have fallen away from piety and righteousness. But you will say, If it is right
to punish the wicked, they ought to be punished immediately when they do wickedly. You
indeed do well to make haste; but He who is eternal, and from whom nothing is secret,
inasmuch as He is without end, in the same proportion is His patience extended, and He
regards not the swiftness of vengeance, but the causes of salvation. For He is not so much
pleased with the death as with the conversion of a sinner.879 Therefore, in short, He has
bestowed upon men holy baptism, to which, if any one makes haste to come, and for the
future remains without stain, all his sins are thenceforth blotted out, which were committed
in the time of his ignorance.</p>

<head>Chapter L.—Philosophers Not Benefactors of Men.</head>
<p>“For what have the philosophers contributed to the life of man, by saying that God is
not angry with men? Only to teach them to have no fear of any punishment or judgment,
and thereby to take away all restraint from sinners. Or what have they benefited the human
race, who have said that there is no God, but that all things happen by chance and accident?
What but that men, hearing this, and thinking that there is no judge, no guardian of things,
are driven headlong, without fear of any one, to every deed which either rage, or avarice, or
lust may dictate. For they truly have much benefited the life of man who have said that
nothing can be done apart from Genesis; that is, that every one, ascribing the cause of his
sin to Genesis, might in the midst of his crimes declare himself innocent, while he does not
wash out his guilt by repentance, but doubles it by laying the blame upon fate. And what
shall I say of those philosophers who have maintained that the gods are to be worshipped,
and such gods as were described to you a little while ago? What else was this but to decree
that vices, crimes, and base deeds should be worshipped? I am ashamed of you, and I pity
you, if you have not yet discovered that these things were unworthy of belief, and impious,
and execrable, or if, having discovered and ascertained them to be evil, ye have nevertheless
worshipped them as if they were good, yea, even the best.</p>

<p>“Then, besides, of what sort is that which some of the philosophers have presumed to
speak even concerning God, though they are mortal, and can only speak by opinion concerning
invisible things, or concerning the origin of the world, since they were not present
when it was made, or concerning the end of it, or concerning the treatment and judgment
of souls in the infernal regions, forgetting that it belongs indeed to a reasonable man to
know things present and visible, but that it is the part of prophetic prescience alone to know
things past, and things future, and things invisible? These things, therefore, are not to be
gathered from conjectures and opinions, in which men are greatly deceived, but from faith
in prophetic truth, as this doctrine of ours is. For we speak nothing of ourselves, nor announce
things gathered by human judgment; for this were to deceive our hearers. But we
preach the things which have been committed and revealed to us by the true Prophet. And
concerning His prophetic prescience and power, if any one, as I have said, wishes to receive
clear proofs, let him come instantly and be alert to hear, and we shall give evident proofs
by which he shall seem not only to hear the power of prophetic prescience with his ears, but
even to see it with his eyes and handle it with his hand; and when he has entertained a sure
faith concerning Him, he will without any labour take upon him the yoke of righteousness
and piety;880 and so great sweetness will he perceive in it, that not only will he not find fault
with any labour being in it, but will even desire something further to be added and imposed
upon him.”</p>

<p>And when he had said this, and more to the same purpose, and had cured some who
were present who were infirm and possessed of demons, he dismissed the crowds, while
they gave thanks and praised God, charging them to come to the same place on the following
days also for the sake of hearing. And when we were together at home, and were preparing
to eat, one entering told us that Appion Pleistonices,881 with Anubion, were lately come
from Antioch, and were lodging with Simon.882 Then my father, when he heard this, rejoiced,
and said to Peter: “If you permit me, I should like to go and salute Appion and Anubion,
for they are great friends of mine; and perhaps I shall be able to persuade Anubion to dispute
with Clement on the subject of Genesis.” Then Peter said: “I consent; and I commend you,
because you respect your friends. But consider how all things occur to you according to
your wish by God’s providence; for, behold, not only have the objects of proper affection
been restored to you by the appointment of God, but also the presence of your friends is
arranged for you.” Then said my father: “Truly I consider that it is so as you say.” And
when he had said this, he went away to Anubion.</p>
<note type="footnote">881 The name is generally written Apion. The meaning of Pleistonices is doubtful, some supposing that it
indicates his birthplace, some his father; but generally it is taken as an epithet, and it will then refer to his frequent

<p>But we, sitting with Peter the whole night, asking questions, and learning of him on
many subjects, remained awake through very delight in his teaching and the sweetness of
his words; and when it was daybreak, Peter, looking at me and my brothers, said: “I wonder
what has befallen your father.” And while he was speaking my father came in, and found
Peter speaking to us about him. And when he had saluted he began to apologize, and to
explain the reason why he had remained abroad. But we, looking at him, were horrified;
for we saw on him the face of Simon, yet we heard the voice of our father. And when we
shrank from him, and cursed him, my father was astonished at our treating him so harshly
and barbarously. Yet Peter was the only one who saw his natural countenance; and he said
to us: “Why do you curse your father?” And we, along with our mother, answered him:
“He appears to us to be Simon, though he has our father’s voice.” Then Peter: “You indeed
know only his voice, which has not been changed by the sorceries; but to me also his face,
which to others appears changed by Simon’s art, is known to be that of your father
Faustinianus.” And looking at my father, he said: “The cause of the dismay of your wife
and your sons is this,—the appearance of your countenance does not seem to be as it was,
but the face of the detestable Simon appears in you.”</p>

<p>And while he was thus speaking, one of those returned who had gone before to Antioch,
and said to Peter: “I wish you to know, my lord Peter, that Simon at Antioch, doing many
signs and prodigies in public, has inculcated upon the people nothing but what tends to
excite hatred against you, calling you a magician, a sorcerer, a murderer; and to such an
extent has he stirred up hatred against you, that they greatly desire, if they can find you
anywhere, even to devour your flesh. And therefore we who were sent before, seeing the
city greatly moved against you, met together in secret, and considered what ought to be
done.</p>

<head>Chapter LV.—A Stratagem.</head>
<p>“And when we saw no way of getting out of the difficulty, there came Cornelius the
centurion, being sent by Cæsar to the president of Cæsarea on public business. Him we
sent for alone, and told him the reason why we were sorrowful, and entreated him that, if
he could do anything, he should help us. Then he most readily promised that he would
straightway put him to flight, if only we would aid his plans. And when we promised that
we would be active in doing everything, he said, ‘Cæsar has ordered sorcerers to be sought
out and destroyed in the city of Rome and through the provinces, and a great number of
them have been already destroyed. I shall therefore give out, through my friends, that I am
come to apprehend that magician, and that I am sent by Cæsar for this purpose, that he
may be punished with the rest of his fraternity. Let your people, therefore, who are with
him in disguise, intimate to him, as if they had heard it from some quarter, that I am sent
to apprehend him; and when he hears this, he is sure to take to flight. Or if you think of
anything better, tell me. Why need I say more?’ It was so done by those of ours who were
with him, disguised for the purpose of acting as spies on him. And when Simon learned
that this was come upon him, he received the information as a great kindness conferred
upon him by them, and took to flight. He therefore departed from Antioch, and, as we have
heard, came hither with Athenodorus.</p>

<p>“All we, therefore, who went before you, considered that in the meantime you should
not go up to Antioch, till we see if the hatred of you which he has sown among the people
be in any degree lessened by his departure.” When he who had come from Antioch had
imparted this information, Peter, looking to our father, said, “Faustinianus, your countenance
has been transformed by Simon Magus, as is evident; for he, thinking that he was being
sought for by Cæsar for punishment, has fled in terror, and has placed his own countenance
upon you, if haply you might be apprehended instead of him, and put to death, that so he
might cause sorrow to your sons.” But my father, when he heard this, crying out, said with
tears: “You have judged rightly, O Peter: for Anubion also, who is very friendly with me,
began to inform me in a certain mysterious way of his plots; but unhappily I did not believe
him, because I had done him no harm.”</p>

<p>And when all of us, along with my father, were agitated with sorrow and weeping,

making for Judæa. But seeing our father lamenting and bewailing himself, and saying,
“Wretch that I am, not to believe when I heard that he is a magician! What has befallen
wretched me, that on one day, being recognised by my wife and my sons, I have not been
able to rejoice with them, but have been rolled back to the former miseries which I endured
in my wandering!”—but my mother, tearing her dishevelled hair, bewailed much more
bitterly,—we also, confounded at the change of our father’s countenance, were, as it were,
thunderstruck and beside ourselves, and could not understand what was the matter. But
Anubion, seeing us all thus afflicted, stood like one dumb. Then Peter, looking at us his
sons, said: “Believe me that this is your very father; wherefore also I charge you that you
respect him as your father. For God will afford some opportunity on which he shall be able
to put off the countenance of Simon, and to recover the manifest figure of your father—that
is, his own.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to my father, he said: “I gave you leave to salute Appion and Anubion,
who, you said, were your friends from boyhood, but not that you should speak with Simon.”
Then my father said: “I confess I have sinned.” Then said Anubion: “I also with him beg
and entreat of you to pardon the old man—good and noble man as he is. He was unhappily
seduced and imposed upon by the magician in question; for I will tell you how the thing
was done. When he came to salute us, it happened that at that very time we were standing
around him, hearing him tell that he intended to flee away that night, for that he had heard
that some persons had come even to this city of Laodicea to apprehend him by command
of the emperor, but that he wished to turn all their rage against this Faustinianus, who has
lately come hither. And he said to us: ‘Only you make him sup with us, and I shall compound
a certain ointment, with which, when he has supped, he shall anoint his face, and from that
time he shall seem to all to have my countenance. But you first anoint your faces with the
juice of a certain herb, that you may not be deceived as to the change of his countenance,
so that to all except you he shall seem to be Simon.’</p>

<head>Chapter LIX.—A Scene of Mourning.</head>
<p>“And when he said this, I said to him, ‘And what advantage will you gain from this
deed?’ Then Simon said: ‘In the first place, that those who are seeking me may lay hold on
him, and so give over the search for me. But if he be punished by Cæsar, that his sons may
have much sorrow, who forsook me, and fled to Peter, and are now his assistants.’ Now I
confess to you, Peter, what is true. I did not dare then tell Faustinianus; but neither did Simon
give us opportunity of speaking with him in private, and disclosing to him fully Simon’s
design. Meantime, about the middle of the night, Simon has fled away, making for Judæa.
And Athenodorus and Appion have gone to convoy him; but I pretended bodily indisposition,
that I might remain at home, and make him return quickly to you, if haply he may in any
way be concealed with you, lest, being seized by those who are in quest of Simon, he be
brought before Cæsar, and perish without cause. And now, in my anxiety about him, I have
come to see him, and to return before those who have gone to convoy Simon come back.”
And turning to us, Anubion said: “I, Anubion, indeed see the true countenance of your
father, because I was previously anointed by Simon himself, as I have told you, that the real
face of Faustinianus might appear to my eyes; whence I am astonished and wonder at the
art of Simon Magus, because you standing here do not recognise your father.” And while
my father and mother, and all of us, wept for the things which had befallen, Anubion, moved
with compassion, also wept.</p>

<p>Then Peter, moved with compassion, promised that he would restore the face of our

countenance shall have conferred some advantage on us, and shall have subserved the designs
which we have in view, then I shall restore to you the true form of your countenance; on
condition, however, that you first despatch what I shall command you.” And when my
father promised that he would with all his might fulfil everything that he might charge him
with, provided only that he might recover his own countenance, Peter thus began: “You
have heard with your own ears, that one of those who had been sent before has returned
from Antioch, and told us how Simon, while he was there, stirred up the multitudes against
me, and inflamed the whole city into hatred of me, declaring that I am a magician, and a
murderer, and a deceiver, so that they are eager, if they see me, even to eat my flesh. Do
therefore what I tell you: leave Clement with me, and go before us to Antioch, with your
wife, and your sons Faustus and Faustinus. And I shall also send others with you, whom I
think fit, who shall observe whatsoever I command them.</p>

stand in a public place, and proclaim your repentance, and say: ‘I Simon declare to you,
and confess that all that I said concerning Peter was false: for he is neither a seducer, nor a
magician, nor a murderer, nor any of the things that I spoke against him; but I said all these
things under the instigation of madness. I therefore entreat you, even I myself, who erewhile
gave you causes of hatred against him, that you think no such thing concerning him. But
lay aside your hatred; cease from your indignation; because he is truly sent by God for the
salvation of the world—a disciple and apostle of the true Prophet. Wherefore I advise, exhort,
and charge you that you hear him, and believe him when he preaches to you the truth, lest
haply, if you despise him, your very city suddenly perish. But I will tell you why I now make
this confession to you. This night an angel of God rebuked me for my wickedness, and
scourged me terribly, because I was an enemy to the herald of the truth. Therefore I entreat
you, that even if I myself should ever again come to you, and attempt to say anything against
Peter, you will not receive nor believe me. For I confess to you, I was a magician, a seducer,
a deceiver; but I repent, for it is possible by repentance to blot out former evil deeds.’”</p>

<p>When Peter made this intimation to my father, he answered: “I know what you wish;
do not trouble yourself further: for I understand and know what I am to undertake when
I come to the place.” And Peter gave him further instruction, saying: “When therefore you
come to the place, and see the people turned by your discourse, and laying aside their hatred,
and returning to their longing for me, send and tell me, and I shall come immediately; and
when I come, I shall without delay set you free from this strange countenance, and restore
to you your own, which is known to all your friends.” And having said this, he ordered my
brothers to go with him, and at the same time our mother Matthidia, and some of our
friends. But my mother refused to go along with him, and said: “It seems as if I should be
an adulteress if I were to associate with the countenance of Simon; but if I be compelled to
go along with him, it is at all events impossible that I can lie in the same bed with him; but
I do not know if I can consent even to go with him.” And when she stoutly refused, Anubion
began to exhort her, saying: “Believe me and Peter. But does not even his voice persuade
you that he is your husband Faustinianus, whom truly I love not less than you do? And, in
short, I also myself shall come with you.” And when Anubion had said this, my mother

those whom Peter had ordered to accompany him, and with Anubion; in the morning, before
Peter went to the discussion, those men returned who had convoyed Simon, namely Appion
and Athenodorus, and came to us inquiring after my father. But Peter, when he was informed
of their coming, ordered them to enter. And when they were seated, they asked, “Where is
Faustinianus?” Peter answered: “We do not know; for since the evening that he went to
you, no one of his friends has seen him. But yesterday morning Simon came inquiring for
him; and because we gave him no answer, I know not what he meant, but he said that he
was Faustinianus. But when nobody believed him, he went and lamented, and threatened
that he would destroy himself; and afterwards he went away towards the sea.”</p>

saying: “Why have you done this? Why did you not receive him?” And when Athenodorus
was going to tell me that it was my father Faustinianus himself, Appion prevented him, and
said: “We have learned from some one that he has gone with Simon, and that at the entreaty
of Faustinianus himself, being unwilling to see his sons, because they are Jews. When
therefore we heard this, we came to inquire after him here; but since he is not here, it appears
that he must have spoken truly who told us that he has gone with Simon. This, therefore,
we tell you.” But I Clement, when I understood the designs of Peter, that he wished to make
them suppose that the old man would be required at their hands, so that they might be afraid
and flee away, I began to aid his design, and said to Appion: “Listen, dear Appion: what
we believe to be good, we wish to deliver to our father also; but if he will not receive it, but
rather, as you say, flees away through abhorrence of us—it may perhaps be harsh to say
so—we care nothing about him.” And when I had said this, they departed, cursing my
cruelty, and followed the track of Simon, as we learned on the following day.</p>

but has been sent by God for the salvation of you all; and if from this hour you think that
he is to be despised, be assured that your very city may suddenly be destroyed. But, you will
ask, what is the reason that I make this confession to you of my own accord? I was vehemently
rebuked by an angel of God this night, and most severely scourged, because I was
his enemy. I therefore entreat you, that if from this hour even I myself shall ever open my
mouth against him, you will drive me from your sight; for that foul demon, who is an enemy
to the salvation of men, speaks against him through my mouth, that you may not attain to
life by his means. For what miracle could the magic art show you through me? I made
brazen dogs bark, and statues move, men change their appearances, and suddenly vanish
from men’s sight; and for these things you ought to have cursed the magic art, which bound
your souls with devilish fetters, that I might show you a vain miracle, that you might not
believe Peter, who cures the sick in the name of Him by whom he is sent, and expels demons,
and gives sight to the blind, and restores health to the palsied, and raises the dead.”</p>

<p>Whilst he made these and similar statements, the people began to curse him, and to
weep and lament because they had sinned against Peter, believing him to be a magician or
wicked man. But the same day, at evening, Faustinianus had his own face restored to him,
and the appearance of Simon Magus left him. Now Simon, hearing that his face on
Faustinianus had contributed to the glory of Peter, came in haste to anticipate Peter, and
intending to cause by his art that his likeness should be taken from Faustinianus, when
Christ had already accomplished this according to the word of His apostle. But Niceta and
Aquila, seeing their father’s face restored after the necessary proclamation, gave thanks to
God, and would not suffer him to address the people any more.</p>

<p>But Simon began, though secretly, to go amongst his friends and acquaintances, and to
malign Peter more than before. Then all spat in his face, and drove him from the city, saying:
“You will be chargeable with your own death, if you think of coming hither again, speaking
against Peter.” These things being known at Laodicea, Peter ordered the people to meet on
the following day; and having ordained one of those who followed him as bishop over them,
and others as presbyters, and having baptized multitudes, and restored to health all who
were troubled with sicknesses or demons, he stayed there three days longer; and all things
being properly arranged, he bade them farewell, and set out from Laodicea, being much
longed for by the people of Antioch.884 And the whole city began to hear, through Niceta
and Aquila, that Peter was coming. Then all the people of the city of Antioch, hearing of
Peter’s arrival, went to meet him, and almost all the old men and the nobles came with ashes
sprinkled on their heads, in this way testifying their repentance, because they had listened
to the magician Simon, in opposition to his preaching.</p>

<p>Stating these and such like things, they bring to him those distressed with sicknesses,

was an infinite number of sick people collected. And when Peter saw that they not only
repented of the evil thoughts they had entertained of him through means of Simon, but also
that they showed so entire faith in God, that they believed that all who suffered from every
sort of ailment could be healed by him, he spread out his hands towards heaven, pouring
out prayers with tears, and gave thanks to God, saying: “I bless thee, O Father, worthy of
all praise, who hast deigned to fulfil every word and promise of Thy Son, that every creature
may know that Thou alone art God in heaven and in earth.”</p>

through Him who, coming down from heaven, has shown to those who believe in Him a
perfect medicine for body and soul. Hence let all this people be witnesses to your declaration,
that with your whole heart you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they may know that
themselves also may be saved by Him.” And when all the multitude of the sick with one
voice cried out that He is the true God whom Peter preaches, suddenly an overpowering
light of the grace of God appeared in the midst of the people; and the paralytics being cured,
began to run to Peter’s feet, the blind to shout on the recovery of their sight, the lame to
give thanks on regaining the power of walking, the sick to rejoice in restored health; some
even who were barely alive, being already without consciousness or the power of speech,

<p>Then I Clement, with my brothers and our mother, spoke to our father, asking him
whether any remnants of unbelief remained in him. And he said: “Come, and you shall
see, in the presence of Peter, what an increase of faith has grown in me.” Then Faustinianus
approached, and fell down at Peter’s feet, saying: “The seeds of your word, which the field
of my mind has received, are now sprung up, and have so advanced to fruitful maturity,
that nothing is wanting but that you separate me from the chaff by that spiritual reapinghook
of yours, and place me in the garner of the Lord, making me partaker of the divine
table.” Then Peter, with all alacrity grasping his hand, presented him to me Clement, and
my brothers, saying: “As God has restored your sons to you, their father, so also your sons
restore their father to God.” And he proclaimed a fast to all the people, and on the next
Lord’s day he baptized him; and in the midst of the people, taking occasion from his conversion,
he related all his fortunes, so that the whole city received him as an angel, and paid
him no less honour than they did to the apostle.886 And these things being known, Peter
ordered the people to meet on the following day; and having ordained one of his followers as
bishop, and others as presbyters, he baptized also a great number of people, and restored to
health all who had been distressed with sicknesses.887</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
The Clementine Homilies.</head>
<p>[By the Rev. Thomas Smith, D.D.]</p>
<p>We have already given an account of the Clementines in the Introductory Notice to the
Recognitions.888 All that remains for us to do here, is to notice the principal editions of the
Homilies. The first edition was published by Cotelerius in his collection of the Apostolic
Fathers, from a manuscript in the Royal Library at Paris, the only manuscript of the work
then known to exist. He derived assistance from an epitome of the work which he found
in the same library. The text of Cotelerius was revised by Clericus in his edition of Cotelerius,
but more carefully by Schwegler, Stuttgart, 1847. The Paris ms. breaks off in the middle of
the fourteenth chapter of the nineteenth book.</p>
<p>In 1853 (Göttingen) Dressel published a new recension of the Homilies, having found
a complete manuscript of the twenty Homilies in the Ottobonian Library in Rome. In 1859
(Leipzig) he published an edition of two Epitomes of the Homilies,—the one previously
edited by Turnebus and Cotelerius being given more fully, and the other appearing for the
first time. To these Epitomes were appended notes by Frederic Wieseler on the Homilies.
The last edition of the Clementines is by Paul de Lagarde (Leipzig, 1865), which has no new
sources, is pretentious, but far from accurate.</p>
<note type="footnote">888 [The reader is referred to the Introductory Notice prefixed to this edition of the Clementine literature
for a brief summary of the views respecting the relations of the two principal works. The footnotes throughout
will aid in making a comparison. The preparation of these notes has strengthened the conviction of the writer
that the Recognitions are not dependent on the Homilies, but that the reverse may be true.—R.]</note>

<head>Chapter I.—Doctrine of Reserve.</head>
<p>Knowing, my brother, your eager desire after that which is for the advantage of us all,
I beg and beseech you not to communicate to any one of the Gentiles the books of my
preachings which I sent to you, nor to any one of our own tribe before trial; but if any one
has been proved and found worthy, then to commit them to him, after the manner in which
Moses delivered his books to the Seventy who succeeded to his chair. Wherefore also the
fruit of that caution appears even till now. For his countrymen keep the same rule of monarchy
and polity everywhere, being unable in any way to think otherwise, or to be led out
of the way of the much-indicating Scriptures. For, according to the rule delivered to them,
they endeavour to correct the discordances of the Scriptures, if any one, haply not knowing
the traditions, is confounded at the various utterances of the prophets. Wherefore they
charge no one to teach, unless he has first learned how the Scriptures must be used. And
thus they have amongst them one God, one law, one hope.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Misrepresentation of Peter’s Doctrine.</head>
<p>In order, therefore, that the like may also happen to those among us as to these Seventy,
give the books of my preachings to our brethren, with the like mystery of initiation, that
they may indoctrinate those who wish to take part in teaching; for if it be not so done, our
word of truth will be rent into many opinions. And this I know, not as being a prophet, but
as already seeing the beginning of this very evil. For some from among the Gentiles have
rejected my legal preaching, attaching themselves to certain lawless and trifling preaching
of the man who is my enemy.890 And these things some have attempted while I am still
alive, to transform my words by certain various interpretations, in order to the dissolution
of the law; as though I also myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which
God forbid! For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of God which was spoken
by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its eternal continuance; for
thus he spoke: “The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in
no wise pass from the law.”891 And this He has said, that all things might come to pass.
But these men, professing, I know not how, to know my mind, undertake to explain my
words, which they have heard of me, more intelligently than I who spoke them, telling their
catechumens that this is my meaning, which indeed I never thought of. But if, while I am
still alive, they dare thus to misrepresent me, how much more will those who shall come
after me dare to do so!</p>

<p>Therefore, that no such thing may happen, for this end I have prayed and besought you
not to communicate the books of my preaching which I have sent you to any one, whether
of our own nation or of another nation, before trial; but if any one, having been tested, has
been found worthy, then to hand them over to him, according to the initiation of Moses,
by which he delivered his books to the Seventy who succeeded to his chair; in order that thus
they may keep the faith, and everywhere deliver the rule of truth, explaining all things after
our tradition; lest being themselves dragged down by ignorance, being drawn into error by
conjectures after their mind, they bring others into the like pit of destruction. Now the
things that seemed good to me, I have fairly pointed out to you; and what seems good to
you, do you, my lord, becomingly perform. Farewell.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="655"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—An Adjuration Concerning the Receivers of the Book.</head>
<p>1. Therefore James, having read the epistle, sent for the elders; and having read it to
them, said: “Our Peter has strictly and becomingly charged us concerning the establishing
of the truth, that we should not communicate the books of his preachings, which have been
sent to us, to any one at random, but to one who is good and religious, and who wishes to
teach, and who is circumcised, and faithful. And these are not all to be committed to him
at once; that, if he be found injudicious in the first, the others may not be entrusted to him.
Wherefore let him be proved not less than six years. And then according to the initiation
of Moses, he that is to deliver the books should bring him to a river or a fountain, which is
living water, where the regeneration of the righteous takes place, and should make him, not
swear—for that is not lawful—but to stand by the water and adjure, as we ourselves, when
we were re-generated,892 were made to do for the sake of not sinning.</p>
<p>2. “And let him say: ‘I take to witness heaven, earth, water, in which all things are
comprehended, and in addition to all these, that air also which pervades all things, and
without which I cannot breathe, that I shall always be obedient to him who gives me the
books of the preachings; and those same books which he may give me, I shall not communicate
to any one in any way, either by writing them, or giving them in writing, or giving
them to a writer, either myself or by another, or through any other initiation, or trick, or
method, or by keeping them carelessly, or placing them before any one, or granting him
permission to see them, or in any way or manner whatsoever communicating them to another;
unless I shall ascertain one to be worthy, as I myself have been judged, or even more
so, and that after a probation of not less than six years; but to one who is religious and good,
chosen to teach, as I have received them, so I will commit them, doing these things also according
to the will of my bishop.</p>
<p>3. “‘But otherwise, though he were my son or my brother, or my friend, or otherwise
in any way pertaining to me by kindred, if he be unworthy, that I will not vouchsafe the favour
to him, as is not meet; and I shall neither be terrified by plot nor mollified by gifts. But if
even it should ever seem to me that the books of the preachings given to me are not true, I
shall not so communicate them, but shall give them back. And when I go abroad, I shall
carry them with me, whatever of them I happen to possess. But if I be not minded to carry
them about with me, I shall not suffer them to be in my house, but shall deposit them with
my bishop, having the same faith, and setting out from the same persons as myself.893 But
if it befall me to be sick, and in expectation of death, and if I be childless, I shall act in the
same manner. But if I die having a son who is not worthy, or not yet capable, I shall act in

<note type="footnote">893 Unless the reading be corrupt here, I suppose the reference must be to episcopal succession.</note>

<pb n="656"/>
the same manner. For I shall deposit them with my bishop, in order that if my son, when
he grows up, be worthy of the trust, he may give them to him as his father’s bequest, according
to the terms of this engagement.</p>
<p>4. “‘And that I shall thus do, I again call to witness heaven, earth, water, in which all
things are enveloped, and in addition to all these, the all-pervading air, without which I
cannot breathe, that I shall always be obedient to him who giveth me these books of the
preachings, and shall observe in all things as I have engaged, or even something more. To
me, therefore, keeping this covenant, there shall be a part with the holy ones; but to me doing
anything contrary to what I have covenanted, may the universe be hostile to me, and the
all-pervading ether, and the God who is over all, to whom none is superior, than whom
none is greater. But if even I should come to the acknowledgment of another God, I now
swear by him also, be he or be he not, that I shall not do otherwise. And in addition to all
these things, if I shall lie, I shall be accursed living and dying, and shall be punished with
everlasting punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Adjuration Accepted.</head>
<p>James having thus spoken, the elders were in an agony of terror. Therefore James,
perceiving that they were greatly afraid, said: “Hear me, brethren and fellow-servants. If
we should give the books to all indiscriminately, and they should be corrupted by any daring
men, or be perverted by interpretations, as you have heard that some have already done, it
will remain even for those who really seek the truth, always to wander in error. Wherefore
it is better that they should be with us, and that we should communicate them with all the
fore-mentioned care to those who wish to live piously, and to save others. But if any one,
after taking this adjuration, shall act otherwise, he shall with good reason incur eternal
punishment. For why should not he who is the cause of the destruction of others not be
destroyed himself?” The elders, therefore, being pleased with the sentiments of James exclaimed,
“Blessed be He who, as foreseeing all things, has graciously appointed thee as our
bishop;” and when they had said this, we all rose up, and prayed to the Father and God of
all, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.894</p>

<p>Be it known to you, my lord, that Simon, who, for the sake of the true faith, and the
most sure foundation of his doctrine, was set apart to be the foundation of the Church, and
for this end was by Jesus Himself, with His truthful mouth, named Peter, the first-fruits of
our Lord, the first of the apostles; to whom first the Father revealed the Son; whom the
Christ, with good reason, blessed; the called, and elect, and associate at table and in the
journeyings of Christ; the excellent and approved disciple, who, as being fittest of all, was
commanded to enlighten the darker part of the world, namely the West, and was enabled
to accomplish it,—and to what extent do I lengthen my discourse, not wishing to indicate
what is sad, which yet of necessity, though reluctantly, I must tell you,—he himself, by
reason of his immense love towards men, having come as far as Rome, clearly and publicly
testifying, in opposition to the wicked one who withstood him, that there is to be a good
King over all the world, while saving men by his God-inspired doctrine, himself, by violence,
exchanged this present existence for life.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Ordination of Clement.</head>
<p>But about that time, when he was about to die, the brethren being assembled together,
he suddenly seized my hand, and rose up, and said in presence of the church: “Hear me,
brethren and fellow-servants. Since, as I have been taught by the Lord and Teacher Jesus
Christ, whose apostle I am, the day of my death is approaching, I lay hands upon this
Clement as your bishop; and to him I entrust my chair of discourse, even to him who has
journeyed with me from the beginning to the end, and thus has heard all my homilies—who,
in a word, having had a share in all my trials, has been found stedfast in the faith; whom I
have found, above all others, pious, philanthropic, pure, learned, chaste, good, upright,
large-hearted, and striving generously to bear the ingratitude of some of the catechumens.
Wherefore I communicate to him the power of binding and loosing, so that with respect to
everything which he shall ordain in the earth, it shall be decreed in the heavens. For he shall
bind what ought to be bound, and loose what ought to be loosed, as knowing the role of the
Church. Therefore hear him, as knowing that he who grieves the president of the truth,
sins against Christ, and offends the Father of all. Wherefore he shall not live; and therefore
it becomes him who presides to hold the place of a physician, and not to cherish the rage
of an irrational beast.”</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Nolo Episcopari.</head>
<p>While he thus spoke, I knelt to him, and entreated him, declining the honour and the
authority of the chair. But he answered: “Concerning this matter do not ask me; for it has
seemed to me to be good that thus it be, and all the more if you decline it. For this chair
has not need of a presumptuous man, ambitious of occupying it, but of one pious in conduct
and deeply skilled in the word of God. But show me a better than yourself, who has travelled
more with me, and has heard more of my discourses, and has learned better the regulations
of the Church, and I shall not force you to do well against your will. But it will not be in
your power to show me your superior; for you are the choice first-fruits of the multitudes
saved through me. However, consider this further, that if you do not undertake the administration
of the Church, through fear of the danger of sin, you may be sure that you sin more,
when you have it in your power to help the godly, who are, as it were, at sea and in danger,
and will not do so, providing only for your own interest, and not for the common advantage
of all. But that it behoves you altogether to undertake the danger, while I do not cease to

<head>Chapter IV.—The Recompense of the Reward.</head>
<p>“But I myself also, O Clement, know the griefs and anxieties, and dangers and reproaches,
that are appointed you from the uninstructed multitudes; and these you will be able to bear
nobly, looking to the great reward of patience bestowed on you by God. But also consider
this fairly with me: When has Christ need of your aid? Now, when the wicked one has
sworn war against His bride; or in the time to come, when He shall reign victorious, having
no need of further help? Is it not evident to any one who has even the least understanding,
that it is now? Therefore with all good-will hasten in the time of the present necessity to
do battle on the side of this good King, whose character it is to give great rewards after victory.
Therefore take the oversight gladly; and all the more in good time, because you have
learned from me the administration of the Church, for the safety of the brethren who have
taken refuge with us.</p>

<p>“However, I wish, in the presence of all, to remind you, for the sake of all, of the things
belonging to the administration. It becomes you, living without reproach, with the greatest
earnestness to shake off all the cares of life, being neither a surety, nor an advocate, nor involved
in any other secular business. For Christ does not wish to appoint you either a judge
or an arbitrator in business, or negotiator of the secular affairs of the present life, lest, being
confined to the present cares of men, you should not have leisure by the word of truth to
separate the good among men from the bad. But let the disciples perform these offices to
one another, and not withdraw you from the discourses which are able to save. For as it is
wicked for you to undertake secular cares, and to omit the doing of what you have been
commanded to do, so it is sin for every layman, if they do not stand by one another even in
secular necessities. And if all do not understand to take order that you be without care in
respect of the things in which you ought to be, let them learn it from the deacons; that you

your hearers. For not being able, on account of occupation, to point out the things that are
advantageous, both you should be punished, as not having taught what was profitable, and
they, not having learned, should perish by reason of ignorance. Wherefore do you indeed
preside over them without occupation, so as to send forth seasonably the words that are
able to save them; and so let them listen to you, knowing that whatever the ambassador of
the truth shall bind upon earth is bound also in heaven, and what he shall loose is loosed.
But you shall bind what ought to be bound, and loose what ought to be loosed. And these,

<head>Chapter VII.—Duties of Presbyters.</head>
<p>“And with respect to the presbyters, take these instructions. Above all things, let them
join the young betimes in marriage, anticipating the entanglements of youthful lusts. But
neither let them neglect the marriage of those who are already old; for lust is vigorous even
in some old men. Lest, therefore, fornication find a place among you, and bring upon you
a very pestilence, take precaution, and search, lest at any time the fire of adultery be secretly
kindled among you. For adultery is a very terrible thing, even such that it holds the second
place in respect of punishment, the first being assigned to those who are in error, even although
they be chaste. Wherefore do you, as elders of the Church, exercise the spouse of
Christ to chastity (by the spouse I mean the body of the Church); for if she be apprehended
to be chaste by her royal Bridegroom, she shall obtain the greatest honour; and you, as
wedding guests, shall receive great commendation. But if she be caught having sinned, she
herself indeed shall be cast out; and you shall suffer punishment, if at any time her sin has
been through your negligence.</p>

<p>“Wherefore above all things be careful about chastity; for fornication has been marked
out as a bitter thing in the estimation of God. But there are many forms of fornication, as
also Clement himself will explain to you. The first is adultery, that a man should not enjoy
his own wife alone, or a woman not enjoy her own husband alone. If any one be chaste, he
is able also to be philanthropic, on account of which he shall obtain eternal mercy. For as
adultery is a great evil, so philanthropy is the greatest good. Wherefore love all your brethren
with grave and compassionate eyes, performing to orphans the part of parents, to widows
that of husbands, affording them sustenance with all kindliness, arranging marriages for
those who are in their prime, and for those who are without a profession, the means of necessary
support through employment; giving work to the artificer, and alms to the incapable.</p>

there is one only fit means, viz., the common partaking of food.896 Wherefore see
to it that ye be frequently one another’s guests, as ye are able, that you may not fail of it.
For it is the cause of well-doing, and well-doing of salvation. Therefore all of you present
your provisions in common to all your brethren in God, knowing that, giving temporal
things, you shall receive eternal things. Much more feed the hungry, and give drink to the
thirsty, and clothing to the naked; visit the sick; showing yourselves to those who are in
prison, help them as ye are able, and receive strangers into your houses with all alacrity.
However, not to speak in detail, philanthropy will teach you to do everything that is good,

to them. Moreover, also, flee avarice, inasmuch as it is able, under pretext of temporal gain,
to deprive you of eternal blessings. Carefully keep your balances, your measures, your
weights, and the things belonging to your traffic, just. Be faithful with respect to your trusts.
Moreover, you will persevere in doing these things, and things similar to these, until the
end, if you have in your hearts an ineradicable remembrance of the judgment that is from
God. For who would sin, being persuaded that at the end of life there is a judgment appointed
of the righteous God, who only now is long-suffering and good,897 that the good may in
future enjoy for ever unspeakable blessings; but the sinners being found as evil, shall obtain
an eternity of unspeakable punishment. And, indeed, that these things are so, it would be

being enemies to those to whom he is an enemy, and not conversing with those with whom
he does not converse, in order that every one, desiring to have you all as his friends, may
be reconciled to him and be saved, listening to his discourse. But if any one remain a friend

I must, you send to James the brother of the Lord a brief account of your reasonings from
your boyhood, and how from the beginning until now you have journeyed with me, hearing

will not fail to inform him of the manner of my death, as I said before. For that event will
not grieve him very much, when he knows that I piously went through what it behoved me
to suffer. And he will get the greatest comfort when he learns, that not an unlearned man,

<p>I Clement, being a Roman citizen,900 even from my earliest youth was able to live
chastely, my mind from my boyhood drawing away the lust that was in me to dejection and
distress. For I had a habit of reasoning—how originating I know not—making frequent
cogitations concerning death: When I die, shall I neither exist, nor shall any one ever have
any remembrance of me, while boundless time bears all things of all men into forgetfulness?
and shall I then be without being, or acquaintance with those who are; neither knowing nor
being known, neither having been nor being? And has the world ever been made? and was
there anything before it was made? For if it has been always, it shall also continue to be; but
if it has been made, it shall also be dissolved. And after its dissolution, shall there ever be
anything again, unless, perhaps, silence and forgetfulness? Or perhaps something shall be
which is not possible now to conceive.</p>

<p>As I pondered without ceasing these and such like questions—I know not whence
arising—I had such bitter grief, that, becoming pale, I wasted away; and, what was most
terrible, if at any time I wished to drive away this meditation as unprofitable, my suffering
became all the more severe; and I grieved over this, not knowing that I had a fair inmate,
even my thought, which was to be to me the cause of a blessed immortality, as I afterwards
knew by experience, and gave thanks to God, the Lord of all. For it was by this thought,
which at first afflicted me, that I was compelled to come to the search and the finding of
things; and then I pitied those whom at first, through ignorance, I ventured to call blessed.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Perplexity.</head>
<p>From my boyhood, then, being involved in such reasonings, in order to learn something
definite, I used to resort to the schools of the philosophers. But nought else did I see than
the setting up and the knocking down of doctrines, and strifes, and seeking for victory, and
the arts of syllogisms, and the skill of assumptions; and sometimes one opinion prevailed,—as,
for example, that the soul is immortal, and sometimes that it is mortal. If, therefore, at any
time the doctrine prevailed that it is immortal, I was glad; and when the doctrine prevailed
that it is mortal, I was grieved. And again, I was the more disheartened because I could not
establish either doctrine to my satisfaction. However, I perceived that the opinions on
subjects under discussion are taken as true or false, according to their defenders, and do
not appear as they really are. Perceiving, therefore, now that the acceptance does not depend
on the real nature of the subjects discussed, but that opinions are proved to be true or false,
according to ability of those who defend them, I was still more than ever at a loss in regard
of things. Wherefore I groaned from the depth of my soul. For neither was I able to establish
anything, nor could I shake off the consideration of such things, though, as I said before, I
wished it. For although I frequently charged myself to be at peace, in some way or other
thoughts on these subjects, accompanied with a feeling of pleasure, would come into my
mind.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="681"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—More Perplexity.</head>
<p>And again, living in doubt, I said to myself, Why do I labour in vain, when the matter
is clear, that if I lose existence when I die, it is not fitting that I should distress myself now
while I do exist? Wherefore I shall reserve my grief till that day, when, ceasing to exist, I
shall not be affected with grief. But if I am to exist, what does it profit me now to distress
myself gratuitously? And immediately after this another reasoning assailed me; for I said,
Shall I not have something worse to suffer then than that which distresses me now, if I have
not lived piously; and shall I not be delivered over, according to the doctrines of some
philosophers, to Pyriphlegethon and Tartarus, like Sisyphus, or Tityus, or Ixion, or Tantalus,
and be punished for ever in Hades? But again I replied, saying: But there are no such things
as these. Yet again I said: But if there be? Therefore, said I, since the matter is uncertain,
the safer plan is for me rather to live piously. But how shall I be able, for the sake of righteousness,
to subdue bodily pleasures, looking, as I do, to an uncertain hope? But I am neither
fully persuaded what is that righteous thing that is pleasing to God, nor do I know whether
the soul is immortal or mortal. Neither can I find any well-established doctrine, nor can I
abstain from such debatings.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="682"/>
<head>Chapter V.—A Resolution.</head>
<p>What, then, am I to do, unless this? I shall go into Egypt, and I shall become friendly
with the hierophants of the shrines, and with the prophets; and I shall seek and find a magician,
and persuade him with large bribes to effect the calling up of a soul, which is called
necromancy, as if I were going to inquire of it concerning some business. And the inquiry
shall be for the purpose of learning whether the soul is immortal. But the answer of the soul
that it is immortal shall not give me the knowledge from its speaking or my hearing, but
only from its being seen; so that, seeing it with my very eyes, I may have a self-sufficient and
fit assurance, from the very fact of its appearing, that it exists; and never again shall the uncertain
words of hearing be able to overturn the things which the eyes have made their own.
However, I submitted this very plan to a certain companion who was a philosopher; and he
counselled me not to venture upon it, and that on many accounts. “For if,” said he, “the
soul shall not listen to the magician, you will live with an evil conscience, as having acted
against the laws which forbid the doing of these things. But if it shall listen to him, then,
besides your living with an evil conscience, I think that matters of piety will not be promoted
to you on account of your making this attempt. For they say that the Deity is angry with
those who disturb souls after their release from the body.”901 And I, when I heard this, became
indeed more backward to undertake such a thing, but I did not abandon my original
plan; but I was distressed, as being hindered in the execution of it.</p>

such reasonings and doings, a certain report, taking its rise in the spring-time,902 in the
reign of Tiberius Cæsar, gradually grew everywhere, and ran through the world as truly the
good tidings of God, being unable to stifle the counsel of God in silence. Therefore it
everywhere became greater and louder, saying that a certain One in Judæa, beginning in
the spring season, was preaching to the Jews the kingdom of the invisible God, and saying
that whoever of them would reform his manner of living should enjoy it. And in order that
He might be believed that He uttered these things full of the Godhead, He wrought many
wonderful miracles and signs by His mere command, as having received power from God.
For He made the deaf to hear, the blind to see, the lame to walk, raised up the bowed down,
drove away every disease, put to flight every demon; and even scabbed lepers, by only
looking on Him from a distance, were sent away cured by Him; and the dead being brought
to Him, were raised; and there was nothing which He could not do. And as time advanced,
so much the greater, through the arrival of more persons, and the stronger grew—I say not
now the report, but—the truth of the thing; for now at length there were meetings in various
places for consultation and inquiry as to who He might be that had appeared, and what was
His purpose.</p>

eternal life to all who will, if they shall live according to the counsel of the Father, who hath
sent Him. Wherefore change your manner of life from the worse to the better, from things
temporal to things eternal; for know ye that there is one God, who is in heaven, whose world
ye unrighteously dwell in before His righteous eyes. But if ye be changed, and live according
to His counsel, then, being born into the other world, and becoming eternal, ye shall enjoy
His unspeakable good things. But if ye be unbelieving, your souls, after the dissolution of
the body, shall be thrown into the place of fire, where, being punished eternally, they shall
repent of their unprofitable deeds. For every one, the term of repentance is the present
life.” I therefore, when I heard these things, was grieved, because no one among so great
multitudes, hearing such an announcement, said: I shall go into Judæa, that I may know if
this man who tells us these things speaks the truth, that the Son of God has come into Judæa,
for the sake of a good and eternal hope, revealing the will of the Father who sent Him. For
it is no small matter which they say that He preaches: for He asserts that the souls of some,
being themselves immortal, shall enjoy eternal good things; and that those of others, being

occurred a long time of delay, my worldly affairs being difficult to arrange. Therefore,
meditating further on the nature of life, that by involving904 men in hope it lays snares for
those who are making haste, yea, and how much time I had been robbed of while tossed by
hopes, and that we men die while thus occupied, I left all my affairs as they were, and sped
to Portus;905 and coming to the harbour, and being taken on board a ship, I was borne by
adverse winds to Alexandria instead of Judæa; and being detained there by stress of weather,
I consorted with the philosophers, and told them about the rumour and the sayings of him
who had appeared in Rome. And they answered that indeed they knew nothing of him who
had appeared in Rome; but concerning Him who was born in Judæa, and who was said by
the report to be the Son of God, they had heard from many who had come from thence,
and had learned respecting all the wonderful things that He did with a word.</p>

making use of this preface after each interruption: We have a commission only to tell you

<p>When he said this, they all, as in concert, set up a shout of laughter, trying to silence
him and put him out, as a barbarous madman. But I, seeing this, and seized, I know not
how, with enthusiasm, could no longer keep silence with righteous indignation, but boldly
cried out, saying, “Well has God ordained that His counsel should be incapable of being
received by you, foreseeing you to be unworthy, as appears manifestly to such of those who
are now present as have minds capable of judging. For whereas now heralds of His counsel
have been sent forth, not making a show of grammatical art, but setting forth His will in
simple and in artificial words, so that whosoever hear can understand what is spoken, and
not with any invidious feeling, as though unwilling to offer it to all; you come here, and
besides your not understanding what is for your advantage, to your own injury you laugh
at the truth, which, to your condemnation, consorts with the barbarians, and which you
will not entertain when it visits you, by reason of your wickedness and the plainness of its
words, lest you be convicted of being merely lovers of words, and not lovers of truth and
lovers of wisdom. How long will you be learning to speak, who have not the power of
speech?907 For many sayings of yours are not worth one word. What, then, will your Grecian
multitude say, being of one mind, if, as he says, there shall be a judgment? “Why, O God,
didst Thou not proclaim to us Thy counsel?” Shall you not, if you be thought worthy of an
answer at all, be told this? “I, knowing before the foundation of the world all characters
that were to be, acted towards each one by anticipation according to his deserts without
making it known;908 but wishing to give full assurance to those who have fled to me that
this is so, and to explain why from the beginning, and in the first ages, I did not suffer my
counsel to be publicly proclaimed; I now, in the end of the world,909 have sent heralds to
proclaim my will, and they are insulted and flouted by those who will not be benefited, and
who wilfully reject my friendship. Oh, great wrong! The preachers are exposed to danger

among the crowd; and some as pitying Barnabas, sympathized with me; but others, being
senseless, terribly gnashed their teeth against me. But, as the evening had already come, I
took Barnabas by the hand, and by force conducted him, against his will, to my lodging,
and constrained him to remain there, lest some one might lay hands on him. And having
spent several days, and instructed me briefly in the true doctrine, as well as he could in a

adorn them with my speech, and preach the counsel of God; and if you do so, within a few
days I will sail with you, for I greatly desire to go to the land of Judæa, and perhaps I shall
dwell with you all my life;”—when he heard this, he answered: “If you wish to inquire into
our affairs, and to learn what is for your advantage, sail with me at once. But if you will not,
I shall now give you directions to my house, and that of those whom you wish to meet, that
when you choose to come you may find us. For I shall set out to-morrow for my home.”
And when I saw that he could not be prevailed upon, I went with him as far as the harbour;
and having learned of him the directions which he had promised to give me for finding the
dwellings, I said to him, “Were it not that to-morrow I am to recover a debt that is due to
me, I should straightway set sail with you. But I shall soon overtake you.” And having said
this, and having given him in charge to those who commanded the ship, I returned grieving,

<p>But having spent some days, and not having been able to recover the whole debt, for the
sake of speed I neglected the balance, as being a hindrance, and myself also set sail for Judæa,
and in fifteen days arrived at Cæsarea Stratonis.911 And when I had landed, and was seeking
for a lodging, I learned that one named Peter, who was the most esteemed disciple of the
Man who had appeared in Judæa, and had done signs and wonders, was going to have a
verbal controversy next day with Simon, a Samaritan of Gitthi. When I heard this, I begged
to be shown his lodging; and as soon as I learned it, I stood before the door. And those who
were in the house, seeing me, discussed the question who I was, and whence I had come.
And, behold, Barnabas came out; and as soon as he saw me he embraced me, rejoicing
greatly, and weeping. And he took me by the hand, and conducted me to where Peter was,
saying to me, “This is Peter, of whom I told you as being the greatest in the wisdom of God,
and I have spoken to him of you continually. Therefore enter freely,912 for I have told him
your excellent qualities, without falsehood; and, at the same time, have disclosed to him
your intention, so that he himself also is desirous to see you. Therefore I offer him a great

O Peter, is Clement.”</p>

entertained the ambassador of the truth, so also truth herself shall constitute you, who are
a stranger, a citizen of her own city. And thus you shall greatly rejoice, because you have
now lent a small favour; I mean the kindness of good words. You shall be heir of blessings
which are both eternal and cannot possibly be taken from you. And do not trouble yourself

for this, I know not how, I gladly wish. However, I wish first to be convinced concerning
the truth, that I may know whether the soul is mortal or immortal; and whether, if it is
eternal, it is to be judged concerning the things which it hath done here. Also, whether
there is anything that is righteous and well-pleasing to God; and whether the world was
made, and for what end it was made; and whether it shall be dissolved; and if it shall be
dissolved, whether it shall be made better, or shall not be at all.” And not to mention them

Thereby is error, then fearlessness, unbelief, fornication, covetousness, vainglory; and ten

the sight of the men inhabiting the world, and have not suffered them to look up and become

to know what is pleasing to Him. Wherefore it behoves the lovers of truth, crying out inwardly

<p>“Now the Man who is the helper I call the true Prophet; and He alone is able to enlighten
the souls of men, so that with our own eyes we may be able to see the way of eternal salvation.
But otherwise it is impossible, as you also know, since you said a little while ago that every
doctrine is set up and pulled down, and the same is thought true or false, according to the
power of him who advocates it; so that doctrines do not appear as they are, but take the
appearance of being or not being truth or falsehood from those who advocate them.914 On
this account the whole business of religion needed a true prophet, that he might tell us things
that are, as they are, and how we must believe concerning all things. So that it is first necessary
to test the prophet by every prophetic sign, and having ascertained that he is true,
thereafter to believe him in every thing, and not to sit in judgment upon his several sayings,
but to receive them as certain, being accepted indeed by seeming faith, yet by sure judgment.
For by our initial proof, and by strict inquiry on every side, all things are received with right
reason. Wherefore before all things it is necessary to seek after the true Prophet, because
without Him it is impossible that any certainty can come to men.”</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Peter’s Satisfaction with Clement.</head>
<p>And, at the same time, he satisfied me by expounding to me who He is, and how He is
found, and holding Him forth to me as truly to be found, showing that the truth is more
manifest to the ear by the discourse of the prophet than things that are seen with the eye;
so that I was astonished, and wondered that no one sees those things which are sought after
by all, though they lie before him. However, having written this discourse concerning the
Prophet by his order, he caused the volume to be despatched to you from Cæsarea Stratonis,
saying that he had a charge from you to send his discourses and his acts year by year.915
Thus, on the very first day, beginning only concerning the prophet of the truth, he confirmed
me in every respect; and then he spoke thus: “Henceforth give heed to the discussions that
take place between me and those on the other side; and even if I come off at a disadvantage,
I am not afraid of your ever doubting of the truth that has been delivered to you, knowing
well that I seem to be beaten, but not the doctrine that has been delivered to us by the
Prophet. However, I hope not to come off in our inquiries at a disadvantage with men who
have understanding—I mean lovers of truth, who are able to know what discourses are
specious, artificial, and pleasant, and what are unartificial and simple, trusting only to the
truth that is conveyed through them.”</p>
<note type="footnote">915 The text is probably corrupt or defective. As it stands, grammatically Peter writes the discourse and sends
it, and yet “by his order” must also apply to Peter. The Recognitions make Clement write the book and send it.

<head>Chapter XXI.—Unalterable Conviction.</head>
<p>When he had thus spoken, I answered: “Now do I thank God; for as I wished to be
convinced, so He has vouchsafed to me. However, so far as concerns me, be you so far
without anxiety that I shall never doubt; so much so, that if you yourself should ever wish
to remove me from the prophetic doctrine, you should not be able, so well do I know what
I have received. And do not think that it is a great thing that I promise you that I shall
never doubt; for neither I myself, nor any man who has heard your discourse concerning
the Prophet, can ever doubt of the true doctrine, having first heard and understood what is
the truth of the prophetic announcement. Wherefore have confidence in the God-willed
dogma; for every art of wickedness has been conquered. For against prophecy, neither arts
of discourses, nor tricks of sophisms, nor syllogisms, nor any other contrivance, can prevail
anything; that is, if he who has heard the true Prophet really is desirous of truth, and does
not give heed to aught else under pretext of truth. So that, my lord Peter, be not disconcerted,
as though you had presented the greatest good to a senseless person; for you have presented
it to one sensible of the favour, and who cannot be seduced from the truth that has been
committed to him. For I know that it is one of those things which one wishes to receive
quickly, and not to attain slowly. Therefore I know that I should not despise, on account
of the quickness with which I have got it, what has been committed to me, what is incomparable,

of prophecy. Since, then, as you say, if I myself should ever wish—which God forbid—to
transfer you to another doctrine, I shall not be able to persuade you, begin from to-morrow
to attend upon me in the discussions with the adversaries. And to-morrow I have one with
Simon Magus.” And having spoken thus, and he himself having partaken of food in private,
he ordered me also to partake;916 and having blessed the food, and having given thanks
after being satisfied, and having giving me an account of this matter, he went on to say:
“May God grant you in all things to be made like unto me, and having been baptized, to
partake of the same table with me.” And having thus spoken, he enjoined me to go to rest;

seeking the truth, reject some of the suppositions that are presented to them, and lay hold
of others, as if they knew, while they do not know, what things are true and what are false.
And they dogmatize concerning truth, even those who are seeking after truth, not knowing

But the truth is that which is approved by the Prophet, not that which is pleasant to each
individual. For that which is one would be many, if the pleasing were the true; which is
impossible. Wherefore also the Grecian philologers—rather than philosophers921—going

anything, he has received it from Him or from His disciples. And this is His doctrine and
true proclamation, that there is one God, whose work the world is; who being altogether
righteous, shall certainly at some time render to every one according to his deeds.</p>

<p>“For there is every necessity, that he who says that God is by His nature righteous, should
believe also that the souls of men are immortal: for where would be His justice, when some,
having lived piously, have been evil-treated, and sometimes violently cut off, while others
who have been wholly impious, and have indulged in luxurious living, have died the common
death of men? Since therefore, without all contradiction, God who is good is also just, He
shall not otherwise be known to be just, unless the soul after its separation from the body
be immortal, so that the wicked man, being in hell,922 as having here received his good
things, may there be punished for his sins; and the good man, who has been punished here
for his sins, may then, as in the bosom of the righteous, be constituted an heir of good things.
Since therefore God is righteous, it is fully evident to us that there is a judgment, and that
souls are immortal.</p>

<p>“But if any one, according to the opinion of this Simon the Samaritan, will not admit
that God is just, to whom then can any one ascribe justice, or the possibility of it? For if the
Root of all have it not, there is every necessity to think that it must be impossible to find it
in human nature, which, is, as it were, the fruit. And if it is to be found in man, how much
more in God! But if righteousness can be found nowhere, neither in God nor in man, then
neither can unrighteousness. But there is such a thing as righteousness, for unrighteousness
takes its name from the existence of righteousness; for it is called unrighteousness, when

<head>Chapter XV.—Pairs.</head>
<p>“Hence therefore God, teaching men with respect to the truth of existing things, being
Himself one, has distinguished all principles into pairs and opposites,923 Himself being one
and sole God from the beginning, having made heaven and earth, day and night, light and
fire, sun and moon, life and death. But man alone amongst these He made self-controlling,
having a fitness to be either righteous or unrighteous. To him also he hath varied the figures
of combinations, placing before him small things first, and great ones afterwards, such as
the world and eternity. But the world that now is, is temporary; that which shall be, is
eternal. First is ignorance, then knowledge. So also has He arranged the leaders of prophecy.
For, since the present world is female, as a mother bringing forth the souls of her children,
but the world to come is male, as a father receiving his children from their mother, therefore
in this world there come a succession of prophets, as being sons of the world to come, and
having knowledge of men. And if pious men had understood this mystery, they would
never have gone astray, but even now they should have known that Simon, who now enthralls
all men, is a fellow-worker of error and deceit. Now, the doctrine of the prophetic rule is
as follows.</p>

<p>“As in the beginning God, who is one, like a right hand and a left, made the heavens
first and then the earth, so also He constituted all the combinations in order; but upon men
He no more does this, but varies all the combinations. For whereas from Him the greater
things come first, and the inferior second, we find the opposite in men—the first worse, and
the second superior. Therefore from Adam, who was made after the image of God, there
sprang first the unrighteous Cain, and then the righteous Abel. Again, from him who
amongst you is called Deucalion,924 two forms of spirits were sent forth, the impure namely,
and the pure, first the black raven, and then the white dove. From Abraham also, the patriarchs
of our nation, two firsts925 sprang—Ishmael first, then Isaac, who was blessed of God.
And from Isaac himself, in like manner, there were again two—Esau the profane, and Jacob
the pious. So, first in birth, as the first born in the world, was the high priest Aaron, then
the lawgiver Moses.</p>

<p>“In like manner, the combination with respect to Elias, which behoved to have come,
has been willingly put off to another time, having determined to enjoy it conveniently
hereafter.926 Wherefore, also, he who was among those born of woman came first; then he
who was among the sons of men came second. It were possible, following this order, to
perceive to what series Simon belongs, who came before me to the Gentiles, and to which
I belong who have come after him, and have come in upon him as light upon darkness, as
knowledge upon ignorance, as healing upon disease. And thus, as the true Prophet has told
us, a false prophet must first come from some deceiver; and then, in like manner, after the
removal of the holy place, the true Gospel must be secretly sent abroad for the rectification
of the heresies that shall be. After this, also, towards the end, Antichrist must first come,
and then our Jesus must be revealed to be indeed the Christ; and after this, the eternal light
having sprung up, all the things of darkness must disappear.</p>
<note type="footnote">926 In this sentence the text is probably corrupted. The general meaning seems to be, that he does not enter

hearing this, and begging to partake like a dog of the crumbs that fall from this table, having
changed what she was,929 by living like the sons of the kingdom, she obtained healing for
her daughter, as she asked. For she being a Gentile, and remaining in the same course of

accurately everything about this man, whose he is, and what, and whence; and what the
things are which he does, and how and why he does them.931 This Simon is the son of
Antonius and Rachel, a Samaritan by race, of the village of Gitthæ, which is six schoeni
distant from the city. He having disciplined himself greatly in Alexandria,932 and being
very powerful in magic, and being ambitious, wishes to be accounted a certain supreme
power, greater even than the God who created the world. And sometimes intimating that
he is Christ, he styles himself the Standing One.933 And this epithet he employs, as intimating
that he shall always stand, and as not having any cause of corruption so that his body should
fall. And he neither says that the God who created the world is the Supreme, nor does he
believe that the dead will be raised. He rejects Jerusalem, and substitutes Mount Gerizzim
for it. Instead of our Christ, he proclaims himself. The things of the law he explains by his
own presumption; and he says, indeed, that there is to be a judgment, but he does not expect
it. For if he were persuaded that he shall be judged by God, he would not dare be impious
towards God Himself. Whence some not knowing that, using religion as a cloak, he spoils
the things of the truth, and faithfully believing the hope and the judgment which in some
way he says are to be, are ruined.</p>

<p>“But that he came to deal with the doctrines of religion happened on this wise. There

forerunner of our Lord Jesus; and as the Lord had twelve apostles, bearing the number of
the twelve months of the sun, so also he, John, had thirty chief men, fulfilling the monthly
reckoning of the moon, in which number was a certain woman called Helena,935 that not
even this might be without a dispensational significance. For a woman, being half a man,
made up the imperfect number of the triacontad; as also in the case of the moon, whose revolution
does not make the complete course of the month.936 But of these thirty, the first

But Simon, returning not long after, and strenuously holding by the place as his own, when
he met with Dositheus did not demand the place, knowing that a man who has attained
power beyond his expectations cannot be removed from it. Wherefore with pretended
friendship he gives himself for a while to the second place, under Dositheus. But taking his
place after a few days among the thirty fellow-disciples, he began to malign Dositheus as
not delivering the instructions correctly. And this he said that he did, not through unwillingness
to deliver them correctly, but through ignorance. And on one occasion, Dositheus,
perceiving that this artful accusation of Simon was dissipating the opinion of him with respect
to many, so that they did not think that he was the Standing One, came in a rage to the
usual place of meeting, and finding Simon, struck him with a staff. But it seemed to pass
through the body of Simon as if he had been smoke. Thereupon Dositheus, being confounded,
said to him, ‘If you are the Standing One, I also will worship you.’ Then Simon said
that he was; and Dositheus, knowing that he himself was not the Standing One, fell down
and worshipped; and associating himself with the twenty-nine chiefs, he raised Simon to
his own place of repute; and thus, not many days after, Dositheus himself, while he (Simon)
stood, fell down and died.</p>

heavens to the world; being queen, as the all-bearing being, and wisdom, for whose sake,
says he, the Greeks and barbarians fought, having before their eyes but an image of truth;938
for she, who really is the truth, was then with the chiefest god. Moreover, by cunningly explaining
certain things of this sort, made up from Grecian myths, he deceives many; especially
as he performs many signal marvels, so that if we did not know that he does these things by

assistant for the exhibition of anything that he pleased, and having drawn the likeness of
the boy, he has it set up in the inner room where he sleeps, saying that he once formed the
boy of air, by divine arts, and having painted his likeness, he gave him back again to the air.
And he explains that he did the deed thus. He says that the first soul of man, being turned
into the nature of heat, drew to itself, and sucked in the surrounding air, after the fashion
of a gourd;940 and then that he changed it into water, when it was within the form of the
spirit; and he said that he changed into the nature of blood the air that was in it, which could
not be poured out on account of the consistency of the spirit, and that he made the blood
solidified into flesh; then, the flesh being thus consolidated, that he exhibited a man not
made from earth, but from air. And thus, having persuaded himself that he was able to
make a new sort of man, he said that he reversed the changes, and again restored him to the
air. And when he told this to others, he was believed; but by us who were present at his ceremonies
he was religiously disbelieved. Wherefore we denounced his impieties, and

Tell me, O Simon, even if no one else has been fully convinced that the soul is immortal, at
all events you and we ought to be so: you as having separated one from a human body, and
conversed with it, and laid your commands upon it; and we as having been present, and
heard your commands, and clearly witnessed the performance of what was ordered.’ Then

you reason.’ Then said Nicetas: ‘If you know, speak; but if you do not know, do not suppose
that we can be deceived by your saying that you know, and that we do not. For we are not

to me, for it does not exist; but a certain demon works, pretending to be the soul.’ Then
said Nicetas: ‘Many incredible things we have heard in our lifetime, but aught more senseless
than this speech we do not expect ever to hear. For if a demon pretends to be the soul of
the dead person, what is the use of the soul at all, that it should be separated from the body?
Were not we ourselves present and heard you conjuring the soul from the body? And how
comes it that, when one is conjured, another who is not conjured obeys, as if it were
frightened? And you yourself, when at any time we have asked you why the conferences
sometimes cease, did not you say that the soul, having fulfilled the time upon earth which

is it afraid of, that it does not despise the conjuration? Then Simon said: ‘It knows that it
should suffer punishment if it were disobedient.’ Then said Aquila: ‘Therefore, if the soul
comes when conjured, there is also a judgment. If, therefore, souls are immortal, assuredly
there is also a judgment. As you say, then, that those which are conjured on wicked business
are punished if they disobey, how are you not afraid to compel them, when those that are
compelled are punished for disobedience? For it is not wonderful that you do not already
suffer for your doings, seeing the judgment has not yet come, when you are to suffer the
penalty of those deeds which you have compelled others to do, and when that which has
been done under compulsion shall be pardoned, as having been out of respect for the oath
which led to the evil action.’942 And he hearing this was enraged, and threatened death to

and contraries, and as the night is first, and then the day; and first ignorance, then knowledge;
first disease, then healing, so the things of error come first into our life, then truth supervenes,
as the physician upon the disease. Therefore straightway, when our God-loved nation was
about to be ransomed from the oppression of the Egyptians, first diseases were produced
by means of the rod turned into a serpent, which was given to Aaron, and then remedies
were superinduced by the prayers of Moses. And now also, when the Gentiles are about to
be ransomed from the superstition with respect to idols, wickedness, which reigns over
them, has by anticipation sent forth her ally like another serpent, even this Simon whom
you see, who works wonders to astonish and deceive, not signs of healing to convert and
save. Wherefore it behoves you also from the miracles that are done to judge the doers,
what is the character of the performer, and what that of the deed. If he do unprofitable
miracles, he is the agent of wickedness; but if he do profitable things, he is a leader of

such of the people as chose, after a little the written law had added to it certain falsehoods
contrary to the law of God,946 who made the heaven and the earth, and all things in them;
the wicked one having dared to work this for some righteous purpose. And this took place
in reason and judgment, that those might be convicted who should dare to listen to the
things written against God, and those who, through love towards Him, should not only
disbelieve the things spoken against Him, but should not even endure to hear them at all,
even if they should happen to be true, judging it much safer to incur danger with respect to

before the discussion, you shall be instructed concerning the chapters added to the Scriptures;
and then in the discussion concerning the only one and good God, the Maker also of the
world, you ought not to be distracted. But in the discussion you will even wonder how impious
men, overlooking the multitudes of things that are spoken in the Scriptures for God,
and looking at those that are spoken against Him, gladly bring these forward; and thus the

that all things are for God. Wherefore do not suppose that I ask questions, as doubting the
words concerning God,948 or those that are to be spoken, but rather that I may learn, and
so be able myself to instruct another who is ingenuously willing to learn. Wherefore tell
me what are the falsehoods added to the Scriptures, and how it comes that they are really
false.” Then Peter answered: “Even although you had not asked me, I should have gone on

of his having received foreknowledge from God; how then, should He, who gave to man
the gift of foreknowledge, being God, Himself be ignorant?” And I said: “You have spoken
rightly.” Then Peter said: “Come with me one step further. It being acknowledged by us

And not only he; but if any other shall recount to those from among the Gentiles any vain,

in any other way be guilty of impiety against Him, and then shall repent, he shall be punished

But we also can easily show many passages from them that He who made the world alone
is God, and that there is none other besides Him. But if any one shall wish to speak otherwise,

from a prophet of truth. But He is a true Prophet, who always knows all things, and even
the thoughts of all men, who is without sin, as being convinced respecting the judgment of
God. Wherefore we ought not simply to consider respecting His foreknowledge, but
whether His foreknowledge can stand, apart from other cause. For physicians predict certain
things, having the pulse of the patient as matter submitted to them; and some predict by
means of having fowls, and some by having sacrifices, and others by having many various

that foreknowledge which is really implanted, he were much deceived. For he only declares
such things as being present, and that if he speaks truth. However, even these things are
serviceable to me, for they establish that there is such a thing as foreknowledge. But the
foreknowledge of the one true Prophet does not only know things present, but stretches out
prophecy without limit as far as the world to come, and needs nothing for its interpretation,
not prophesying darkly and ambiguously, so that the things spoken would need another
prophet for the interpretation of them; but clearly and simply, as our Master and Prophet,

the boundless eye of His soul, He knows hidden things. But if we should hold, as many do,
that even the true Prophet, not always, but sometimes, when He has the Spirit, and through
it, foreknows, but when He has it not is ignorant,—if we should suppose thus, we should
deceive ourselves and mislead others. For such a matter belongs to those who are madly

will be difficult to convict him of being a false prophet; for among the many things that he

<head>Chapter XV.—Christ’s Prophecies.</head>
<p>“But our Master did not prophesy after this fashion; but, as I have already said, being a
prophet by an inborn and ever-flowing Spirit, and knowing all things at all times, He confidently
set forth, plainly as I said before, sufferings, places, appointed times, manners,
limits. Accordingly, therefore, prophesying concerning the temple, He said: ‘See ye these
buildings? Verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another which
shall not be taken away; and this generation shall not pass until the destruction begin. For
they shall come, and shall sit here, and shall besiege it, and shall slay your children here.’958
And in like manner He spoke in plain words the things that were straightway to happen,
which we can now see with our eyes, in order that the accomplishment might be among
those to whom the word was spoken. For the Prophet of truth utters the word of proof in
order to the faith of His hearers.</p>

<p>“But I shall begin the statement now. God having made all things, if any one will not
allow to a man, fashioned by His hands, to have possessed His great and Holy Spirit of
foreknowledge, how does not he greatly err who attributes it to another born of a spurious
stock!959 And I do not think that he will obtain pardon, though he be misled by spurious
scripture to think dreadful things against the Father of all. For he who insults the image
and the things belonging to the eternal King, has the sin reckoned as committed against
Him in whose likeness the image was made. But then, says he, the Divine Spirit left him
when he sinned. In that case the Spirit sinned along with him; and how can he escape peril
who says this? But perhaps he received the Spirit after he sinned. Then it is given to the
unrighteous; and where is justice? But it was afforded to the just and the unjust. This were
most unrighteous of all. Thus every falsehood, though it be aided by ten thousand reasonings,
must receive its refutation, though after a long time.</p>

sends to him those desirous of knowledge, saying, ‘Ask your father, and he will tell you;
your elders, and they will declare to you.’960 This father, these elders ought to be inquired
of. But you have not inquired whose is the time of the kingdom, and whose is the seat of
prophecy, though He Himself points out Himself, saying, ‘The scribes and the Pharisees sit
in Moses’ seat; all things whatsoever they say to you, hear them.’961 Hear them, He said, as
entrusted with the key of the kingdom, which is knowledge, which alone can open the gate
of life, through which alone is the entrance to eternal life. But truly, He says, they possess
the key, but those wishing to enter they do not suffer to do so.</p>

<p>“On this account, I say, He Himself, rising from His seat as a father for his children,
proclaiming the things which from the beginning were delivered in secret to the worthy,
extending mercy even to the Gentiles, and compassionating the souls of all, neglected His
own kindred. For He, being thought worthy to be King of the world to come, fights against962
him who, by predestination, has usurped the kingdom that now is. And the thing which
exceedingly grieved Him is this, that by those very persons for whom, as for sons, he did
battle, He was assailed, on account of their ignorance. And yet He loved even those who
hated Him, and wept over the unbelieving, and blessed those who slandered Him, and
prayed for those who were in enmity against Him.963 And not only did He do this as a
father, but also taught His disciples to do the like, bearing themselves as towards brethren.964
This did our Father, this did our Prophet. This is reasonable, that He should be King over
His children; that by the affection of a father towards his children, and the engrafted respect
of children towards their father, eternal peace might be produced. For when the good man
reigneth, there is true joy among those who are ruled over, on account of him who rules.</p>

of this present world, wishes to be thought masculine.969 Wherefore, stealing the
seeds of the male, and sowing them with her own seeds of the flesh, she brings forth the

the love of the parents towards her.971 But if it be none of these, then it will befall him to
be called the Possession. For she possessed him first, which also was advantageous to him.
For he was a murderer and a liar, and with his sins was not willing to be at peace with respect

pleased with the temporary flower of flesh, and spoiling the strength of the judgment by

Bridegroom from His kingdom. But to those who know the mystery, death is also produced
by spiritual adultery. For whenever the soul is sown by others, then it is forsaken by the
Spirit, as guilty of fornication or adultery; and so the living body, the life-giving Spirit being
withdrawn, is dissolved into dust, and the rightful punishment of sin is suffered at the time
of the judgment by the soul, after the dissolution of the body; even as, among men, she who
is caught in adultery is first cast out from the house, and then afterwards is condemned to

already perfected: “Let us rise and pray that God, by His unfailing mercies, may help me
striving for the salvation of the men whom He has made.” And having thus said, and having

down, and see whether they do according to their cry which comes to me; or if not, that I

us drive him out, lest he put forth his hand and touch the tree of life, and eat, and live for

he who avoids the order of inquiry, does not wish a true investigation to be made. Hence
I, who proceed in an orderly manner, and wish that the writer should first be considered,
am manifestly desirous to walk in a straight path.” Then Simon: “First confess that if the
things written against the Creator are true, he is not above all, since, according to the
Scriptures, he is subject to all evil; then afterwards we shall inquire as to the writer.” Then
said Peter: “That I may not seem to speak against your want of order through unwillingness

of him; wherefore neither the one nor the other can be confirmed.” Then Simon: “How,
then, is the truth to be ascertained, of those Scriptures that say he is evil, or of those that say
he is good?” Then Peter: “Whatever sayings of the Scriptures are in harmony with the
creation that was made by Him are true, but whatever are contrary to it are false.”986 Then
Simon said: “How can you show that the Scriptures contradict themselves?” And Peter
said: “You say that Adam was created blind, which was not so; for He would not have
pointed out the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to a blind man, and commanded
him not to taste of it.” Then said Simon: “He meant that his mind was blind.” Then Peter:
“How could he be blind in respect of his mind, who, before tasting of the tree, in harmony
with Him who made him, imposed appropriate names on all the animals?” Then Simon:
“If Adam had foreknowledge, how did he not foreknow that the serpent would deceive his
wife?” Then Peter: “If Adam had not foreknowledge, how did he give names to the sons
of men as they were born with reference to their future doings, calling the first Cain (which
is interpreted ‘envy’), who through envy killed his brother Abel (which is interpreted ‘grief’),

created him. And that is false which is written that God reflected, as if using reasoning on
account of ignorance; and that the Lord tempted Abraham, that He might know if he would
endure it; and that which is written, ‘Let us go down, and see if they are doing according to
the cry of them which cometh to me; and if not, that I may know.’ And, not to extend my
discourse too far, whatever sayings ascribe ignorance to Him, or anything else that is evil,
being upset by other sayings which affirm the contrary, are proved to be false. But because
He does indeed foreknow, He says to Abraham, ‘Thou shalt assuredly know that thy seed
shall be sojourners in a land that is not their own; and they shall enslave them, and shall evil
entreat them, and humble them four hundred years. But the nation to which they shall be
in bondage will I judge, and after that they shall come out hither with much property; but
thou shalt depart to thy fathers with peace, being nourished in a good old age; and in the
fourth generation they shall return hither, for the sins of the Amorites are hitherto not filled

not wishing them to be slain, did not ordain sacrifices as desiring them; nor from the beginning

animals, nor can the first-fruits be presented. But how is it possible for Him to abide in
darkness, and smoke, and storm (for this also is written), who created a pure heaven, and

innumerable stars? Thus, O Simon, the handwriting of God—I mean the heaven—shows

that Moses was taken up, it was written by some one, but not by Moses. For in the law itself
it is written, ‘And Moses died; and they buried him near the house of Phogor,989 and no
one knows his sepulchre till this day.’ But how could Moses write that Moses died? And
whereas in the time after Moses, about 500 years or thereabouts, it is found lying in the
temple which was built, and after about 500 years more it is carried away, and being burnt
in the time of Nebuchadnezzar it is destroyed; and thus being written after Moses, and often
lost, even this shows the foreknowledge of Moses, because he, foreseeing its disappearance,
did not write it; but those who wrote it, being convicted of ignorance through their not
foreseeing its disappearance, were not prophets.”990</p>

in years, lest burning lust bring a plague upon the Church by reason of whoredom or adultery.
For, above every other sin, the wickedness of adultery is hated by God, because it not
only destroys the person himself who sins, but those also who eat and associate with him.
For it is like the madness of a dog, because it has the nature of communicating its own
madness. For the sake of chastity, therefore, let not only the elders, but even all, hasten to
accomplish marriage. For the sin of him who commits adultery necessarily comes upon
all. Therefore, to urge the brethren to be chaste, this is the first charity. For it is the healing
of the soul. For the nourishment of the body is rest.</p>

<head>Chapter LXIX.—“Not Forsaking the Assembling of Yourselves Together.”</head>
<p>“But if you love your brethren, take nothing from them, but share with them such things
as ye have. Feed the hungry; give drink to the thirsty; clothe the naked; visit the sick; so far
as you can, help those in prison; receive strangers gladly into your own abodes; hate no one.
And how you must be pious, your own mind will teach you, judging rightly. But before all
else, if indeed I need say it to you, come together frequently, if it were every hour, especially
on the appointed days of meeting. For if you do this, you are within a wall of safety. For
disorderliness is the beginning of perdition. Let no one therefore forsake the assembly on
the ground of envy towards a brother. For if any one of you forsake the assembly, he shall
be regarded as of those who scatter the Church of Christ, and shall be cast out with
adulterers. For as an adulterer, under the influence of the spirit that is in him, he separates
himself on some pretext, and gives place to the wicked one against himself,—a sheep for
the stealing, as one found outside the fold.1027</p>

<p>“But, brethren, there are some things that you must not wait to hear, but must consider
of yourselves what is reasonable. Zacchæus alone having given himself up wholly to labour
for you, and needing sustenance, and not being able to attend to his own affairs, how can
he procure necessary support? Is it not reasonable that you are to take forethought for his

of hunger than submit to do this. And shall not you incur punishment, not considering
that the workman is worthy of his hire? And let no one say: Is, then, the word sold which
was freely given? Far be it. For if any one has the means of living, and takes anything, he
sells the word; but if he who has not takes support in order to live—as the Lord also took at
supper and among His friends, having nothing, though He alone is the owner of all
things—he sins not. Therefore suitably honour elders, catechists, useful deacons, widows

me, under the guise of friendship.” Then said Appion: “Does it seem to you to be ignorance,
that one should observe the customs of his fathers, and judge after the manner of the
Greeks?” Then I answered: “It behoves one who desires to be pious not altogether to observe
the customs of his fathers; but to observe them if they be pious, and to shake them off if they
be impious. For it is possible that one who is the son of an impious father, if he wishes to
be pious, should not desire to follow the religion of his father.”1034 Then answered Appion:
“What then? Do you say that your father was a man of an evil life?” Then said I: “He was
not of an evil life, but of an evil opinion.” Then Appion: “I should like to know what was
his evil apprehension.” Then said I: “Because he believed the false and wicked myths of the

custom received, whether true or false, is strengthened by itself without the exercise of
judgment; and he who has received it is neither pleased with it as being true, nor grieved

subject to all kinds of passion; so that he who wishes to do the like things may not be ashamed,
which belongs to a man, having as an example the wicked and unquiet lives of the mythological
gods. And through his not being ashamed, such an one affords no hope of his repenting.
And others have introduced fate, which is called genesis, contrary to which no one can
suffer or do anything. This, therefore, also is like to the first. For any one who thinks that
no one has aught to do or suffer contrary to genesis easily falls into sin; and having sinned,
he does not repent of his impiety, holding it as his apology that he was borne on by genesis
to do these things. And as he cannot rectify genesis, he has no reason to be ashamed of the
sins he commits.1036</p>

and fore-judging and distributing to every one according to his deserving, they easily do
everything as they can through fearlessness. Therefore those who have such opinions do
not easily, or perhaps do not at all, live virtuously; for they do not foresee the danger which
might have the effect of converting them. But the doctrine of the barbarous Jews, as you
call them, is most pious, introducing One as the Father and Creator of all this world, by

those who wish to do things not to be spoken of, he begat Metis, and devoured her. But
Metis was seed; for it is impossible to devour a child. And for an excuse to abusers of
themselves with mankind, he carries away Ganymedes. And as a helper of adulterers in
their adultery, he is often found an adulterer. And to those who wish to commit incest with
sisters, he sets the example in his intercourse with his sisters Hera and Demeter, and the
heavenly Aphrodite, whom some call Dodona.1040 And to those who wish to commit incest

nature, but the unreasonable opinion of men make them terrible. But I say, that even if
these dreadful things do not occur, it is usual for a woman, through association with an
adulterer, either to forsake her husband, or if she continue to live with him, to plot against
him, or to bestow upon the adulterer the goods procured by the labour of her husband; and
having conceived by the adulterer while her husband is absent, to attempt the destruction
of that which is in her womb, through shame of conviction, and so to become a child-murderer;
or even, while destroying it, to be destroyed along with it. But if while her husband
is at home she conceives by the adulterer and bears a child, the child when he grows up does
not know his father, and thinks that he is his father who is not; and thus he who is not the
father, at his death leaves his substance to the child of another. And how many other evils
naturally spring from adultery! And the secret evils we do not know. For as the mad dog

<p>When I had thus spoken, Appion broke in upon my discourse. “What!” said he; “do
not the laws of the Greeks also forbid wickedness, and punish adulterers?” Then said I:
“Then the gods of the Greeks, who acted contrary to the laws, deserve punishment. But
how shall I be able to restrain myself, if I suppose that the gods themselves first practised
all wickednesses as well as adultery, and did not suffer punishment; whereas they ought the
rather to have suffered, as not being slaves to lust? But if they were subject to it, how were
they gods?” Then Appion said: “Let us have in our eye not the gods, but the judges; and
looking to them, we shall be afraid to sin.” Then I said: “This is not fitting, O Appion: for
he who has his eye upon men will dare to sin, in hope of escaping detection; but he who sets
before his soul the all-seeing God, knowing that he cannot escape His notice, will refrain
from sinning even in secret.”</p>

<p>When Appion heard this, he said: “I knew, ever since I heard that you were consorting
with Jews, that you had alienated your judgment. For it has been well said by some one,
‘Evil communications corrupt good manners.’” Then said I: “Therefore good communications
correct evil manners.” And Appion said: “Today I am fully satisfied to have learned
your position; therefore I permitted you to speak first. But to-morrow, in this place, if it is
agreeable to you, I will show, in the presence of these friends when they meet, that our gods
are neither adulterers, nor murderers, nor corrupters of children, nor guilty of incest with
sisters or daughters. But the ancients, wishing that only lovers of learning should know the
mysteries, veiled them with those fables of which you have spoken. For they speak
physiologically of boiling substance under the name of Zen, and of time under that of Kronos,
and of the ever-flowing nature of water under that of Rhea. However, as I have promised,
I shall to-morrow exhibit the truth of things, explaining them one by one to you when you

promised, so do. But now hear something in opposition to what you are going to say.</p>

was unable to sleep, I remembered a trick that I played upon him in Rome. It was this.
From my boyhood I Clement was a lover of truth, and a seeker of the things that are profitable
for the soul, and spending my time in raising and refuting theories; but being unable to find
anything perfect, through distress of mind I fell sick. And while I was confined to bed Appion
came to Rome, and being my father’s friend, he lodged with me; and hearing that I
was in bed, he came to me, as being not unacquainted with medicine, and inquired the cause
of my being in bed. But I, being aware that the man exceedingly hated the Jews, as also that
he had written many books against them, and that he had formed a friendship with this Simon,
not through desire of learning, but because he knew that he was a Samaritan and a
hater of the Jews, and that he had come forth in opposition to the Jews, therefore he had
formed an alliance with him, that he might learn something from him against the Jews;1046—</p>

of young men. And to this he said, ‘My son, speak freely as to a father: what is your soul’s
ailment?’ And when I again groaned feignedly, as being ashamed to speak of love, by means
of silence and down-looking I conveyed the impression of what I wished to intimate. But
he, being persuaded that I was in love with a woman, said: ‘There is nothing in life which
does not admit of help. For indeed I myself, when I was young, being in love with a most
accomplished woman, not only thought it impossible to obtain her, but did not even hope
ever to address her. And yet, having fallen in with a certain Egyptian who was exceedingly
well versed in magic, and having become his friend, I disclosed to him my love, and not
only did he assist me in all that I wished, but, honouring me more bountifully, he hesitated
not to teach me an incantation by means of which I obtained her; and as soon as I had obtained

I heard this, looking at the object I had in view, I said: ‘Pardon me that I do not altogether
believe in the existence of magic; for I have already tried many who have made many
promises, and have deceived me. However, your undertaking influences me, and leads me

that you may not think that there is nothing in what you have heard from me in reference
to what you have said, I will tell you how the demons are under necessity to obey the magicians
in the matters about which they are commanded. For as it is impossible for a soldier

if any one oppose those set over him, he is altogether deserving of punishment—so it is
impossible for the demons not to serve the angels who are their generals; and when they
are adjured by them, they yield trembling, well knowing that if they disobey they shall be
fully punished. But the angels also themselves, being adjured by the magicians in the name

that magic can subsist?’ Then he having told me that these things are so in Hades, I asked
him: ‘Why are not we ourselves afraid of magic, being persuaded of the punishment in

differ widely from one another. For he who constrains an unwilling woman by the force of
magic, subjects himself to the most terrible punishment, as having plotted against a chaste
woman; but he who persuades her with words, and puts the choice in her own power and
will, does not force her. And I am of opinion, that he who has persuaded a woman will not
suffer so great punishment as he who has forced her. Therefore, if you can persuade her, I

make more account of your fear than your desire: and you think that if you can persuade
her you shall be blameless, as without sin; but obtaining her by the power of magic, you will
incur punishment. But do you not know that it is the end of every action that is judged, the
fact that it has been committed, and that no account is made of the means by which it has
been effected? And if you commit adultery, being enabled by magic, shall you be judged as
having done wickedly; and if by persuasion, shall you be absolved from sin in respect of the
adultery?’ Then I said: ‘On account of my love, there is a necessity for me to choose one
or other of the means that are available to procure the object of my love; and I shall choose,
as far as possible, to cajole her rather than to use magic. But neither is it easy to persuade
her by flattery, for the woman is very much of a philosopher.’</p>

philosophers among men? For these alone know what works are good or evil by nature,
and what, not being so, are accounted so by the imposition of laws. Now, then, some have
supposed that the action which is called adultery is evil, although it is in every respect good.
For it is by the appointment of Eros for the increase of life. And Eros is the eldest of all the
gods. For without Eros there can be no mingling or generation either of elements, or gods,
or men, or irrational animals, or aught else. For we are all instruments of Eros. He, by
means of us, is the fabricator of all that is begotten, the mind inhabiting our souls. Hence
it is not when we ourselves wish it, but when we are ordered by him, that we desire to do
his will. But if, while we desire according to his will, we attempt to restrain the desire for

of lovers is not voluntary. Therefore Zeus himself, the giver of these laws, approached
myriads of women; and, according to some wise men, he sometimes had intercourse with

the leader of the gods,—he, I mean, who has to do with lusts. For if he lusts willingly, he is
himself his own suffering and punishment; and he who should suffer willingly could not be
a god. But if against his will he lust for copulation, and, pervading our souls as through the
members of our bodies, is borne into intermeddling with our minds, then he that impels
him to love is greater than he. And again, he who impels him, being himself impelled by
another desire, another greater than he is found impelling him. And thus we come to an

<head>Chapter XXIV.—If a Principle Be Good, Carry It Out.</head>
<p>“‘But if we must emulate their lives, let us imitate not only their adulteries, but also their
banquets. For Kronos devoured his own children, and Zeus in like manner his own
daughter. And what must I say? Pelops served as a supper for all the gods. Wherefore let
us also, before unhallowed marriages, perpetrate a supper like that of the gods; for thus the
supper would be worthy of the marriages. But this you would never consent to; no more
will I to adultery. Besides this, you threaten me with the anger of Eros as of a powerful god.
Eros is not a god, as I conceive him, but a desire occurring from the temperament of the
living creature in order to the perpetuation of life, according to the foresight of Him who
worketh all things, that the whole race may not fail, but by reason of pleasure another may
be produced out of the substance of one who shall die, springing forth by lawful marriage,
that he may know to sustain his own father in old age. And this those born from adultery
cannot do, not having the nature of affection towards those who have begotten them.</p>

increasing, as I have said, it behoves parents providing for the chastity of their children to
anticipate the desire, by imbuing them with instruction by means of chaste books, and to
accustom them beforehand by excellent discourses; for custom is a second nature. And in
addition to this, frequently to remind them of the punishments appointed by the laws, that,
using fear as a bridle, they may not run on in wicked pleasures. And it behoves them also,
before the springing of the desire, to satisfy the natural passion of puberty by marriage, first
persuading them not to look upon the beauty of another woman.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Close of the Answer.</head>
<p>“‘For our mind, whenever it is impressed delightfully with the image of a beloved one,
always seeing the form as in a mirror, is tormented by the recollection; and if it does not
obtain its desire, it contrives ways of obtaining it; but if it do obtain it, it is rather increased,
like fire having a supply of wood, and especially when there is no fear impressed upon the
soul of the lover before the rise of passion. For as water extinguishes fire, so fear is the extinguisher
of unreasonable desire. Whence I, having learned from a certain Jew both to
understand and to do the things that are pleasing to God, am not to be entrapped into
adultery by your lying fables. But may God help you in your wish and efforts to be chaste,

desires, and upon the investigation of true doctrines. And till now, although I have examined
many doctrines of philosophers, I have inclined to none of them, excepting only that of the

forthwith quitted Rome in silence. And as this is my first meeting with him since then, I
naturally expect his anger in consequence. However, I shall ask him in your presence what
he has to say concerning those who are called gods, whose lives, fabled to be filled with all

<p>“The wisest of the ancients, men who had by hard labour learned all truth, kept the path
of knowledge hid from those who were unworthy and had no taste for lessons in divine
things.1054 For it is not really true that from Ouranos and his mother Ge were born twelve
children, as the myth counts them: six sons, Okeanos, Koios, Krios, Hyperion, Japetos,
Kronos; and six daughters, Thea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Demeter, Tethys, and Rhea.1055
Nor that Kronos, with the knife of adamant, mutilated his father Ouranos, as you say, and
threw the part into the sea; nor that Aphrodite sprang from the drops of blood which flowed
from it; nor that Kronos associated with Rhea, and devoured his first-begotten son Pluto,
because a certain saying of Prometheus led him to fear that a child born from him would
wax stronger than himself, and spoil him of his kingdom; nor that he devoured in the same
way Poseidon, his second child; nor that, when Zeus was born next, his mother Rhea concealed
him, and when Kronos asked for him that he might devour him, gave him a stone
instead; nor that this, when it was devoured, pressed those who had been previously devoured,
and forced them out, so that Pluto, who was devoured first, came out first, and after him
Poseidon, and then Zeus;1056 nor that Zeus, as the story goes, preserved by the wit of his
mother, ascended into heaven, and spoiled his father of the kingdom; nor that he punished
his father’s brothers; nor that he came down to lust after mortal women; nor that he associated
with his sisters, and daughters, and sisters-in-law, and was guilty of shameful pæderasty;
nor that he devoured his daughter Metis, in order that from her he might make Athene be
born out of his own brain (and from his thigh might bear Dionysos, who is said to have
been rent in pieces by the Titans)1057; nor that he held a feast at the marriage of Peleus and
Thetis;1058 nor that he excluded Eris (discord) from the marriage; nor that Eris on her part,
thus dishonoured, contrived an occasion of quarrelling and discord among the feasters; nor
that she took a golden apple from the gardens of the Hesperides, and wrote on it ‘For the
fair.’ And then they fable how Hera, and Athena, and Aphrodite, found the apple, and
quarrelling about it, came to Zeus; and he did not decide it for them, but sent them by
Hermes to the shepherd Paris, to be judged of their beauty. But there was no such judging
of the goddesses; nor did Paris give the apple to Aphrodite; nor did Aphrodite, being thus
honoured, honour him in return, by giving him Helen to wife. For the honour bestowed
by the goddess could never have furnished a pretext for a universal war, and that to the ruin

<p>“There was once a time when nothing existed but chaos and a confused mixture of orderless
elements, which were as yet simply heaped together.1059 This nature testifies, and
great men have been of opinion that it was so. Of these great men I shall bring forward to
you him who excelled them all in wisdom, Homer, where he says, with a reference to the
original confused mass, ‘But may you all become water and earth;’1060 implying that from
these all things had their origin, and that all things return to their first state, which is chaos,
when the watery and earthy substances are separated. And Hesiod in the Theogony says,
‘Assuredly chaos was the very first to come into being.’1061 Now, by ‘come into being,’ he
evidently means that chaos came into being, as having a beginning, and did not always exist,
without beginning. And Orpheus likens chaos to an egg, in which was the confused mixture
of the primordial elements. This chaos, which Orpheus calls an egg, is taken for granted by
Hesiod, having a beginning, produced from infinite matter, and originated in the following
way.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Origin of Chaos.</head>
<p>“This matter, of four kinds, and endowed with life, was an entire infinite abyss, so to
speak, in eternal stream, borne about without order, and forming every now and then
countless but ineffectual combinations (which therefore it dissolved again from want of
order); ripe indeed, but not able to be bound so as to generate a living creature. And once
it chanced that this infinite sea, which was thus by its own nature driven about with a natural
motion, flowed in an orderly manner from the same to the same (back on itself), like a
whirlpool, mixing the substances in such a way that from each1062 there flowed down the
middle of the universe (as in the funnel of a mould) precisely that which was most useful
and suitable for the generation of a living creature. This was carried down by the all-carrying
whirlpool, drew to itself the surrounding spirit, and having been so conceived that it was
very fertile, formed a separate substance. For just as a bubble is usually formed in water, so
everything round about contributed to the conception of this ball-like globe. Then there
came forth to the light, after it had been conceived in itself, and was borne upwards by the
divine spirit which surrounded it,1063 perhaps the greatest thing ever born; a piece of
workmanship, so to speak, having life in it which had been conceived from that entire infinite
abyss, in shape like an egg, and as swift as a bird.</p>

<p>“Now you must think of Kronos as time (chronos), and Rhea as the flowing (rheon) of
the watery substance.1064 For the whole body of matter was borne about for some Time,
before it brought forth, like an egg, the sphere-like, all-embracing heaven (ouranos), which
at first was full of productive marrow, so that it was able to produce out of itself elements
and colours of all sorts, while from the one substance and the one colour it produced all
kinds of forms. For as a peacock’s egg seems to have only one colour, while potentially it
has in it all the colours of the animal that is to be, so this living egg, conceived out of infinite
matter, when set in motion by the underlying and ever-flowing matter, produces many
different forms. For within the circumference a certain living creature, which is both male
and female, is formed by the skill of the indwelling divine spirit. This Orpheus calls Phanes,
because when it appeared (phaneis) the universe shone forth from it, with the lustre of that
most glorious of the elements, fire, perfected in moisture. Nor is this incredible, since in
glowworms nature gives us to see a moist light.</p>

And so by the mighty power of that which appeared (phaneis) and came forth, the globe
attained coherency, and maintained order, while it itself took its seat, as it were, on the
summit of heaven, there in ineffable mystery diffusing light through endless ages. But the
productive matter left inside the globe, separated the substances of all things. For first its
lower part, just like the dregs, sank downwards of its own weight; and this they called Pluto
from its gravity, and weight, and great quantity (polu) of underlying matter, styling it the
king of Hades and the dead.1067</p>

meaning that it sank downwards. And the water which flowed together after this first sediment,
and floated on the surface of the first substance, they called Poseidon. And then what
remained, the purest and noblest of all, for it was translucent fire, they called Zeus, from its
glowing (zeousa) nature. Now since fire ascends, this was not swallowed, and made to
descend by time or Kronos; but, as I said, the fiery substance, since it has life in it, and naturally
ascends, flew right up into the air, which from its purity is very intelligent. By his
own proper heat, then, Zeus—that is, the glowing substance—draws up what is left in the

wisdom, by which the ætherial artificer wrought out the whole world. And from all-pervading
Zeus, that is, from this very hot æther, air (aer) extends all the way to our earth; and this
they call Hera. Wherefore, because it has come below the æther, which is the purest substance
(just as a woman, as regards purity, is inferior), when the two were compared to see which

not bear anything on account of the extreme cold. And that troubled and drunken composition
which arises from the upper and lower vapours they called Dionysus, as troubling the
intellect. And the water under the earth, which is in nature indeed one, but which flows
through all the paths of earth, and is divided into many parts, they called Osiris, as being
cut in pieces. And they understand Adonis as favourable seasons, Aphrodite as coition and

as completing the period of a year. And these said transformations of the all-pervading
Zeus must be regarded as the numerous changes of the seasons, while his numberless wives
you must understand to be years, or generations. For the power which proceeds from the
æther and passes through the air unites with all the years and generations in turn, and
continually varies them, and so produces or destroys the crops. And ripe fruits are called

marrow-like matter; and I shall briefly run over the description of what took place in it by
the agency of this matter, with all that followed. For from Kronos and Rhea were born, as
you say—that is, by time and matter—first Pluto, who represents the sediment which settled
down; and then Poseidon, the liquid substance in the middle,1071 which floated over the
heavier body below; and the third child—that is, Zeus—is the æther, and is highest of all.

prime of life, reason, that shepherd of the soul, is brutish, does not regard its own advantage,
will have nothing to do with manliness and temperance, chooses only pleasure, and gives
the prize to lust alone, bargaining that it is to receive in return from lust what may delight
it,—he who thus judges incorrectly will choose pleasure to his own destruction and that of
his friends. And Eris is jealous spite; and the golden apples of the Hesperides are perhaps
riches, by which occasionally even temperate persons like Hera are seduced, and manly ones

those who wish these stories to be believed, in order that they may not be ashamed when
they do the like. If they had been disposed to act reverently, they ought, as I said a little ago,
even if the gods really did the things which are sung of them, to have veiled their indecencies
under more seemly stories, and not, on the contrary, as you say they did, when the deeds
of the gods were honourable, clothed them in wicked and indecent forms, which, even when
interpreted, can only be understood by much labour; and when they were understood by
some, they indeed got for their much toil the privilege of not being deceived, which they
might have had without the toil, while they who were deceived were utterly ruined. (Those,
however, who trace the allegories to a more honourable source I do not object to; as, for
instance, those who explain one allegory by saying that it was wisdom which sprang from
the head of Zeus.) On the whole, it seems to me more probable that wicked men, robbing
the gods of their honour, ventured to promulgate these insulting stories.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—None of These Allegories are Consistent.</head>
<p>“Nor do we find the poetical allegory about any of the gods consistent with itself. To
go no further than the fashioning of the universe, the poets now say that nature was the first
cause of the whole creation, now that it was mind. For, say they, the first moving and mixture
of the elements came from nature, but it was the foresight of mind which arranged them in
order. Even when they assert that it was nature which fashioned the universe, being unable
absolutely to demonstrate this on account of the traces of design in the work, they in weave
the foresight of mind in such a way that they are able to entrap even the wisest. But we say
to them: If the world arose from self-moved nature, how did it ever take proportion and
shape, which cannot come but from a superintending wisdom, and can be comprehended
only by knowledge, which alone can trace such things? If, on the other hand, it is by wisdom
that all things subsist and maintain order, how can it be that those things arose from selfmoved
chance?</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—These Gods Were Really Wicked Magicians.</head>
<p>“Then those who chose to make dishonourable allegories of divine things—as, for instance,
that Metis was devoured by Zeus—have fallen into a dilemma, because they did not
see that they who in these stories about the gods indirectly taught physics, denied the very
existence of the gods, revolving all kinds of gods into mere allegorical representations of
the various substances of the universe. And so it is more likely that the gods these persons
celebrate were some sort of wicked magicians, who were in reality wicked men, but by magic
assumed different shapes, committed adulteries, and took away life, and thus to the men of
old who did not understand magic seemed to be gods by the things they did; and the bodies

the tomb of a certain Kronos, a man, and a fierce monarch who slew his children. And the
son of this man, called Zeus, became worse than his father; and having by the power of
magic been declared ruler of the universe, he committed many adulteries, and inflicted
punishment on his father and uncles, and so died; and the Cretans show his tomb. And in
Mesopotamia there lie buried a certain Helios at Atir, and a certain Selene at Carrhæ. A
certain Hermes, a man, lies buried in Egypt; Ares in Thrace; Aphrodite in Cyprus; Æsculapius
in Epidaurus; and the tombs of many other such persons are to be seen.1077</p>

wonder that they who lived in the times of Æsculapius and Hercules were deceived, or the

before his death. And this truly is a small impiety, that the Egyptians give divine honours
to a man in his lifetime; but what is of all things most absurd is, that they worship birds and
creeping things, and all kinds of beasts. For the mass of men neither think nor do anything
with discretion. But look, I pray you, at what is most disgraceful of all: he who is with them
the father of gods and men is said by them to have had intercourse with Leda; and many of
them set up in public a painting of this, writing above it the name Zeus. To punish this insult,
I could wish that they would paint their own present king in such base embraces as they
have dared to do with Zeus, and set it up in public, that from the anger of a temporary
monarch, and him a mortal, they might learn to render honour where it is due. This I say
to you, not as myself already knowing the true God; but I am happy to say that even if I do

Nor can that mixing be God, nor that compounding, nor that generating, nor that globe
which surrounds the visible universe; nor the dregs which flow together in Hades, nor the
water which floats over them; nor the fiery substance, nor the air which extends from it to
our earth. For the four elements, if they lay outside one another, could not have been mixed
together so as to generate animal life without some great artificer. If they have always been
united, even in this case they are fitted together by an artistic mind to what is requisite for
the limbs and parts of animals, that they may be able to preserve their respective proportions,
may have a clearly defined shape, and that all the inward parts may attain the fitting coherency.
In the same way also the positions suitable for each are determined, and that very
beautifully, by the artificer mind. To be brief, in all other things which a living creature
must have, this great being of the world is in no respect wanting.</p>

<p>“Thus we are shut up to the supposition that there is an unbegotten artificer, who brought
the elements together, if they were separate; or, if they were together, artistically blended
them so as to generate life, and perfected from all one work. For it cannot be that a work
which is completely wise can be made without a mind which is greater than it. Nor will it
do to say that love is the artificer of all things, or desire, or power, or any such thing. All
these are liable to change, and transient in their very nature. Nor can that be God which is
moved by another, much less what is altered by time and nature, and can be annihilated.”1079</p>

<p>“God, who created the heavens and the whole universe, does not want occasion for the

Him with unkindness to man. For men do not know the issue of those things which happen
to them, nay, suspect that the result will be evil; but God knows that they will turn out well.
So is it in the case of Simon. He is a power of the left hand of God, and has authority to do
harm to those who know not God, so that he has been able to involve you in diseases; but
by these very diseases, which have been permitted to come upon you by the good providence
of God, you, seeking and finding him who is able to cure, have been compelled to submit
to the will of God on the occasion of the cure of the body, and to think of believing, in order

these sicknesses, unwittingly drawing upon yourselves with your own hands the sword of
destruction. For the demons would never have had power over you, had not you first supped
with their prince. For thus from the beginning was a law laid by God, the Creator of all
things, on each of the two princes, him of the right hand and him of the left, that neither
should have power over any one whom they might wish to benefit or to hurt, unless first
he had sat down at the same table with them. As, then, when you partook of meat offered
to idols, you became servants to the prince of evil, in like manner, if you cease from these
things, and flee for refuge to God through the good Prince of His right hand, honouring
Him without sacrifices, by doing whatsoever He wills, know of a truth that not only will
your bodies be healed, but your souls also will become healthy. For He only, destroying

submit to those things which are well-pleasing to God, you may get new strength to your
bodies, and recover your soul’s health. And the things which are well-pleasing to God are
these: to pray to Him, to ask from Him, recognising that He is the giver of all things, and
gives with discriminating law; to abstain from the table of devils, not to taste dead flesh, not
to touch blood; to be washed from all pollution; and the rest in one word,—as the Godfearing
Jews have heard, do you also hear, and be of one mind in many bodies; let each man
be minded to do to his neighbour those good things he wishes for himself. And you may
all find out what is good, by holding some such conversation as the following with yourselves:
You would not like to be murdered; do not murder another man: you would not like your
wife to be seduced by another; do not you commit adultery: you would not like any of your
things to be stolen from you; steal nothing from another. And so understanding by yourselves
what is reasonable, and doing it, you will become dear to God, and will obtain healing;
otherwise in the life which now is your bodies will be tormented, and in that which is to
come your souls will be punished.”1081</p>

being guided of God. The path of the lost, then, is broad and very smooth—it ruins them
without troubling them; but the path of the saved is narrow, rugged, and in the end it saves,
not without much toil, those who have journeyed through it. And these two paths are
presided over by unbelief and faith; and these journey through the path of unbelief, those
who have preferred pleasure, on account of which they have forgotten the day of judgment,
doing that which is not pleasing to God, and not caring to save their souls by the word, and
have not anxiously sought their own good. Truly they know not that the counsels of God
are not like men’s counsels; for, in the first place, He knows the thoughts of all men, and all
must give an account not only of their actions, but also of their thoughts. And their sin is
much less who strive to understand well and fall, than that of those who do not at all strive
after good things. Because it has pleased God that he who errs in his knowledge of good,
as men count errors, should be saved after being slightly punished. But they who have taken
no care at all to know the better way, even though they may have done countless other good
deeds, if they have not stood in the service He has Himself appointed, come under the charge
of indifference, and are severely punished, and utterly destroyed.</p>

Peter, as one who could do things above human power. But as soon as the people gave him
a moment’s quiet, Peter with surprising boldness gave a little laugh, and said, “Friends, I

<p>“For on this account Jesus is concealed from the Jews, who have taken Moses as their
teacher, and Moses is hidden from those who have believed Jesus. For, there being one
teaching by both, God accepts him who has believed either of these. But believing a teacher
is for the sake of doing the things spoken by God. And that this is so our Lord Himself says,
‘I thank thee, Father of heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these things from
the wise and elder, and hast revealed them to sucking babes.’1093 Thus God Himself has
concealed a teacher from some, as foreknowing what they ought to do, and has revealed
him to others, who are ignorant what they ought to do.</p>

condemned, who know not Moses on account of Him who hath concealed him, provided
that these also, doing the things spoken by Jesus, do not hate Him whom they do not know.
And some will not be profited by calling the teachers lords, but not doing the works of servants.
For on this account our Jesus Himself said to one who often called Him Lord, but
did none of the things which He prescribed, ‘Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the
things which I say?’1094 For it is not saying that will profit any one, but doing. By all means,
therefore, is there need of good works. Moreover, if any one has been thought worthy to

acted ungratefully towards Him, and might subject every one to adequate punishment.
When, therefore, their petition was granted, they metamorphosed themselves into every
nature; for, being of a more godlike substance, they are able easily to assume any form. So
they became precious stones, and goodly pearl, and the most beauteous purple, and choice
gold, and all matter that is held in most esteem. And they fell into the hands of some, and
into the bosoms of others, and suffered themselves to be stolen by them. They also changed

when at the end of all things the demon is first consigned to the purifying fire, the soul which
is mixed with it is under the necessity of being horribly punished, and the demon of being
pleased. For the soul, being made of light, and not capable of bearing the heterogeneous
flame of fire, is tortured; but the demon, being in the substance of his own kind, is greatly
pleased, becoming the strong chain of the soul that he has swallowed up.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—How They are to Be Expelled.</head>
<p>“But the reason why the demons delight in entering into men’s bodies is this. Being
spirits, and having desires after meats and drinks, and sexual pleasures, but not being able
to partake of these by reason of their being spirits, and wanting organs fitted for their enjoyment,
they enter into the bodies of men, in order that, getting organs to minister to them,
they may obtain the things that they wish, whether it be meat, by means of men’s teeth, or
sexual pleasure, by means of men’s members. Hence, in order to the putting of demons to
flight, the most useful help is abstinence, and fasting, and suffering of affliction. For if they
enter into men’s bodies for the sake of sharing pleasures, it is manifest that they are put to
flight by suffering. But inasmuch as some,1114 being of a more malignant kind, remain by
the body that is undergoing punishment, though they are punished with it, therefore it is
needful to have recourse to God by prayers and petitions, refraining from every occasion
of impurity, that the hand of God may touch him for his cure, as being pure and faithful.</p>
<note type="footnote">1114 The gender is here changed, but the sense shows that the reference is still to the demons. I suppose the

<head>Chapter XI.—Unbelief the Demon’s Stronghold.</head>
<p>“But it is necessary in our prayers to acknowledge that we have had recourse to God,
and to bear witness, not to the apathy, but to the slowness of the demon. For all things are
done to the believer, nothing to the unbeliever. Therefore the demons themselves, knowing
the amount of faith of those of whom they take possession, measure their stay proportionately.
Wherefore they stay permanently with the unbelieving, tarry for a while with the
weak in faith; but with those who thoroughly believe, and who do good, they cannot remain
even for a moment. For the soul being turned by faith, as it were, into the nature of water,
quenches the demon as a spark of fire. The labour, therefore, of every one is to be solicitous
about the putting to flight of his own demon. For, being mixed up with men’s souls, they
suggest to every one’s mind desires after what things they please, in order that he may neglect
his salvation.</p>

<p>“Whence many, not knowing how they are influenced, consent to the evil thoughts
suggested by the demons, as if they were the reasoning of their own souls. Wherefore they
become less active to come to those who are able to save them, and do not know that they
themselves are held captive by the deceiving demons. Therefore the demons who lurk in
their souls induce them to think that it is not a demon that is distressing them, but a bodily
disease, such as some acrid matter, or bile, or phlegm, or excess of blood, or inflammation
of a membrane, or something else. But even if this were so, the case would not be altered
of its being a kind of demon. For the universal and earthly soul, which enters on account
of all kinds of food, being taken to excess by over-much food, is itself united to the spirit,
as being cognate, which is the soul of man; and the material part of the food being united
to the body, is left as a dreadful poison to it. Wherefore in all respects moderation is excellent.</p>

by means of anger, love, or some other affection, they suddenly injure the body, by sword,
or halter, or precipice, or something else, and at last bring to punishment the deceived souls
of those who have been mixed up with them, as we said, withdrawing into the purifying
fire. But others, who are deceived in another way, do not approach us, being seduced by
the instigations of maleficent demons, as if they suffered these things at the hands of the
gods themselves, on account of their neglect of them, and were able to reconcile them by
sacrifices, and that it is not needful to come to us, but rather to flee from and hate us. And

appearing in such forms as they please. And sometimes they prescribe remedies for those
who are diseased, and thus they receive divine honours from those who have previously
been deceived. And they conceal from many that they are demons, but not from us, who
know their mystery, and why they do these things, changing themselves in dreams against

of food and drink, changing themselves in dreams according to the forms of the images,
that they may increase error. For the image is neither a living creature, nor has it a divine
spirit, but the demon that appeared abused the form.1116 How many, in like manner, have
been seen by others in dreams; and when they have met one another when awake, and
compared them with what they saw in their dream, they have not accorded: so that the
dream is not a manifestation, but is either the production of a demon or of the soul, giving
forms to present fears and desire. For the soul, being struck with fear, conceives forms in
dreams. But if you think that images, as being alive, can accomplish such things, place them
on a beam accurately balanced, and place an equipoise in the other scale, then ask them to
become either heavier or lighter: and if this be done, then they are alive. But it does not so
happen. But if it were so, this would not prove them to be gods. For this might be accomplished
by the finger of the demon. Even maggots move, yet they are not called gods.</p>

forecasting future things? This also is false. But suppose it were true, this does not prove
them to be gods; for it does not follow, if anything prophesies, that it is a god. For pythons
prophesy, yet they are cast out by us as demons, and put to flight. But some one will say,
They work cures for some persons. It is false. But suppose it were true, this is no proof of
Godhead; for physicians also heal many, yet are not gods. But, says one, physicians do not
completely heal those of whom they take charge, but these heal oracularly. But the demons
know the remedies that are suited to each disease. Wherefore, being skilful physicians, and
able to cure those diseases which can be cured by men, and also being prophets, and
knowing when each disease is healed of itself, they so arrange their remedies that they may
gain the credit of producing the cure.</p>

almighty, do they not effect cures without administering any medicine? And for what
reason do they prescribe remedies to some of those who pray to them, while to some, and
it may be more suitable cases, they give no response? Thus, whenever a cure is going to take
place spontaneously, they promise, in order that they may get the credit of the cure; and
others, having been sick, and having prayed, and having recovered spontaneously, attributed
the cure to those whom they had invoked, and make offerings to them. Those, however,
who, after praying, have failed, are not able to offer their sacrifices. But if the relatives of
the dead, or any of their children, inquired into the losses, you would find the failures to be
more than the successes. But no one who has been taken in by them is willing to exhibit an
accusation against them, through shame or fear; but, on the other hand, they conceal the

For as many captains, with whole camps and cities, fear Cæsar, who is but a man, every

Thus also the Divine Holy Spirit rejoices because man hath overcome death; for the putting
of the demons to flight makes for the safety of another. But this we say, not as denying that
we ought to help others, but that we ought not to be inflated by this and neglect ourselves.
It happens, also, that the demons flee before some wicked men by reason of the honoured
name, and both he who expels the demon and he who witnesses it are deceived: he who
expels him, as if he were honoured on account of righteousness, not knowing the wickedness
of the demon. For he has at once honoured the name, and by his flight has brought the
wicked man into a thought of his righteousness, and so deceived him away from repentance.
But the looker-on, associating with the expeller as a pious man, hastens to a like manner of
life, and is ruined. Sometimes also they pretend to flee before adjurations not made in the

therefore they do not desire it; for what they do not know, they cannot love. But those who

it, you must of necessity know that it is not lawful to give the name of Cæsar to another,
whether he be consul, or prefect, or captain, or any one else, and that he who gives such a
name shall not live, and he who takes it shall be cut off. Thus, according to your own illustration,
the name of God must not be given to another; and he who is tempted either to take
or give it is destroyed. Now, if this insult of a man induces punishment, much more they
who call others gods shall be subject to eternal punishment, as insulting God. And with
good reason; because you subject to all the insult that you can the name which it was committed
to you to honour, in order to His monarchy. For God is not properly His name; but
you having in the meantime received it, insult what has been given you, that it may be accounted

<head>Chapter XV.—Heathen Worshippers Under the Power of the Demon.</head>
<p>“And why do ye take pleasure in these doings? Since the serpent which lurks in you,
which has sown in you fruitless lust, will not tell you, I shall speak and put it on record.
Thus the case stands. According to the worship of God, the proclamation is made to be
sober, to be chaste, to restrain passion, not to pilfer other men’s goods, to live uprightly,
moderately, fearlessly, gently; rather to restrain one’s self in necessities, than to supply his
wants by wrongfully taking away the property of another. But with the so-called gods the
reverse is done. And ye renounce some things as done by you, in order to the admiration
of your righteousness; whereas, although you did all that you are commanded, ignorance
with respect to God is alone sufficient for your condemnation. But meeting together in the
places which you have dedicated to them, you delight in making yourselves drunk, and you
kindle your altars, of which the diffused odour through its influence attracts the blind and
deaf spirits to the place of their fumigation. And thus, of those who are present, some are
filled with inspirations, and some with strange fiends, and some betake themselves to lasciviousness,
and some to theft and murder. For the exhalation of blood, and the libation of
wine, satisfies even these unclean spirits, which lurk within you and cause you to take
pleasure in the things that are transacted there, and in dreams surround you with false
phantasies, and punish you with myriads of diseases. For under the show of the so-called
sacred victims you are filled with dire demons, which, cunningly concealing themselves,
destroy you, so that you should not understand the plot that is laid for you. For, under the
guise of some injury, or love, or anger, or grief, or strangling you with a rope, or drowning
you, or throwing you from a precipice, or by suicide, or apoplexy, or some other disease,
they deprive you of life.</p>

<p>“But no one of us can suffer such a thing; but they themselves are punished by us, when,
having entered into any one, they entreat us that they may go out slowly. But some one will
say perhaps, Even some of the worshippers of God fall under such sufferings. I say that is
impossible. For he is a worshipper of God, of whom I speak, who is truly pious, not one
who is such only in name, but who really performs the deeds of the law that has been given
him. If any one acts impiously, he is not pious; in like manner as, if he who is of another
tribe keeps the law, he is a Jew; but he who does not keep it is a Greek. For the Jew believes
God and keeps the law, by which faith he removes also other sufferings, though like mountains
and heavy.1130 But he who keeps not the law is manifestly a deserter through not believing
God; and thus as no Jew, but a sinner, he is on account of his sin brought into subjection
to those sufferings which are ordained for the punishment of sinners. For, by the
will of God prescribed at the beginning, punishment righteously follows those who worship
Him on account of transgressions; and this is so, in order that having reckoned with them
by punishment for sin as for a debt, he may set forth those who have turned to Him pure
in the universal judgment. For as the wicked here enjoy luxury to the loss of eternal blessings,
so punishments are sent upon the Jews who transgress for a settlement of accounts, that,
expiating their transgression here, they may there be set free from eternal punishments.</p>

wrath against the seducer, which is likened to a sword,1132 and by holding forth the word
he destroys ignorance by knowledge, cutting, as it were, and separating the living from the
dead. Therefore, while wickedness is being conquered by lawful knowledge, war has taken
hold of all. For the submissive son is, for the sake of salvation, separated from the unbelieving
father, or the father from the son, or the mother from the daughter, or the daughter from

with them, and, after profiting them nothing, were also destroyed along with them, how is
it not just that he who wishes to be saved should be separated from him who will not, but
who wishes to destroy him along with himself. Moreover, it is not those who judge better
that wish to be separated, but they wish to stay with them, and to profit them by the exposition
of better things; and therefore the unbelievers, not wishing to hearken to them, make
war against them, banishing, persecuting, hating them. But those who suffer these things,
pitying those who are ensnared by ignorance, by the teaching of wisdom pray for those who
contrive evil against them, having learned that ignorance is the cause of their sin. For the
Teacher Himself, being nailed to the cross, prayed to the Father that the sin of those who
slew Him might be forgiven, saying, ‘Father, forgive them their sins, for they know not what
they do.’1133 They also therefore, being imitators of the Teacher in their sufferings, pray
for those who contrive them, as they have been taught. Therefore they are not separated as
hating their parents, since they make constant prayers even for those who are neither parents
nor relatives, but enemies, and strive to love them, as they have been commanded.</p>

which is of lust, and thus you are able to obtain salvation. But otherwise it is impossible.
For thus the prophet has sworn to us, saying, “Verily I say to you, Unless ye be regenerated
by living water into the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you shall not enter the kingdom
of heaven.”1134 Wherefore approach. For there is there something that is merciful from

are baptized with the thrice blessed invocation, offering as gifts to God the good deeds of
the baptized whenever they are done after their baptism. Wherefore flee to the waters, for

delay brings danger, on account of the fore-appointment of death being unrevealed; and

<p>“However, it is necessary to add something to these things which has not community
with man, but is peculiar to the worship of God. I mean purification, not approaching to
a man’s own wife when she is in separation, for so the law of God commands. But what?
If purity be not added to the service of God, you would roll pleasantly like the dung-flies.
Wherefore as man, having something more than the irrational animals, namely, rationality,
purify your hearts from evil by heavenly reasoning, and wash your bodies in the bath. For
purification according to the truth is not that the purity of the body precedes purification
after the heart, but that purity follows goodness. For our Teacher also, dealing with certain
of the Pharisees and Scribes among us, who are separated, and as Scribes know the matters
of the law more than others, still He reproved them as hypocrites, because they cleansed
only the things that appear to men, but omitted purity of heart and the things seen by God
alone.</p>

<p>“Therefore He made use of this memorable expression, speaking the truth with respect
to the hypocrites of them, not with respect to all. For to some He said that obedience was
to be rendered, because they were entrusted with the chair of Moses. However, to the hypocrites
he said, ‘Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside
of the cup and the platter, but the inside is full of filth. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first
the inside of the cup and the platter, that their outsides may be clean also.’ And truly: for
when the mind is enlightened by knowledge, the disciple is able to be good, and thereupon
purity follows; for from the understanding within a good care of the body without is produced.
As from negligence with respect to the body, care of the understanding cannot be
produced, so the pure man can purify both that which is without and that which is within.
And he who, purifying the things without, does it looking to the praise of men, and by the
praise of those who look on, he has nothing from God.</p>

purity when you served senseless idols; and be ashamed that now, when it is necessary to

has taught us, saying to those who neglected to come and listen to Him, ‘The queen of the
south shall rise up with this generation, and shall condemn it; because she came from the
extremities of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon: and behold, a greater than Solomon
is here,’1136 and ye do not believe Him. And to those amongst the people who would not
repent at His preaching He said, ‘The men of Nineveh shall rise up with this generation and
shall condemn it, for they heard and repented on the preaching of Jonas: and behold, a
greater is here, and no one believes.’1137 And thus, setting over against all their impiety
those from among the Gentiles who have done well, in order to condemn those who, possessing
the true religion, had not acted so well as those who were in error, he exhorted those
having reason not only to do equally with the Gentiles whatsoever things are excellent, but
more than they. And this speech has been suggested to me, taking occasion from the necessity
of respecting the separation, and of washing after copulation, and of not denying such purity,
though those who are in error do the same, since those who in error do well, without being
saved, are for the condemnation of those who are in the worship of God, and do ill; because
their respect for purity is through error, and not through the worship of the true Father and
God of all.”</p>

<p>When, therefore, they had gone, I, Clement, rejoiced greatly that he had ordered me to
remain with himself. Then I answered and said, “I thank God that you have not sent me
away as you have done the others, as I should have died of grief.” But he said, “But what?
If there shall ever be any necessity that you be sent away for the sake of teaching, would you,
on account of being separated for a little while from me, and that for an advantageous purpose,
would you die for that? Would you not rather impress upon yourself the duty of
bearing the things that are arranged for you through necessity, and cheerfully submit? And
do you not know that friends are present with one another in their memories, although they
are separated bodily; whereas some, being bodily present, wander from their friends in their

<p>Then I answered, “Do not think, my lord, that I should endure that grief foolishly, but
with some good reason. For since I hold you, my lord, in place of all, father, mother,
brothers, relatives, you who are the means through God of my having the saving truth,
holding you in place of all, I have the greatest consolation. And in addition to this, being
afraid of my natural youthful lust, I was concerned lest, being left by you (being but a young
man, and having now such a resolution that it would be impossible to desert you without
incurring the anger of God,)1143 I should be overcome by lust. But since it is much better
and safer for me to remain with you, when my mind is with good reason set upon venerating,
therefore I pray that I may always remain with you. Moreover, I remember you saying in
Cæsarea, ‘If any one wishes to journey with me, let him piously journey.’ And by piously
you meant, that those who are devoted to the worship of God should grieve no one in respect
of God, such as by leaving parents, an attached wife, or any others.1144 Whence I am in all
respects a fitting fellow-traveller for you, to whom, if you would confer the greatest favour,
you would allow to perform the functions of a servant.”</p>

take care of those many splendid tunics, with all my changes of rings and sandals? And
who shall make ready those pleasant and artistic dainties, which, being so various, need
many skilful cooks, and all those things which are procured with great eagerness, and are
prepared for the appetite of effeminate men as for some great wild beast? However, such a
choice has occurred to you, perhaps, without you understanding or knowing my manner
of life, that I use only bread and olives, and rarely pot-herbs; and that this is my only coat
and cloak which I wear; and I have no need of any of them, nor of aught else: for even in
these I abound. For my mind, seeing all the eternal good things that are there, regards none
of the things that are here. However, I accept of your good will; and I admire and commend
you, for that you, a man of refined habits, have so easily submitted your manner of living
to your necessities. For we, from our childhood, both I and Andrew, my brother, who is
also my brother as respects God, not only being brought up in the condition of orphans,
but also accustomed to labour through poverty and misfortune, easily bear the discomforts
of our present journeys. Whence, if you would obey me, you would allow me, a working

piety. But he, seeing me weeping, asked the cause of my tears. Then I said, “In what have
I sinned so that you have spoken to me such a word?” Then Peter answered, “If it were
wrong of me to speak of being your servant, you were first in fault in asking to be mine.”
Then I said, “The cases are not parallel; for to do this indeed becomes me well; but it is terrible
for you, the herald of God, and who savest our souls, to do this to me.” Then Peter answered,
“I should agree with you, but that1145 our Lord, who came for the salvation of all the world,
being alone noble above all, submitted to the condition of a servant, that He might persuade
us not to be ashamed to perform the ministrations of servants to our brethren, however

“There are indeed many and great men, being of the kindred of Cæsar. Wherefore Cæsar
himself gave a wife of his own family to my father, who was his foster-brother; and of her
three sons of us were born, two before me, who were twins and very like each other, as my
father told me. But I scarcely know either them or our mother, but bear about with me an
obscure image of them, as through dreams. My mother’s name was Mattidia, and my father’s,
Faustus; and of my brothers one was called Faustinus, and the other Faustinianus.1146 Then
after I, their third son, was born, my mother saw a vision—so my father told me—which
told her, that unless she immediately took away her twin sons, and left the city of Rome for
exile for twelve years, she and they must die by an all-destructive fate.</p>

very thankful, that the vision had not ordered me also to depart with my mother from the
city of Rome. Then, after the lapse of a year, my father sent money to them to Athens, and
at the same time to learn how they did. But those who went on this errand did not return.
And in the third year, my father being distressed, sent others in like manner with supplies,

inquire of many where any one of them had seen or heard of a shipwreck four years ago.
And one turned one place, and another another. Then he inquired whether they had seen
the body of a woman with two children cast ashore. And when they told him they had seen
many corpses. in many places, my father groaned at the information. But, with his bowels
yearning, he asked unreasonable questions, that he might try to search so great an extent of
sea. However, he was pardonable, because, through affection towards those whom he was
seeking for, he fed on vain hopes. And at last, placing me under guardians, and leaving me
at Rome when I was twelve years old, he himself, weeping, went down to the harbour, and
went on board ship, and set out upon the search. And from that day till this I have neither
received a letter from him, nor do I know whether he be alive or dead. But I rather suspect
that he is dead somewhere, either overcome by grief, or perished by shipwreck. And the

father hath suffered, he would immediately have assigned the cause of it to be his worship
of God, ascribing it to the wicked one. Thus also it is the lot of the wretched Gentiles to
suffer; and we worshippers of God know it not. But with good reason I call them wretched,
because here they are ensnared, and the hope that is thine they obtain not. For those who
in the worship of God suffer afflictions, suffer them for the expiation of their transgressions.”</p>

<p>When Peter had spoken thus, a certain one amongst us ventured to invite him, in the

distant, I suppose, not quite thirty stadia, for the purpose of seeing two pillars of vine-wood
that were there, and that were of very great girth. Therefore the indulgent Peter consented,
saying, “When you leave the boat, do not go many of you together to see the things that you
desire to see; for I do not wish that the attention of the inhabitants should be turned to you.”
And so we sailed, and in short time arrived at the island. Then landing from the boat, we
went to the place where the vine-wood pillars were, and along with them we looked at several

noticing a certain woman sitting outside before the doors, begging constantly for her support,
he said to her, “O woman, is any of your limbs defective, that you submit to such disgrace—I
mean that of begging,—and do not rather work with the hands which God has given you,
and procure your daily food?” But she, groaning, answered, “Would that I had hands able
to work! But now they retain only the form of hands, being dead and rendered useless by
my gnawing of them.” Then Peter asked her, “What is the cause of your suffering so terribly?”
And she answered, “Weakness of soul; and nought else. For if I had the mind of a
man, there was a precipice or a pool whence I should have thrown myself, and have been
able to rest from my tormenting misfortunes.”</p>

persuaded that souls are really found alive in Hades; then I should love death, making light
of the punishment, that I might see, were it but for an hour, my longed for sons!” Then said
Peter, “What is it that grieves you? I should like to know, O woman. For if you inform me,

<p>Then the woman, not understanding what was spoken ambiguously, being pleased with
the promise, began to speak thus:—“Were I to speak of my family and my country, I do not
suppose that I should be able to persuade any one. But of what consequence is it to you to
learn this, excepting only the reason why in my anguish I have deadened my hands by
gnawing them? Yet I shall give you an account of myself, so far as it is in your power to
hear it. I, being very nobly born, by the arrangement of a certain man in authority, became
the wife of a man who was related to him. And first I had twins sons, and afterwards another
son. But my husband’s brother, being thoroughly mad, was enamoured of wretched me,
who exceedingly affected chastity. And I, wishing neither to consent to my lover nor to
expose to my husband his brother’s love of me, reasoned thus: that I may neither defile
myself by the commission of adultery nor disgrace my husband’s bed, nor set brother at
war with brother, nor subject the whole family, which is a great one, to the reproach of all,
as I said. I reasoned that it was best for me to leave the city for some time with my twin
children, until the impure love should cease of him who flattered me to my disgrace. The
other son, however, I left with his father, to remain for a comfort to him.</p>

<p>“However, that matters might be thus arranged, I resolved to fabricate a dream, to the
effect that some one stood by me by night, and thus spoke: ‘O woman, straightway leave
the city with your twin children for some time, until I shall charge you to return hither again;
otherwise you forthwith shall die miserably, with your husband and all your children.’ And
so I did. For as soon as I told the false dream to my husband, he being alarmed, sent me off
by ship to Athens with my two sons, and with slaves, maids, and abundance of money, to
educate the boys, until, said he, it shall please the giver of the oracle that you return to me.
But, wretch that I am, while sailing with my children, I was driven by the fury of the winds
into these regions, and the ship having gone to pieces in the night, I was wrecked. And all
the rest having died, my unfortunate self alone was tossed by a great wave and cast upon a
rock; and while I sat upon it in my misery, I was prevented, by the hope of finding my children
alive, from throwing myself into the deep then, when I could easily have done it, having
my soul made drunk by the waves.</p>

seeking for the dead bodies of my hapless children. Therefore the inhabitants took pity on
me, and seeing me naked, they first clothed me and then sounded the deep, seeking for my
children. And when they found nothing of what they sought, some of the hospitable women
came to me to comfort me, and every one told her own misfortunes, that I might obtain
comfort from the occurrences of similar misfortunes. But this only grieved me the more
for I said that I was not so wicked that I could take comfort from the misfortunes of others.
And so, when many of them asked me to accept their hospitality, a certain poor woman
with much urgency constrained me to come into her cottage, saying to me, ‘Take courage,
woman, for my husband, who was a sailor, also died at sea, while he was still in the bloom
of his youth; and ever since, though many have asked me in marriage, I have preferred living
as a widow, regretting the loss of my husband. But we shall have in common whatever we

and the woman who had taken me in, being wholly seized by some malady, is confined in
the house. Since then the former compassion of the women has declined, and I and the
woman of the house are both of us helpless. For a long time I have sat here, as you see,
begging; and whatever I get I convey to my fellow-sufferer for our support. Let this suffice
about my affairs. For the rest, what hinders your fulfilling of your promise to give me the

<p>While the woman thus spoke, Peter seemed to be in suspense on account of many

And now, what is in hand?” But Peter ordered me to lead the way, and wait for him at the
boat; and because there was no gainsaying when he commanded, I did as I was ordered.
But Peter, as he afterwards related the whole matter to me, being struck in his heart with
some slight suspicion, inquired of the woman, saying, “Tell me, O woman, your family, and
your city, and the names of your children, and presently I shall give you the drug.” But she,
being put under constraint, and not wishing to speak, yet being eager to obtain the drug,
cunningly said one thing for another. And so she said that she was an Ephesian and her
husband a Sicilian; and in like manner she changed the names of the three children. Then
Peter, supposing that she spoke the truth, said, “Alas! O woman, I thought that this day was
to bring you great joy, suspecting that you are a certain person of whom I was thinking, and
whose affairs I have heard and accurately know.” But she adjured him, saying, “Tell me, I

the discourses on religion, a Roman citizen, who told me how that, having a father and two
twin brothers, he has lost sight of them all. For,” says he, “my mother, as my father related
to me, having seen a vision, left the city Rome for a time with her twin children, lest she
should perish by an evil fate, and having gone away with them, she cannot be found; and

herself, persuading her to confess what was the matter with her. But she, being powerless
in the rest of her body, as through intoxication, turned her head round, being able to sustain
the greatness of the hoped for joy, and rubbing her face: “Where,” said she, “is this youth?”
And he, now seeing through the whole affair, said, “Tell me first; for otherwise you cannot
see him.” Then she earnestly said, “I am that youth’s mother.” Then said Peter, “What is
his name?” And she said, “Clement.” Then Peter said, “It is the same, and he it was that
spoke to me a little while ago, whom I ordered to wait for me in the boat. And she, falling
at Peter’s feet, entreated him to make haste to come to the boat. Then Peter, “If you will
keep terms with me, I shall do so.” Then she said, “I will do anything; only show me my

him, to his honour. But as soon as I touched her hand, she gave a motherly shout, and

I kissed her. For as soon as this was told me, I in some way recalled her appearance indistinctly.
Then great crowds ran together to see the beggar woman, telling one another that
her son had recognised her, and that he was a man of consideration. Then, when we would
have straightway left the island with my mother, she said to us, “My much longed-for son,
it is right that I should bid farewell to the woman who entertained me, who, being poor and
wholly debilitated, lies in the house.” And Peter hearing this, and all the multitude who
stood by, admired the good disposition of the woman. And immediately Peter ordered
some persons to go and bring the woman on her couch. And as soon as the couch was
brought and set down, Peter said, in the hearing of the whole multitude, “If I be a herald of
the truth, in order to the faith of the bystanders, that they may know that there is one God,
who made the world, let her straightway rise whole.” And while Peter was still speaking,
the woman arose healed, and fell down before Peter, and kissed her dear associate, and asked
her what it all meant. Then she briefly detailed to her the whole business of the recognition,
1147 to the astonishment of the hearers. Then also my mother, seeing her hostess cured,
entreated that she herself also might obtain healing. And his placing his hand upon her,
cured her also.</p>

pertain to his salvation. For if you are familiar with leaving your country for the sake of
trading or of warfare, and coming to far-off places, you should not be unwilling to go three
days’ journey for the sake of eternal salvation.” Then, after the address of Peter, I presented
the woman who had been healed, in the presence of all the multitude, with a thousand
drachmas, for her support, giving her in charge to a certain good man, who was the chief
man of the city, and who of his own accord joyfully undertook the charge. Further, having
distributed money amongst many other women, and thanked those who at any time had
comforted my mother, I sailed away to Antaradus, along with my mother, and Peter, and

<head>Chapter XXV.—Philanthropy and Friendship.</head>
<p>And when we were arrived and had partaken of food, and given thanks according to
our custom, there being still time,1148 I said to Peter: “My lord Peter, my mother has done
a work of philanthropy in remembering the woman her hostess.” And Peter answered,
“Have you indeed, O Clement, thought truly that your mother did a work of philanthropy
in respect of her treatment of the woman who took her in after her shipwreck, or have you
spoken this word by way of greatly complimenting your mother? But if you spoke truly,
and not by way of compliment, you seem to me not to know what the greatness of philanthropy
is, which is affection towards any one whatever in respect of his being a man, apart
from physical persuasion. But not even do I venture to call the hostess who received your
mother after her shipwreck, philanthropic; for she was impelled by pity, and persuaded to
become the benefactress of a woman who had been shipwrecked, who was grieving for her
children,—a stranger, naked, destitute, and greatly deploring her misfortunes. When,
therefore, she was in such circumstances, who that saw her, though he were impious, could
but pity her? So that it does not seem to me that even the stranger-receiving woman did a
work of philanthropy, but to have been moved to assist her by pity for her innumerable
misfortunes. And how much more is it true of your mother, than when she was in prosperous
circumstances and requited her hostess, she did a deed, not of philanthropy, but of friendship!
for there is much difference between friendship and philanthropy, because friendship springs
from requital. But philanthropy, apart from physical persuasion, loves and benefits every
man as he is a man. If, therefore, while she pitied her hostess, she also pitied and did good
to her enemies who have wronged her, she would be philanthropic; but if, on one account
she is friendly or hostile, and on another account is hostile or friendly, such an one is the
friend or enemy of some quality, not of man as man.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—What is Philanthropy.</head>
<p>Then I answered, “Do you not think, then, that even the stranger-receiver was philanthropic,
who did good to a stranger whom she did not know?” Then Peter said, “Compassionate,
indeed, I can call her, but I dare not call her philanthropic, just as I cannot call a
mother philoteknic, for she is prevailed on to have an affection for them by her pangs, and
by her rearing of them. As the lover also is gratified by the company and enjoyment of his
mistress, and the friend by return of friendship, so also the compassionate man by misfortune.
However the compassionate man is near to the philanthropic, in that he is impelled,
apart from hunting after the receipt of anything, to do the kindness. But he is not yet philanthropic.”
Then I said, “By what deeds, then, can any one be philanthropic?” And Peter
answered, “Since I see that you are eager to hear what is the work of philanthropy, I shall
not object to telling you. He is the philanthropic man who does good even to his enemies.
And that it is so, listen: Philanthropy is masculo-feminine; and the feminine part of it is
called compassion, and the male part is named love to our neighbour. But every man is
neighbour to every man, and not merely this man or that; for the good and the bad, the
friend and the enemy, are alike men. It behoves, therefore, him who practises philanthropy
to be an imitator of God, doing good to the righteous and the unrighteous, as God Himself
vouchsafes His sun and His heavens to all in the present world. But if you will do good to
the good, but not to the evil, or even will punish them, you undertake to do the work of a
judge, you do not strive to hold by philanthropy.”</p>

<p>Then I said, “Then even God, who, as you teach us, is at some time to judge, is not
philanthropic.” Then said Peter, “You assert a contradiction; for because He shall judge,
on that very account He is philanthropic. For he who loves and compassionates those who
have been wronged, avenges those who have wronged them.” Then I said, “If, then, I also
do good to the good, and punish the wrong-doers in respect of their injuring men, am I not
philanthropic?” And Peter answered, “If along with knowledge1149 you had also authority
to judge, you would do this rightly on account of your having received authority to judge
those whom God made, and on account of your knowledge infallibly justifying some as the
righteous, and condemning some as unrighteous.” Then I said, “You have spoken rightly
and truly; for it is impossible for any one who has not knowledge to judge rightly. For
sometimes some persons seem good, though they perpetrate wickedness in secret, and some
good persons are conceived to be bad through the accusation of their enemies. But even if
one judges, having the power of torturing and examining, not even so should he altogether
judge righteously. For some persons, being murderers, have sustained the tortures, and
have come off as innocent; while others, being innocent, have not been able to sustain the
tortures, but have confessed falsely against themselves, and have been punished as guilty.”</p>

men whose sins or good deeds are partly their own, and partly those of others; but it is right
that each one be punished for his own sins, and rewarded for his own merits. But it is impossible
for any one except a prophet, who alone has omniscience, to know with respect to
the things that are done by any one, which are his own, and which are not; for all are seen
as done by him.” Then I said, “I would learn how some of men’s wrong-doings or rightdoings

<p>Then Peter answered, “The prophet of the truth has said, ‘Good things must needs come,
and blessed, said he, is he by whom they come; in like manner evil things must needs come,
but woe to him through whom they come.’1150 But if evil things come by means of evil
men, and good things are brought by good men, it must needs be in each man as his own
to be either good or bad, and proceeding from what he has proposed, in order to the coming
of the subsequent good or evil,1151 which, being of his own choice, are not arranged by the
providence of God to come from him. This being so, this is the judgment of God, that he
who, as by a combat, comes through all misfortune and is found blameless, he is deemed
worthy of eternal life; for those who by their own will continue in goodness, are tempted
by those who continue in evil by their own will, being persecuted, hated, slandered, plotted
against, struck, cheated, accused, tortured, disgraced,—suffering all these things by which
it seems reasonable that they should be enraged and stirred up to vengeance.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Offences Must Come.</head>
<p>“But the Master knowing that those who wrongfully do these things are guilty by means
of their former sins, and that the spirit of wickedness works these things by means of the
guilty, has counselled to compassionate men, as they are men, and as being the instruments
of wickedness through sin; and this counsel He has given to His disciples as claiming philanthropy,
and, as much as in us lies, to absolve the wrong-doers from condemnation, that, as
it were, the temperate may help the drunken, by prayers, fastings, and benedictions, not
resisting, not avenging, lest they should compel them to sin more. For when a person is
condemned by any one to suffer, it is not reasonable for him to be angry with him by whose
means the suffering comes; for he ought to reason, that if he had not ill-used him, yet because
he was to be ill-used, he must have suffered it by means of another. Why, then, should I be
angry with the dispenser, when I was condemned at all events to suffer? But yet, further:
if we do these same things to the evil on pretence of revenge, we who are good do the very
things which the evil do, excepting that they do them first, and we second; and, as I said,
we ought not to be angry, as knowing that in the providence of God, the evil punish the
good. Those, therefore, who are bitter against their punishers, sin, as disdaining the messengers
of God; but those who honour them, and set themselves in opposition to those who
think to injure them,1152 are pious towards God who has thus decreed.”</p>

<p>To this I answered, “Those, therefore, who do wrong are not guilty, because they wrong
the just by the judgment of God.” Then Peter said, “They indeed sin greatly, for they have
given themselves to sin. Wherefore knowing this, God chooses from among them some to
punish those who righteously repented of their former sins, that the evil things done by the
just before their repentance may be remitted through this punishment. But to the wicked
who punish and desire to ill-use them, and will not repent, it is permitted to ill-use the
righteous for the filling up of their own punishment. For without the will of God, not even
a sparrow can fall into a girn.1153 Thus even the hairs of the righteous are numbered by
God.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—The Golden Rule.</head>
<p>“But he is righteous who for the sake of what is reasonable fights with nature. For example,
it is natural to all to love those who love them. But the righteous man tries also to
love his enemies and to bless those who slander him, and even to pray for his enemies, and
to compassionate those who do him wrong. Wherefore also he refrains from doing wrong,
and blesses those who curse him, pardons those who strike him, and submits to those who
persecute him, and salutes those who do not salute him, shares such things as he has with
those who have not, persuades him that is angry with him, conciliates his enemy, exhorts
the disobedient, instructs the unbelieving, comforts the mourner; being distressed, he endures;
being ungratefully treated, he is not angry. But having devoted himself to love his neighbour
as himself, he is not afraid of poverty, but becomes poor by sharing his possessions with
those who have none. But neither does he punish the sinner. For he who loves his neighbour
as himself, as he knows that when he has sinned he does not wish to be punished, so neither
does he punish those who sin. And as he wishes to be praised, and blessed, and honoured,
and to have all his sins forgiven, thus he does to his neighbour, loving him as himself.1154
In one word, what he wishes for himself, he wishes also for his neighbour. For this is the
law of God and of the prophets1155 this is the doctrine of truth. And this perfect love towards
every man is the male part of philanthropy, but the female part of it is compassion; that is,
to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick, to take
in the stranger, to show herself to, and help to the utmost of her power, him who is in prison,
1156 and, in short, to have compassion on him who is in misfortune.”</p>

<p>But I, hearing this, said: “These things, indeed, it is impossible to do; but to do good to
enemies, bearing all their insolences, I do not think can possibly be in human nature.” Then
Peter answered: “You have said truly; for philanthropy, being the cause of immortality, is
given for much.” Then I said, “How then is it possible to get it in the mind?” Then Peter
answered: “O beloved Clement, the way to get it is this: if any one be persuaded that enemies,
ill-using for a time those whom they hate, become the cause to them of deliverances from
eternal punishment; and forthwith he will ardently love them as benefactors. But the way
to get it, O dear Clement, is but one, which is the fear of God. For he who fears God cannot
indeed from the first love his neighbour as himself; for such an order does not occur to the
soul. But by the fear of God he is able to do the things of those who love; and thus, while
he does the deeds of love, the bride Love is, as it were, brought to the bridegroom Fear. And
thus this bride, bringing forth philanthropic thoughts, makes her possessor immortal, as
an accurate image of God, which cannot be subject in its nature to corruption.” Thus while
he expounded to us the doctrine of philanthropy, the evening having set in, we turned to

<head>Chapter I.—Journey to Laodicea.</head>
<p>Now at break of day Peter entered, and said:1157 “Clement, and his mother Mattidia,
and my wife, must take their seats immediately on the waggon.” And so they did straightway.
And as we were hastening along the road to Balanæae, my mother asked me how my father
was; and I said: “My father went in search of you, and of my twin brothers Faustinus and
Faustinianus, and is now nowhere to be found. But I fancy he must have died long ago,
either perishing by shipwreck, or losing his way,1158 or wasted away by grief.” When she
heard this, she burst into tears, and groaned through grief; but the joy which she felt at
finding me, mitigated in some degree the painfulness of her recollections. And so we all
went down together to Balanæae. And on the following day we went to Paltus, and from
that to Gabala; and on the next day we reached Laodicea. And, lo! before the gates of the
city Nicetas and Aquila met us, and embracing us, brought us to our lodging. Now Peter,
seeing that the city was beautiful and great, said: “It is worth our while to stay here for some
days; for, generally speaking, a populous place is most capable of yielding us those whom
we seek.”1159 Nicetas and Aquila asked me who that strange woman was; and I said: “My
mother, whom God, through my lord Peter, has granted me to recognise.”</p>

undertaken by my mother with her twin children on the false pretext of the dream; and
furthermore, the journey undertaken by my father in search of her; and then how Peter
himself, after hearing this, went into the island, met with the woman, saw her begging, and
asked the reason of her so doing; and then ascertained who she was, and her mode of life,
and the feigned dream, and the names of her children—that is, the name borne by me, who
was left with my father, and the names of the twin children who travelled along with her,
and who, she supposed, had perished in the deep.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Recognition of Nicetas and Aquila.</head>
<p>Now when this summary narrative had been given by Peter, Nicetas and Aquila in
amazement said: “Is this indeed true, O Ruler and Lord of the universe, or is it a dream?”
And Peter said: “Unless we are asleep, it certainly is true.” On this they waited for a little
in deep meditation, and then said: “We are Faustinus and Faustinianus. From the commencement
of your conversation we looked at each other, and conjectured much with regard
to ourselves, whether what was said had reference to us or not; for we reflected that many
coincidences take place in life. Wherefore we remained silent while our hearts beat fast.
But when you came to the end of your narrative, we saw clearly1161 that your statements
referred to us, and then we avowed who we were.” And on saying this, bathed in tears, they
rushed in to see their mother; and although they found her asleep, they were yet anxious to
embrace her. But Peter forbade them, saying: “Let me bring you and present you to your
mother, lest she should, in consequence of her great and sudden joy, lose her reason, as she
is slumbering, and her spirit is held fast by sleep.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Mother Must Not Take Food with Her Son. The Reason Stated.</head>
<p>As soon as my mother had enough of sleep, she awoke, and Peter at once began first to
talk to her of true piety, saying: “I wish you to know, O woman, the course of life involved
in our religion.1162 We worship one God, who made the world which you see; and we keep
His law, which has for its chief injunctions to worship Him alone, and to hallow His name,
and to honour our parents, and to be chaste, and to live piously. In addition to this, we do
not live with all indiscriminately; nor do we take our food from the same table as Gentiles,
inasmuch as we cannot eat along with them, because they live impurely. But when we have
persuaded them to have true thoughts, and to follow a right course of action, and have
baptized them with a thrice blessed invocation, then we dwell with them. For not even if it
were our father, or mother, or wife, or child, or brother, or any other one having a claim by
nature on our affection, can we venture to take our meals with him; for our religion compels
us to make a distinction. Do not, therefore, regard it as an insult if your son does not take
his food along with you, until you come to have the same opinions and adopt the same
course of conduct as he follows.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Mattidia Wishes to Be Baptized.</head>
<p>When she heard this, she said: “What, then, prevents me from being baptized this day?
for before I saw you I turned away from the so-called gods, induced by the thought that,
though I sacrificed much to them almost every day, they did not aid me in my necessities.
And with regard to adultery, what need I say? for not even when I was rich was I betrayed
into this sin by luxury, and the poverty which succeeded has been unable to force me into
it, since I cling to my chastity as constituting the greatest beauty,1163 on account of which
I fell into so great distress. But I do not at all imagine that you, my lord Peter, are ignorant
that the greatest temptation1164 arises when everything looks bright. And therefore, if I was
chaste in my prosperity, I do not in my despondency give myself up to pleasures. Yea, indeed,
you are not to suppose that my soul has now been freed from distress, although it has received
some measure of consolation by the recognition of Clement. For the gloom which I feel in
consequence of the loss of my two children rushes in upon me, and throws its shadow to
some extent over my joy; for I am grieved, not so much because they perished in the sea,
but because they were destroyed, both soul and body, without possessing true1165 piety towards
God. Moreover, my husband, their father, as I have learned from Clement, went
away in search of me and his sons, and for so many years has not been heard of; and, without
doubt, he must have died. For the miserable man, loving me as he did in chastity, was fond
of his children; and therefore the old man, deprived of all of us who were dear to him above
everything else, died utterly broken-hearted.”</p>

of Peter, restrain themselves, but rising up, they clasped her in their arms,
showering down upon her tears and kisses. But she said: “What is the meaning of this?”
And Peter answered: “Courageously summon up your spirits, O woman, that you may enjoy
your children; for these are Faustinus and Faustinianus, your sons, who, you said, had perished
in the deep. For how they are alive, after they had in your opinion died on that most
disastrous night, and how one of them now bears the name of Nicetas, and the other that
of Aquila, they will themselves be able to tell you; for we, as well as you, have yet to learn
this.” When Peter thus spoke, my mother fainted away through her excessive joy, and was
like to die. But when we had revived her she sat up, and coming to herself, she said: “Be so

<p>And Nicetas, who in future is to be called Faustinus, began to speak. “On that very
night when, as you know, the ship went to pieces, we were taken up by some men, who did
not fear to follow the profession of robbers on the deep. They placed us in a boat, and
brought us along the coast, sometimes rowing and sometimes sending for provisions, and
at length took us to Cæsarea Stratonis,1166 and there tormented us by hunger, fear, and
blows, that we might not recklessly disclose anything which they did not wish us to tell; and,
moreover, changing our names, they succeeded in selling us. Now the woman who bought
us was a proselyte of the Jews, an altogether worthy person, of the name of Justa. She adopted
us as her own children, and zealously brought us up in all the learning of the Greeks. But
we, becoming discreet with our years, were strongly attached to her religion, and we paid
good heed to our culture, in order that, disputing with the other nations, we might be able
to convince them of their error. We also made an accurate study of the doctrines of the
philosophers, especially the most atheistic,—I mean those of Epicurus and Pyrrho,—in order
that we might be the better able to refute them.1167</p>
<note type="footnote">1166 This clause, literally translated, is, “and sometimes impelling it with oars, they brought us along the land;
and sometimes sending for provisions, they conveyed us to Cæsarea Stratonis.” The Latin translator renders

she, not a single day may pass after the recovery of my children, without my taking food

can you imagine? Am I alone heartless, so as not to wish that you should take your meals
with your mother, baptizing her this very day? But yet it is incumbent on her to fast one
day before she be baptized. And it is only one day, because, in her simplicity, she said

not herself first felt that baptism was a great gift. And for this reason I condemn many that,
after being baptized, and asserting that they have faith, they yet do nothing worthy of faith;
nor do they urge those whom they love—I mean their wives, or sons, or friends—to be
baptized.1169 For if they had believed that God grants eternal life with good works on the
acceptance of baptism,1170 they without delay would urge those whom they loved to be
baptized. But some one of you will say, ‘They do love them, and care for them.’ That is
nonsense. For do they not, most assuredly, when they see them sick, or led away along the
road that ends in death, or enduring any other trial, lament over them and pity them? So,
if they believed that eternal fire awaits those who worship not God, they would not cease
admonishing them, or being in deep distress for them as unbelievers, if they saw them disobedient,
being fully assured that punishment awaits them. But now I shall send for the

of my excessive joy, partake of food: only yesterday I took a little water.” Peter’s
wife bore testimony to her statement with an oath, saying: “In truth she did not taste anything.”
And Aquila, who must rather be called Faustinianus1174 in future, said: “There is
nothing, therefore, to prevent her being baptized.” And Peter, smiling, replied: “But that
is not a baptismal fast which has not taken place on account of the baptism itself.” And
Faustinus answered: “Perhaps God, not wishing to separate our mother a single day after
our recognition from our table, has arranged beforehand the fast. For as she was chaste in
the times of her ignorance, doing what the true religion inculcated,1175 so even now perhaps

<p>That same evening we all enjoyed the benefit of Peter’s instruction. Taking occasion
by what had happened to our mother, he showed us how the results of chastity are good,
while those of adultery are disastrous, and naturally bring destruction on the whole race, if
not speedily, at all events slowly.1176 “And to such an extent,” he says, “do deeds of chastity
please God, that in this life He bestows some small favour on account of it, even on those
who are in error; for salvation in the other world is granted only to those who have been
baptized on account of their trust1177 in Him, and who act chastely and righteously. This
ye yourselves have seen in the case of your mother, that the results of chastity are in the end
good. For perhaps she would have been cut off if she had committed adultery; but God took
pity on her for having behaved chastely, rescued her from the death that threatened her,
and restored to her her lost children.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Peter’s Speech Continued.</head>
<p>“But some one will say, ‘How many have perished on account of chastity!’ Yes; but it
was because they did not perceive the danger. For the woman who perceives that she is in
love with any one, or is beloved by any one, should immediately shun all association with
him as she would shun a blazing fire or a mad dog. And this is exactly what your mother
did, for she really loved chastity as a blessing: wherefore she was preserved, and, along with
you, obtained the full knowledge of the everlasting kingdom. The woman who wishes to
be chaste, ought to know that she is envied by wickedness, and that because of love many

will gain the victory over all temptations, and be saved; whereas, even if she were to do all
that is right, and yet should once commit the sin of adultery, she must be punished, as said
the prophet.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—Peter’s Speech Continued.</head>
<p>“The chaste wife doing the will of God, is a good reminiscence of His first creation; for
God, being one, created one woman for one man. She is also still more chaste if she does
not forget her own creation, and has future punishment before her eyes, and is not ignorant
of the loss of eternal blessings. The chaste woman takes pleasure in those who wish to be
saved, and is a pious example to the pious, for she is the model of a good life. She who
wishes to be chaste, cuts off all occasions for slander; but if she be slandered as by an enemy,
though affording him no pretext, she is blessed and avenged by God. The chaste woman
longs for God, loves God, pleases God, glorifies God; and to men she affords no occasion
for slander. The chaste woman perfumes the Church with her good reputation, and glorifies
it by her piety. She is, moreover, the praise of her teachers, and a helper to them in their
chastity.1178</p>

about her precious pearls, even chaste words. And she is radiant, for1179 her mind has been
brilliantly lighted up. Onto a beautiful mirror does she look, for she looks into God.
Beautiful cosmetics1180 does she use, namely, the fear of God, with which she admonishes
her soul. Beautiful is the woman not because she has chains of gold on her,1181 but because
she has been set free from transient lusts. The chaste woman is greatly desired by the great
King;1182 she has been wooed, watched, and loved by Him. The chaste woman does not
furnish occasions for being desired, except by her own husband. The chaste woman is
grieved when she is desired by another. The chaste woman loves her husband from the
heart, embraces, soothes, and pleases him, acts the slave to him, and is obedient to him in

<p>“Much better is it if you will take her by the hand and come, in order that you yourself

fruition of a holy marriage, and you will not scruple, if you desire it, to become a father,1184
to love your own children, and to be loved by your own children. He who wishes to have
a chaste wife is also himself chaste, gives her what is due to a wife, takes his meals with her,
keeps company with her, goes with her to the word that makes chaste, does not grieve her,
does not rashly quarrel with her, does not make himself hateful to her, furnishes her with
all the good things he can, and when he has them not, he makes up the deficiency by caresses.
The chaste wife does not expect to be caressed, recognises her husband as her lord, bears
his poverty when he is poor, is hungry with him when he is hungry, travels with him when
he travels, consoles him when he is grieved, and if she have a large1185 dowry, is subject to
him as if she had nothing at all. But if the husband have a poor wife, let him reckon her
chastity a great dowry. The chaste wife is temperate in her eating and drinking, in order
that the weariness of the body, thus pampered, may not drag the soul down to unlawful
desires. Moreover, she never assuredly remains alone with young men, and she suspects1186
the old; she turns away from disorderly laughter, gives herself up to God alone; she is not
led astray; she delights in listening to holy words, but turns away from those which are not

are not seen by men, do not make the daring a whit less eager in their impulse. Know, O
man, whose breath it is that thou hast to keep thee in life, and thou shalt not wish that it be

<p>While Peter was saying this, he saw the good and chaste Mattidia weeping for joy; but
thinking that she was grieved at having suffered so much in past times, he said:1187 “Take
courage, O woman; for while many have suffered many evils on account of adultery, you
have suffered on account of chastity, and therefore you did not die. But if you had died,
your soul would have been saved. You left your native city of Rome on account of chastity,
but through it you found the truth, the diadem of the eternal kingdom. You underwent
danger in the deep, but you did not die; and even if you had died, the deep itself would have
proved to you, dying on account of chastity, a baptism for the salvation of your soul. You
were deprived of your children for a little; but these, the true offspring of your husband,
have been found in better circumstances. When starving, you begged for food, but you did
not defile your body by fornication. You exposed your body to torture, but you saved your
soul; you fled from the adulterer, that you might not defile the couch of your husband: but,
on account of your chastity, God, who knows your flight, will fill up the place of your husband.
Grieved and left desolate, you were for a short time deprived of husband and children,
but all these you must have been deprived of, some time or other, by death, the preordained
lot of man. But better is it that you were willingly deprived of them on account of chastity,
than that you should have perished unwillingly after a time, simply on account of sins.</p>

<p>“Much better is it, then, that your first circumstances should be distressing. For when
this is the case, they do not so deeply grieve you, because you hope that they will pass away,
and they yield joy though the expectation of better circumstances. But, above all, I wish
you to know how much chastity is pleasing to God. The chaste woman is God’s choice,
God’s good pleasure, God’s glory, God’s child. So great a blessing is chastity,1188 that if
there had not been a law that not even a righteous person should enter into the kingdom of
God unbaptized, perhaps even the erring Gentiles might have been saved solely on account
of chastity. Wherefore I am exceedingly sorry for those erring ones who are chaste because
they shrink from baptism—thus choosing to be chaste without good hope. Wherefore they
are not saved; for the decree of God is clearly set down, that an unbaptized person cannot
enter into His kingdom.” When he said this, and much more, we turned to sleep.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Mattidia is Baptized in the Sea.</head>
<p>Much earlier than usual Peter awoke, and came to us, and awaking us, said: “Let
Faustinus and Faustinianus, along with Clement and the household, accompany me, that
we may go to some sheltered spot by the sea, and there be able to baptize her without attracting
observation.” Accordingly, when we had come to the sea-shore, he baptized her between
some rocks, which supplied a place at once free from wind and dust.1189 But we brothers,
along with our brother and some others, retired because of the women and bathed, and
coming again to the women, we took them along with us, and thus we went to a secret place
and prayed. Then Peter, on account of the multitude, sent the women on before, ordering
them to go to their lodging by another way, and he permitted us alone of the men to accompany
our mother and the rest of the women.1190 We went then to our lodging, and while
waiting for Peter’s arrival, we conversed with each other. Peter came several hours after,
and breaking the bread for the Eucharist,1191 and putting salt upon it, he gave it first to our
mother, and, after her, to us her sons. And thus we took food along with her and blessed
God.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Reason of Peter’s Lateness.</head>
<p>Then,1192 at length, Peter seeing that the multitude had entered, sat down, and bidding
us sit down beside him, he related first of all why he had sent us on before him after the
baptism, and why he himself had been late in returning.1193 He said that the following was
the reason: “At the time that you came up,”1194 he says, “an old man, a workman, entered
along with you, concealing himself out of curiosity. He had watched us before, as he himself
afterwards confessed, in order to see what we were doing when we entered into the sheltered
place, and then he came out secretly and followed us. And coming up to me at a convenient
place, and addressing me, he said, ‘For a long time I have been following you and wishing
to talk with you, but I was afraid that you might be angry with me, as if I were instigated by
curiosity; but now I shall tell you, if you please, what I think is the truth.’ And I replied,
‘Tell us what you think is good, and we shall approve your conduct, even should what you
say not be really good, since with a good purpose you have been anxious to state what you
deem to be good.’</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Old Man Does Not Believe in God or Providence.</head>
<p>“The old man began to speak as follows: ‘When I saw you after you had bathed in the
sea retire into the secret place, I went up and secretly watched what might be your object in
entering into a secret place, and when I saw you pray, I retired;1195 but taking pity on you,
I waited that I might speak with you when you came out, and prevail on you not to be led
astray. For there is neither God nor providence; but all things are subject to Genesis.1196
Of this I am fully assured in consequence of what I have myself endured, having for a long
time made a careful study of the science.1197 Do not therefore be deceived, my child. For
whether you pray or not, you must endure what is assigned to you by Genesis. For if prayers
could have done anything or any good, I myself should now be in better circumstances.
And now, unless my needy garments mislead you, you will not refuse to believe what I say.
I was once in affluent circumstances; I sacrificed much to the gods, I gave liberally to the
needy; and yet, though I prayed and acted piously, I was not able to escape my destiny.’
And I said: ‘What are the calamities you have endured?’ And he answered: ‘I need not tell
you now; perhaps at the end you shall learn who I am, and who are my parents, and into
what straitened circumstances I have fallen. But at present I wish you to become fully assured
that everything is subject to Genesis.’</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Peter’s Arguments Against Genesis.</head>
<p>“And I said: ‘If all things are subject to Genesis, and you are fully convinced that this
is the case, your thoughts and advice are contrary to your own opinion.1198 For if it is impossible
even to think in opposition to Genesis, why do you toil in vain, advising me to do
what cannot be done? Yea, moreover, even if Genesis subsists, do not make haste to prevail
on me not to worship Him who is also Lord of the stars, by whose wish that a thing should
not take place, that thing becomes an impossibility. For always that which is subject must
obey that which rules. As far, however, as the worship of the common gods is concerned,
that is superfluous, if Genesis has sway. For neither does anything happen contrary to what
seems good to fate, nor are they themselves able to do anything, since they are subject to
their own universal Genesis. If Genesis exists, there is this objection to it, that that which
is not first has the rule; or, in other words, the uncreated cannot be subject, for the uncreated,
as being uncreated, has nothing that is older than itself.’1199</p>
<note type="footnote">1198 Lit., “thinking you counsel what is contrary to yourself.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1199 The argument here is obscure. Probably what is intended is as follows: Genesis means origination,
coming into being. Origination cannot be the ruling power, for there must be something unoriginated which
has given rise to the origination. The origination, therefore, as not being first, cannot have sway, and it must
itself be subject to that which is unoriginated.</note>

<head>Chapter V.—Practical Refutation of Genesis.</head>
<p>“While we were thus talking, a great multitude gathered round us. And then I looked
to the multitude, and said: ‘I and my tribe have had handed down to us from our ancestors
the worship of God, and we have a commandment to give no heed to Genesis, I mean to
the science of astrology;1200 and therefore I gave no attention to it. For this reason I have
no skill in astrology, but I shall state that in which I have skill. Since I am unable to refute
Genesis by an appeal to the science which relates to Genesis, I wish to prove in another way
that the affairs of this world are managed by a providence, and that each one will receive
reward or punishment according to his actions. Whether he shall do so now or hereafter,
is a matter of no consequence to me; all I affirm is, that each one without doubt will reap
the fruit of his deeds. The proof that there is no Genesis is this. If any one of you present
has been deprived of eyes, or has his hand maimed, or his foot lame, or some other part of
the body wrong, and if it is utterly incurable, and entirely beyond the range of the medical
profession,—a case, indeed, which not even the astrologers profess to cure, for no such cure
has taken place within the lapse of a vast period,—yet I praying to God will cure it,1201 although1202
it could never have been set right by Genesis.1203 Since this is so, do not they
sin who blaspheme the God that fashioned all things?’ And the old man answered: ‘Is it
then blasphemy to say that all things are subject to Genesis?’ And I replied: ‘Most certainly
it is. For if all the sins of men, and all their acts of impiety and licentiousness, owe their
origin to the stars, and if the stars have been appointed by God to do this work, so as to be
the efficient causes of all evils, then the sins of all are traced up to Him who placed Genesis1204
in the stars.’</p>

all your incomparable demonstration, I am prevented from yielding assent by my own
personal knowledge. For I was an astrologer, and dwelt first at Rome; and then forming a
friendship with one who was of the family of Cæsar, I ascertained accurately the genesis of
himself and his wife. And tracing their history, I find all the deeds actually accomplished
in exact accordance with their genesis, and therefore I cannot yield to your argument. For
the arrangement1207 of her genesis was that which makes women commit adultery, fall in
love with their own slaves, and perish abroad in the water. And this actually took place; for

quite sure that this is true, not indeed that she married him, for I did not know even that
she fell in love with him; but after her departure, a brother of her husband’s told me the
whole story of her passion, and how he acted as an honourable man, and did not, as being
his brother, wish to pollute his couch, and how she the wretched woman (for she is not
blameable, inasmuch as she was compelled to do and suffer all this in consequence of Genesis)
longed for him, and yet stood in awe of him and his reproaches, and how she devised
a dream, whether true or false I cannot tell; for he stated that she said, “Some one in a vision
stood by me, and ordered me to leave the city of the Romans immediately with my children.”
But her husband being anxious that she should be saved with his sons, sent them immediately
to Athens for their education, accompanied by their mother and slaves, while he kept the
third and youngest son with himself, for he who gave the warning in the dream permitted
this son to remain with his father. And when a long time had elapsed, during which1208 he
received no letters from her, he himself sent frequently to Athens, and at length took me,
as the truest of all his friends, and went in search of her. And much did I exert myself along
with him in the course of our travels with all eagerness; for I remembered that, in the old
times of his prosperity, he had given me a share of all he had and loved me above all his
friends. At length we set sail from Rome itself, and so we arrived in these parts of Syria, and
we landed at Seleucia, and not many days after we had landed he died of a broken heart.

lodging was, and I pointed out mine to him; and to make sure that my conjecture was right,
I put this one question to him: ‘What was the name of the old man?’ And he said, ‘Faustus.’
‘And what were the names of his twin sons?’ And he answered, ‘Faustinus and Faustinianus.’
‘What was the name of the third son?’ He said, ‘Clement.’ ‘What was their mother’s name?’

<head>Chapter XI.—Discussion on Genesis.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “You did this according to your resolution. But in regard to Genesis,
were you merely playing a part when you affirmed it, or were you in earnest in asserting
that it existed?” Our father said: “I will not speak falsely to you. I was in earnest when I
maintained that Genesis existed. For I am not uninitiated in the science; on the contrary,
I associated with one who is the best of the astrologers, an Egyptian of the name of Annubion,
who became my friend in the commencement of my travels, and disclosed to me the death
of my wife and children.”1213 And Peter said: “Are you not now convinced by facts, that
the doctrine of Genesis has no firm foundation?” And my father answered: “I must lay
before you all the ideas that occur to my mind, that listening to them I may understand your
refutation of them.1214 I know, indeed, that astrologers both make many mistakes, and
frequently speak the truth. I suspect, therefore, that they speak the truth so far as they are
accurately acquainted with the science, and that their mistakes are the result of ignorance;
so that I conjecture that the science has a firm foundation, but that the astrologers themselves
speak what is false solely on account of ignorance, because they cannot know all things with
absolute1215 accuracy.” And Peter answered: “Consider1216 whether their speaking of the
truth is not accidental, and whether they do not make their declarations without knowing
the matters accurately. For it must by all means happen that, when many prophecies are
uttered, some of them should come true.” And the old man said: “How, then, is it possible
to be fully convinced of this, whether the science of Genesis has a sure foundation or not?”</p>

<p>When both were silent, I said: “Since I know accurately the science, but our lord and
our father are not in this condition, I should like if Annubion himself were here, to have a
discussion with him in the presence of my father. For thus would the matter be able to become
public, when one practically acquainted with the subject has held the discussion with
one equally informed.”1217 And our father answered: “Where, then, is it possible to fall in
with Annubion?” And Peter said: “In Antioch, for I learn that Simon Magus is there, whose
inseparable companion Annubion is. When, then, we go there, if we come upon them, the
discussion can take place.” And so, when we had discussed many subjects, and rejoiced at
the recognition and given thanks to God, evening came down upon us, and we turned to

each other?” And my father said: “Most assuredly.” And Peter said: “If, then, separation
from each other here gives you pain, and if without doubt the penalty awaits you that after
death you should not be with each other, how much greater will your grief be that you, a
wise man, should be separated from your own family on account of your opinions? They

in it must be vexed in regard to you?” And our father said: “You speak sense.” And Peter
said: “Why, then, will you not free them from the greatest grief they can have in regard to
you by agreeing to their religion, not, I mean, through dread, but through kindly feeling,
listening and judging about what is said by me, whether it be so or not? and if the truth is
as we state it, then here you will enjoy life with those who are dearest to you, and in the
other world you will have rest with them; but if, in examining the arguments, you show that

providential;1225 for since, if they had been with you, they perhaps would not have listened
to the doctrines of the true religion, it was arranged that your children should travel with
their mother, should be shipwrecked, should be supposed to have perished, and should be
sold;1226 moreover, that they should be educated in the learning of the Greeks, especially
in the atheistic doctrines, in order that, as being acquainted with them, they might be the
better able to refute them; and in addition to this, that they should become attached to the
true religion, and be enabled to be united with me, so as to help me in my preaching; furthermore,
that their brother Clement should meet in the same place, and that thus his
mother should be recognised, and through her cure1227 should be fully convinced of the
right worship of God;1228 that after no long interval the twins should recognise and be recognised,

Clement urged me earnestly to give in my adhesion to the truth preached by you, I at last
answered, ‘Why should I? for what new commandment can any one give more than what
the ancients urged us to obey?’ And he, with a gentle smile, said, ‘There is a great difference,
father, between the doctrines of the true religion and those of philosophy;1229 for the true
religion receives its proof from prophecy, while philosophy, furnishing us with beautiful
sentences, seems to present its proofs from conjecture.’ On saying this, he took an instance,
and set before us the doctrine of philanthropy,1230 which you had explained to him,1231
which rather appeared to me to be very unjust, and I shall tell you how. He alleged that it
was right to present to him who strikes you on the one cheek the other1232 also, and to give
to him who takes away your cloak your tunic also, and to go two miles with him who compels
you to go one, and such like.”1233</p>

<p>And Peter answered: “You have deemed unjust what is most just. If you are inclined,
will you listen to me?” And my father said: “With all my heart.” And Peter said: “What
is your opinion? Suppose that there were two kings, enemies to each other, and having their
countries cut off from each other; and suppose that some one of the subjects of one of them
were to be caught in the country of the other, and to incur the penalty of death on this account:
now if he were let off from the punishment by receiving a blow instead of death, is
it not plain that he who let him off is a lover of man?” And our father said: “Most certainly.”
And Peter said: “Now suppose that this same person were to steal from some one something
belonging to him or to another; and if when caught he were to pay double, instead of suffering
the punishment that was due to him, namely, paying four times the amount, and being also
put to death, as having been caught in the territories of the enemy; is it not your opinion
that he who accepts double, and lets him off from the penalty of death, is a lover of man?”
And our father said: “He certainly seems so.” And Peter said: “Why then? Is it not the
duty of him who is in the kingdom of another, and that, too, a hostile and wicked monarch,
to be pleasing to all1234 for the sake of life, and when force is applied to him, to yield still
more, to accost those who do not accost him, to reconcile enemies, not to quarrel with those
who are angry, to give his own property freely to all who ask, and such like?” And our

<head>Chapter VII.—The Explanation of a Parable; The Present and the Future Life.</head>
<p>And Peter1235 said: “Are not those, then, who you said received injustice, themselves
transgressors, inasmuch as they are in the kingdom of the other, and is it not by overreaching
that they have obtained all they possess? while those who are thought to act unjustly are
conferring a favour on each subject of the hostile kingdom, so far as they permit him to
have property. For these possessions belong to those who have chosen the present.1236
And they are so far kind as to permit the others to live. This, then, is the parable; now listen
to the actual truth. The prophet of the truth who appeared on earth taught us that the Maker
and God of all gave two kingdoms to two,1237 good and evil; granting to the evil the sovereignty
over the present world along with law, so that he, it, should have the right to punish
those who act unjustly; but to the good He gave the eternal1238 to come. But He made each
man free with the power to give himself up to whatsoever he prefers, either to the present
evil or the future good. Those men who choose the present have power to be rich, to revel
in luxury, to indulge in pleasures, and to do whatever they can. For they will possess none
of the future goods. But those who have determined to accept the blessings of the future
reign have no right to regard as their own the things that are here, since they belong to a
foreign king, with the exception only of water and bread, and those things procured with
sweat to maintain life (for it is not lawful for them to commit suicide),1239 and also one
garment, for they are not permitted to go naked on account of the all-seeing1240 Heaven.</p>
<note type="footnote">1235 The following words would be more appropriately put in the mouth of the father, as is done in fact by

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Present and the Future.</head>
<p>“If, then, you wish to have an accurate account of the matter, listen. Those of whom
you said a little before that they receive injustice, rather act unjustly themselves; for they
who have chosen the future blessings, live along with the bad in the present world, having
many enjoyments the same as the bad,—such as life itself, light, bread, water, clothing, and
others of a like nature. But they who are thought by you to act unjustly, shall not live with
the good men in1241 the coming age.” And our father replied to this: “Now when you have
convinced me that those who act unjustly suffer injustice themselves, while those who suffer
injustice have by far the advantage, the whole affair seems to me still more the most unjust
of transactions; for those who seem to act unjustly grant many things to those who have
chosen the future blessings, but those who seem to receive injustice do themselves commit
injustice, because they do not give in the other world, to those who have given them blessings
here, the same advantages which these gave to them.” And Peter said: “This is not unjust
at all, because each one has the power to choose the present or the future goods, whether
they be small or great. He who chooses by his own individual judgment and wish, receives
no injustice,—I mean, not even should his choice rest on what is small, since the great lay
within his choice, as in fact did also the small.” And our father said: “You are right; for it
has been said by one of the wise men of the Greeks, ‘The blame rests with those who
chose—God is blameless.’1242</p>

<p>“Will you be so good as to explain this matter also? I remember Clement saying to me,

quite correct. For we, who have chosen the future things, in so far as we possess more goods
than these, whether they be clothing, or food or drink, or any other thing, possess sins, because
we ought not to have anything, as I explained to you a little ago. To all of us possessions
are sins.1243 The deprivation of these, in whatever way it may take place, is the removal of
sins.” And our father said: “That seems reasonable, as you explained that these were the
two boundary lines of the two kings, and1244 that it was in the power of each to choose
whatever he wished of what was under their authority. But why are the afflictions sent,
or1245 do we suffer them justly?” And Peter said: “Most justly; for since the boundary line
of the saved is, as I said, that no one should possess anything, but since many have many
possessions, or in other words sins, for this reason the exceeding love of God sends afflictions
on those who do not act in purity of heart, that on account of their having some measure
of the love of God, they might, by temporary inflictions, be saved from eternal punishments.”</p>

<p>And our father said: “How then is this? Do we not see many impious men poor? Then
do these belong to the saved on this account?” And Peter said: “Not at all; for that poverty
is not acceptable which longs for what it ought not. So that some are rich as far as their
choice goes, though poor in actual wealth, and they are punished because they desire to
have more. But one is not unquestionably righteous because he happens to be poor. For
he can be a beggar as far as actual wealth is concerned, but he may desire and even do what
above everything he ought not to do. Thus he may worship idols, or be a blasphemer or
fornicator, or he may live indiscriminately, or perjure himself, or lie, or live the life of an
unbeliever. But our teacher pronounced the faithful poor blessed;1246 and he did so, not
because they had given anything, for they had nothing, but because they were not to be
condemned, as having done no sin, simply because they gave no alms, because they had
nothing to give.” And our father said: “In good truth all seems to go right as far as the
subject of discussion is concerned; wherefore I have resolved to listen to the whole of your
argument in regular order.”</p>

Now this is a state of mind in which it is improper for you to speak and for us to listen to

hold the same opinion. For if he holds the same opinion as the man who is thoroughly in
error, then he himself is in error; but if he gives his proofs holding opposite opinions, then
he is in the right. Not well1254 then do you assert that he who maintains the unity of God
is wrong, unless you believe that there are many gods. Now I maintain that there are many
gods. Holding, therefore, the same opinion as you before the discussion, I am prepossessed
rather in your favour. For this reason you ought to have no anxiety in regard to me, but
Peter ought, for I still hold opinions contrary to his. And so after your discussion I hope
that, as a truth-loving judge, who has stripped himself of his prepossessions, I shall agree
to that doctrine which gains the victor.” When my father said this, a murmur of applause
burst insensibly from the multitudes because my father had thus spoken.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Simon Appeals to the Old Testament to Prove that There are Many
Gods.</head>
<p>“For instance, in the very first words of the law, He evidently speaks of them as being
like even unto Himself. For thus it is written, that, when the first man received a commandment
from God to eat of every tree that was in the garden,1255 but not to eat of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, the serpent having persuaded them by means of the woman,
through the promise that they would become gods, made them look up;1256 and then, when
they had thus looked up, God said,1257 ‘Behold, Adam is become as one of us.’ When, then,
the serpent said,1258 ‘Ye shall be as gods,’ he plainly speaks in the belief that gods exist; all
the more as God also added His testimony, saying, ‘Behold, Adam is become as one of us.’
The serpent, then, who said that there are many gods, did not speak falsely. Again, the
scripture,1259 ‘Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy people,’ points out
many gods whom it does not wish even to be cursed. But it is also somewhere else written,
1260 ‘Did another god dare to enter and take him a nation from the midst of another
nation, as did I the Lord God?’ When He says, ‘Did another God dare?’ He speaks on the
supposition that other gods exist. And elsewhere:1261 ‘Let the gods that have not made the
heavens and the earth perish;’ as if those who had made them were not to perish. And in
another place, when it says,1262 ‘Take heed to thyself lest thou go and serve other gods whom
thy fathers knew not,’ it speaks as if other gods existed whom they were not to follow. And
again:1263 ‘The names of other gods shall not ascend upon thy lips.’ Here it mentions many
gods whose names it does not wish to be uttered. And again it is written,1264 ‘Thy God is
the Lord, He is God of gods.’ And again:1265 ‘Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the

<head>Chapter VII.—Peter Appeals to the Old Testament to Prove the Unity of God.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “I shall reply briefly to what you have said. The law, which frequently
speaks of gods, itself says to the Jewish multitude,1269 ‘Behold, the heaven of heavens is the
Lord’s thy God, with all that therein is;’ implying that, even if there are gods, they are under
Him, that is, under the God of the Jews. And again:1270 ‘The Lord thy God, He is God in
heaven above, and upon the earth beneath, and there is none other except Him.’ And
somewhere else the Scripture says to the Jewish multitude,1271 ‘The Lord your God is God
of gods;’ so that, even if there are gods, they are under the God of the Jews. And somewhere
else the Scripture says in regard to Him,1272 God, the great and true, who regardeth not
persons, nor taketh reward, He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow.’
The Scripture, in calling the God of the Jews great and true, and executing judgment, marked
out the others as small, and not true. But also somewhere else the Scripture says,1273 ‘As I
live, saith the Lord, there is no other God but me. I am the first, I am after this; except me
there is no God.’ And again:1274 ‘Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt
thou serve.’ And again:1275 ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord.’ And many
passages besides seal with an oath that God is one, and except Him there is no God. Whence
I wonder how, when so many passages testify that there is one God, you say that there are
many.”</p>

<p>And Simon said: “My original stipulation with you was that I should prove from the

Accordingly I adduced many written passages to show that the divine Scriptures themselves
speak of many gods.” And Peter said: “Those very Scriptures which speak of many gods,
also exhorted us, saying, ‘The names of other gods shall not ascend upon thy lips.’1276 Thus,
Simon, I did not speak contrary to what was written.” And Simon said: “Do you, Peter,
listen to what I have to say. You seem to me to sin in speaking against them,1277 when the
Scripture says,1278 ‘Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy people.’” And
Peter said: “I am not sinning, Simon, in pointing out their destruction according to the
Scriptures; for thus it is written:1279 ‘Let the gods who did not make the heavens and the
earth perish.’ And He said thus, not as though some had made the heavens and were not
to perish, as you interpreted the passage. For it is plainly declared that He who made them
is one in the very first part of Scripture:1280 ‘In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth. And it did not say, ‘the gods.’ And somewhere else it says,1281 ‘And the firmament

many gods; and you, in reply, brought forward as many or more from the same Scriptures,
showing that God is one, and He the God of the Jews. And when I said that we ought not
to revile gods, you proceeded to show that He who created is one, because those who did
not create will perish. And in reply to my assertion that we ought to maintain that there
are gods, because the Scriptures also say so, you showed that we ought not to utter their
names, because the same Scripture tells us not to utter the names of other gods. Since, then,
these very Scriptures say at one time that there are many gods, and at another that there is
only one; and sometimes that they ought not to be reviled, and at other times that they
ought; what conclusion ought we to come to in consequence of this, but that the Scriptures
themselves lead us astray?”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Peter’s Explanation of the Apparent Contradictions of Scripture.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “They do not lead astray, but convict and bring to light the evil disposition
against God which lurks like a serpent in each one. For the Scriptures lie before each
one like many divers types. Each one, then, has his own disposition like wax, and examining
the Scriptures and finding everything in them, he moulds his idea of God according to his
wish, laying upon them, as I said, his own disposition, which is like wax.1283 Since, then,
each one finds in the Scriptures whatever opinion he wishes to have in regard to God, for
this reason he, Simon, moulds from them the forms1284 of many gods, while we moulded
the form of Him who truly exists, coming to the knowledge of the true type from our own
shape.1285 For assuredly the soul within us is clothed with His image for immortality. If I
abandon the parent of this soul, it also will abandon me to just judgment, making known
the injustice by the very act of daring;1286 and as coming from one who is just, it will justly
abandon me; and so, as far as the soul is concerned, I shall, after punishment, be destroyed,
having abandoned the help that comes from it. But if there is another god, first let him put
on another form, another shape, in order that by the new shape of the body I may recognise
the new god. But if he should change the shape, does he thereby change the substance of
the soul? But if he should change it also, then I am no longer myself, having become another
both in shape and in substance. Let him, therefore, create others, if there is another. But
there is not. For if there had been, he would have created. But since he has not created,
then let him, as nonexistent, leave him who is really existent.1287 For he is nobody,1288 except
only in the opinion of Simon. I do not accept of any other god but Him alone who created
me.”</p>

On this account, also, one man was made, and from him went forth also the female. And
being a unity generically, it is yet a duality, for by expansion and contraction the unity is
thought to be a duality. So that I act rightly in offering up all the honour to one God as to

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Contradictions of the Scriptures Intended to Try Those Who
Read Them.</head>
<p>And Peter answered:1292 “If the Scriptures or prophets speak of gods, they do so to try
those who hear. For thus it is written:1293 ‘If there arise among you a prophet, giving signs
and wonders, and that sign and wonder shall then come to pass, and he say to thee, Let us
go after and worship other gods which thy fathers have not known, ye1294 shall not hearken
to the words of that prophet; let thy hands be among the first to stone him. For he hath
tried to turn thee from the Lord thy God. But if thou say in thy heart, How did he do that
sign or wonder? thou shalt surely know that he who tried thee, tried thee to see if thou dost
fear the Lord thy God.’ The words ‘he who tried thee, tried thee,’ have reference to the
earliest times;1295 but it appears to be otherwise after the removal to Babylon. For God,
who knows all things, would not, as can be proved by many arguments, try in order that He
Himself might know, for He fore-knows all things. But, if you like, let us discuss this point,
and I shall show that God foreknows. But it has been proved that the opinion is false that
He does not know, and that this was written to try us. Thus we, Simon, can be led astray1296
neither by the Scriptures nor by any one else; nor are we deceived into the admission of
many gods, nor do we agree to any statement that is made against God.</p>

He who spake at the bush, and wrestled with Jacob,—and the name is likewise applied
to Him who is born Emmanuel, and who is called the mighty God.1297 Yea, even Moses
became a god to Pharaoh, though in reality he was a man. The same is the case also with
the idols of the Gentiles. But we have but one God, one who made creation and arranged
the universe, whose Son is the Christ. Obeying Christ,1298 we learn to know what is false
from the Scriptures. Moreover, being furnished by our ancestors with the truths of the
Scriptures, we know that there is only one who has made the heavens and the earth, the God
of the Jews, and of all who choose to worship Him. Our fathers, with pious thought, setting
down a fixed belief in Him as the true God, handed down this belief to us, that we may know
that if any thing is said against God, it is a falsehood. I shall add this remark over and above

there were gods except the Creator of all, nor did He proclaim Himself to be God, but He
with reason pronounced blessed him who called Him the Son of that God who has arranged

is unbegotten or self-begotten.” And Simon said: “Is it not the same on account of its origin?”
1300 And Peter said: “He who is not the same in all respects as some one, cannot have
all the same appellations applied to him as that person.” And Simon said: “This is to assert,
not to prove.” And Peter said: “Why, do you not see that if1301 the one happens to be selfbegotten
or unbegotten, they cannot be called the same; nor can it be asserted of him who
has been begotten that he is of the same substance as he is who has begotten him?1302 Learn
this also: The bodies of men have immortal souls, which have been clothed with the breath
of God; and having come forth from God, they are of the same substance, but they are not
gods. But if they are gods, then in this way the souls of all men, both those who have died,
and those who are alive, and those who shall come into being, are gods. But if in a spirit of
controversy you maintain that these also are gods, what great matter is it, then, for Christ
to be called God? for He has only what all have.</p>

cannot in like manner be boundless. But if any one says that it is possible, he is wrong; for
two things boundless on every side cannot co-exist, for the one is bounded by the other.
Thus it is in the nature1303 of things that the unbegotten is one. But if he possesses a figure,

impressed as it has thus been with the greatest seal?” And Peter said: “It is the shape of the
just God. When, then, the body begins to act unjustly, the form which is in it takes to flight,
and thus the body is dissolved, by the shape disappearing, in order that an unjust body may
not have the shape of the just God. The dissolution, however, does not take place in regard
to the seal, but in regard to the sealed body. But that which is sealed is not dissolved without
Him who sealed it. And thus it is not permitted to die without judgment.” And Simon
said: “What necessity was there to give the shape of such a being to man, who was raised
from the earth?” And Peter said: “This was done because of the love of God, who made
man. For while, as far as substance is concerned, all things are superior to the flesh of
man,—I mean the ether, the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, the water, the fire—in a word,
all the other things which have been made for the service of man,—yet, though superior in
substance, they willingly endure to serve the inferior in substance, because of the shape of
the superior. For as they who honour the clay image of a king have paid honour to the king
himself, whose shape the clay happens to have, so the whole creation with joy serves man,
who is made from earth, looking to the honour thus paid to God.</p>

written in the books1310 against the framer1311 of the world does not happen to be true, tomorrow
I shall show, from the discourses of your teacher, that he asserted that the framer
of the world was not the highest God.” And when Simon said this, he went out. But Peter
said to the assembled multitudes: “If Simon can do no other injury to us in regard to God,
he at least prevents you from listening to the words that can purify the soul.” On Peter
saying this, much whispering arose amongst the crowds, saying, “What necessity is there
for permitting him to come in here, and utter his blasphemies against God?” And Peter
heard, and said, “Would that the doctrines against God which are intended to try men1312
went no further than Simon! For there will be, as the Lord said, false apostles, false prophets,
1313 heresies, desires for supremacy, who, as I conjecture, finding their beginning in Simon,
who blasphemes God, will work together in the assertion of the same opinions against
God as those of Simon.” And saying this with tears, he summoned the multitudes to him
by his hand; and when they came, he laid his hands upon them and prayed, and then dismissed
them, telling them to come at an earlier hour next day. Saying this, and groaning,
he entered and went to sleep, without taking food.</p>

<p>The next day, therefore, as Peter was to hold a discussion with Simon, he rose earlier
than usual and prayed. On ceasing to pray, Zacchæus came in, and said: “Simon is seated
without, discoursing with about thirty of his own special followers.” And Peter said: “Let
him talk until the multitude assemble, and then let us begin the discussion in the following
way. We shall hear all that has been said by him, and having fitted our reply to this, we shall
go out and discourse.” And assuredly so it happened. Zacchæus, therefore, went out, and
not long after entered again, and communicated to Peter the discourse delivered by Simon

<head>Chapter II.—Simon’s Speech Against Peter.</head>
<p>Now he said: “He accuses you, Peter, of being the servant of wickedness, of having great
power in magic, and as charming the souls of men in a way worse than idolatry.1315 To
prove that you are a magician, he seemed to me to adduce the following evidence, saying:
‘I am conscious of this, that when I come to hold a discussion with him, I do not remember
a single word of what I have been meditating on by myself. For while he is discoursing, and
my mind is engaged in recollecting what it is that I thought of saying on coming to a conference
with him, I do not hear anything whatsoever of what he is saying. Now, since I do not
experience this in the presence of any other than in his alone, is it not plain that I am under
the influence of his magic? And as to his doctrines being worse than those of idolatry, I can
make that quite clear to any one who has understanding. For there is no other benefit than
this, that the soul should be freed from images1316 of every kind. For when the soul brings
an image before its eye, it is bound by fear, and it pines away through anxiety lest it should
suffer some calamity; and being altered, it falls under the influence of a demon; and being
under his influence, it seems to the mass to be wise.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Simon’s Accusation of Peter.</head>
<p>“‘Peter does this to you while promising to make you wise. For, under the pretext of
proclaiming one God, he seems to free you from many lifeless images, which do not at all
injure those who worship them, because they are seen by the eyes themselves to be made of
stone, or brass, or gold, or of some other lifeless material. Wherefore the soul, because it
knows that what is seen is nothing, cannot be spell-bound by fear in an equal degree by
means of what is visible. But looking to a terrible God through the influence of deceptive
teaching, it has all its natural foundations overturned. And I say this, not because I exhort
you to worship images, but because Peter, seeming to free your souls from terrible images,1317
drives mad the mind of each one of you by a more terrible image, introducing God in a
shape, and that, too, a God extremely just,—an image which is accompanied by what is
terrible and awful to the contemplative soul, by that which can entirely destroy the energy
of a sound mind. For the mind, when in the midst of such a storm, is like the depth stirred
by a violent wind, perturbed and darkened. Wherefore, if he comes to benefit you, let him
not, while seeming to dissolve your fears which gently proceed from lifeless shapes, introduce
in their stead the terrible shape of God. But has God a shape? If He has, He possesses a
figure. And if He has a figure, how is He not limited? And if limited, He is in space. But
if He is in space, He is less than the space which encloses Him. And if less than anything,
how is He greater than all, or superior to all, or the highest of all? This, then, is the state of
the case.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—It is Asserted that Christ’s Teaching is Different from Peter’s.</head>
<p>“‘And that he does not really believe even the doctrines proclaimed by his teacher is
evident, for he proclaims doctrines opposite to his.1318 For he said to some one, as I learn,1319
“Call me not good, for the good is one.” Now in speaking of the good one, he no longer
speaks of that just one,1320 whom the Scriptures proclaim, who kills and makes alive,—kills
those who sin, and makes alive those who live according to His will. But that he did not
really call Him who is the framer of the world good, is plain to any one who can reflect. For
the framer of the world was known to Adam whom He had made, and to Enoch who pleased
Him, and to Noah who was seen to be just by Him; likewise to Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob; also to Moses, and the people, and the whole world. But Jesus, the teacher of Peter
himself, came and said,1321 “No one knew the Father except the Son, as no one knoweth1322
even the Son except the Father, and those to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.” If,
then, it was the Son himself who was present, it was from the time of his appearance that
he began to reveal to those to whom he wished, Him who was unknown to all. And thus
the Father was unknown to all who lived before him, and could not thus be He who was
known to all.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Jesus Inconsistent in His Teaching.</head>
<p>“‘In saying this, Jesus is consistent not even with himself. For sometimes by other utterances,
taken from the Scriptures, he presents God as being terrible and just, saying,1323
“Fear not him who killeth the body, but can do nothing to the soul; but fear Him who is
able to cast both body and soul into the Gehenna of fire. Yea, I say unto you, fear Him.”
But that he asserted that He is really to be feared as being a just God, to whom he says those
who receive injustice cry, is shown in a parable of which he gives the interpretation, saying:
1324 “If, then, the unjust judge did so, because he was continually entreated, how much
more will the Father avenge those who cry to Him day and night? Or do you think that,
because He bears long with them, He will not do it? Yea, I say to you, He will do it, and that
speedily.” Now he who speaks of God as an avenging and rewarding God, presents Him as
naturally just, and not as good. Moreover he gives thanks to the Lord of heaven and
earth.1325 But if He is Lord of heaven and earth, He is acknowledged to be the framer of
the world, and if framer, then He is just. When, therefore, he sometimes calls Him good
and sometimes just, he is not consistent with himself in this point.1326 But his wise disciple
maintained yesterday a third point, that real sight1327 is more satisfactory than vision, not
knowing that real sight can be human, but that vision confessedly proceeds from divinity.</p>

<p>“These and such like were the statements, Peter, which Simon addressed to the multitudes
while he stood outside; and he seems to me to be disturbing the minds of the greater number.
Wherefore go forth immediately, and by the power of truth break down his false statements.”
When Zacchæus said this, Peter prayed after his usual manner and went out, and standing
in the place where he spoke the day before, and saluting the multitudes according to the
custom enjoined by his religion, he began to speak as follows: “Our Lord Jesus Christ, who
is the true prophet (as I shall prove conclusively at the proper time), made concise declarations
in regard to those matters that relate to the truth, for these two reasons: first, because
He was in the habit of addressing the pious, who had knowledge enough to enable them to
believe the opinions uttered by Him by way of declaration; for His statements were not
strange to their usual mode of thought; and in the second place, because, having a limited
time assigned Him for preaching, He did not employ the method of demonstration in order
that He might not spend all His limited time in arguments, for in this way it might happen
that He would be fully occupied in giving the solutions of a few problems which might be
understood by mental exertion, while He would not have given us to any great extent1328
those statements which relate to the truth. Accordingly He stated any opinions He wished,
as to a people who were able to understand Him, to whom we also belong, who, whenever
we did not understand anything of what had been said by Him,—a thing which rarely
happened,—inquired of Him privately, that nothing said by Him might be unintelligible to
us.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Man in the Shape of God.</head>
<p>“Knowing therefore that we knew all that was spoken by Him, and that we could supply
the proofs, He sent us to the ignorant Gentiles to baptize them for remission of sins, and
commanded us to teach them first.1329 Of His commandments this is the first and great
one, to fear the Lord God, and to serve Him only. But He meant us to fear that God whose
angels they are who are the angels of the least of the faithful amongst us, and who stand in
heaven continually beholding the face of the Father.1330 For He has shape, and He has every
limb primarily and solely for beauty’s sake, and not for use.1331 For He has not eyes that
He may see with them; for He sees on every side, since He is incomparably more brilliant
in His body than the visual spirit which is in us, and He is more splendid than everything,
so that in comparison with Him the light of the sun may be reckoned as darkness. Nor has
He ears that He may hear; for He hears, perceives, moves, energizes, acts on every side. But
He has the most beautiful shape on account of man, that the pure in heart1332 may be able
to see Him, that they may rejoice because they suffered. For He moulded man in His own
shape as in the grandest seal, in order that he may be the ruler and lord of all, and that all
may be subject to him. Wherefore, judging that He is the universe, and that man is His
image (for He is Himself invisible, but His image man is visible), the man who wishes to
worship Him honours His visible image, which is man. Whatsoever therefore any one does
to man, be it good or bad, is regarded as being done to Him. Wherefore the judgment which
proceeds from Him shall go before, giving to every one according to his merits. For He
avenges His own shape.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—God’s Figure: Simon’s Objection Therefrom Refuted.</head>
<p>“But someone will say, If He has shape, then He has figure also, and is in space; but if
He is in space, and is, as being less, enclosed by it, how is He great above everything? How
can He be everywhere if He has figure? The first remark I have to make to him who urges
these objections is this: The Scriptures persuade us to have such sentiments and to believe
such statements in regard to Him; and we know that their declarations are true, for witness
is borne to them by our Lord Jesus Christ, by whose orders we are bound to afford proofs
to you that such is the case. But first I shall speak of space. The space of God is the nonexistent,
but God is that which exists. But that which is non-existent cannot be compared
with that which is existent. For how can space be existent? unless it be a second space, such
as heaven, earth, water, air, and if there is any other body that fills up the vacuity, which is
called vacuity on this account, that it is nothing. For ‘nothing’ is its more appropriate name.
For what is that which is called vacuity but as it were a vessel which contains nothing, except
the vessel itself? But being vacuity, it is not itself space; but space is that in which vacuity
itself is, if indeed it is the vessel. For it must be the case that that which exists is in that which
does not exist. But by this which is non-existent I mean that which is called by some, space,
which is nothing. But being nothing, how can it be compared with that which is, except by
expressing the contrary, and saying that it is that which does not exist, and that that which
does not exist is called space? But even if it were something, there are many examples which
I have at hand, but I shall content myself with one only, to show that that which encloses is
not unquestionably superior to that which is enclosed. The sun is a circular figure, and is
entirely enclosed by air, yet it lightens up the air, it warms it, it divides it; and if the sun be
away from it, it is enveloped in darkness; and from whatsoever part of it the sun is removed,
it becomes cold as if it were dead; but again it is illuminated by its rising, and when it has
been warmed up by it, it is adorned with still greater beauty. And it does this by giving a
share of itself, though it has its substance limited. What, then, is there to prevent God, as
being the Framer and Lord of this and everything else, from possessing figure and shape
and beauty, and having the communication of these qualities proceeding from Himself extended
infinitely?</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—God the Centre or Heart of the Universe.</head>
<p>“One, then, is the God who truly exists, who presides in a superior shape, being the
heart of that which is above and that which is below twice,1333 which sends forth from Him
as from a centre the life-giving and incorporeal power; the whole universe with the stars
and regions1334 of the heaven, the air, the fire, and if anything else exists, is proved to be a
substance infinite in height, boundless in depth, immeasurable in breadth, extending the
life-giving and wise nature from Him over three infinites.1335 It must be, therefore, that
this infinite which proceeds from Him on every side exists,1336 having as its heart Him who
is above all, and who thus possesses figure; for wherever He be, He is as it were in the centre
of the infinite, being the limit of the universe. And the extensions taking their rise with
Him, possess the nature of six infinites; of whom the one taking its rise with Him penetrates1337
into the height above, another into the depth below, another to the right hand,
another to the left, another in front, and another behind; to whom He Himself, looking as
to a number that is equal on every side,1338 completes the world in six temporal intervals,1339
Himself being the rest,1340 and having the infinite age to come as His image, being the beginning
and the end. For in Him the six infinites end, and from Him they receive their extension

He is alone, sometimes comprehensible, sometimes incomprehensible, sometimes limitable,
1341 sometimes illimitable, having extensions which proceed from Him into infinity.
For thus He is comprehensible and incomprehensible, near and far, being here and there,
as being the only existent one, and as giving a share of that mind which is infinite on every
hand, in consequence of which souls breathe and possess life;1342 and if they be separated
from the body and be found with a longing for Him, they are borne along into His bosom,
as in the winter time the mists of the mountains, attracted by the rays of the sun, are borne
along immortal1343 to it. What affection ought therefore to arise within us if we gaze with

<p>“But some who are strangers to the truth, and who give their energies to the service of

and formless, He may be visible to no one, so as not to be longed for. For the mind, not
seeing the form of God, is empty of Him. But how can any one pray if he has no one to
whom he may flee for refuge, on whom he may lean? For if he meets with no resistance, he
falls out into vacuity. Yea, says he, we ought not to fear God, but to love Him. I agree; but
the consciousness of having done well in each good act will accomplish this. Now well-doing
proceeds from fearing. But fear, says he, strikes death into the soul. Nay, but I affirm that
it does not strike death, but awakens the soul, and converts it. And perhaps the injunction
not to fear God might be right, if we men did not fear many other things; such, for instance,
as plots against us by those who are like us, and wild beasts, serpents, diseases, sufferings,
demons, and a thousand other ills. Let him, then, who asks us not to fear God, rescue us
from these, that we may not fear them; but if he cannot, why should he grudge that we
should be delivered from a thousand fears by one fear, the fear of the Just One, and that it
should be possible by a slight1344 faith in Him to remove a thousand afflictions from ourselves

God, let him not fear; for under the influence of love to Him one cannot do what is displeasing
to Him. For, on the one hand, it is written that we are to fear Him, and we have been
commanded to love Him, in order that each of us may use that prescription which is suitable
to his constitution. Fear Him, therefore, because He is just; but whether you fear Him or
love Him, sin not. And may it be the case that any one who fears Him shall be able to gain
the victory over unlawful desires, shall not lust after what belongs to others, shall practise
kindness, shall be sober, and act justly! For I see some who are imperfect in their fear of
Him sinning very much. Let us therefore fear God, not only because He is just; for it is
through pity for those who have received injustice that He inflicts punishment on those
who have done the injustice. As water therefore quenches fire, so does fear extinguish the
desire for evil practices. He who teaches fearlessness does not himself fear; but he who does
not fear, does not believe that there will be a judgment, strengthens his lusts, acts as a magician,
and accuses others of the deeds which he himself does.”</p>

and deeds1346 of your teacher because you saw them before you with your own eyes,1347
and heard them with your own ears, and that it is not possible for any other to have anything
similar by vision or apparition. But I shall show that this is false. He who hears any one
with his own ears, is not altogether fully assured of the truth of what is said; for his mind
has to consider whether he is wrong or not, inasmuch as he is a man as far as appearance
goes. But apparition not merely presents an object to view, but inspires him who sees it

<p>And Peter said: “You proposed to speak to one point, you replied to another.1349 For
your proposition was, that one is better able to know more fully, and to attain confidence,1350
when he hears in consequence of an apparition, than when he hears with his own ears; but
when you set about the matter, you were for persuading us that he who hears through an
apparition is surer than he who hears with his own ears. Finally, you alleged that, on this
account, you knew more satisfactorily the doctrines of Jesus than I do, because you heard
His words through an apparition. But I shall reply to the proposition you made at the beginning.
The prophet, because he is a prophet, having first given certain information with
regard to what is objectively1351 said by him, is believed with confidence; and being known
beforehand to be a true prophet, and being examined and questioned as the disciple wishes,
he replies: But he who trusts to apparition or vision and dream is insecure. For he does
not know to whom he is trusting. For it is possible either that he may be an evil demon or
a deceptive spirit, pretending in his speeches to be what he is not. But if any one should
wish to inquire of him who he is who has appeared, he can say to himself whatever he likes.
And thus, gleaming forth like a wicked one, and remaining as long as he likes, he is at length
extinguished, not remaining with the questioner so long as he wished him to do for the
purpose of consulting him. For any one that sees by means of dreams cannot inquire about
whatever he may wish. For reflection is not in the special power of one who is asleep. Hence
we, desiring to have information in regard to something in our waking hours, inquire about
something else in our dreams; or without inquiring, we hear about matters that do not
concern us, and awaking from sleep we are dispirited because we have neither heard nor
inquired about those matters which we were eager to know.”</p>

<p>And Simon said: “If you maintain that apparitions do not always reveal the truth, yet
for all that, visions and dreams, being God-sent, do not speak falsely in regard to those
matters which they wish to tell.” And Peter said: “You were right in saying that, being Godsent,
they do not speak falsely. But it is uncertain if he who sees has seen a God-sent dream.”
And Simon said: “If he who has had the vision is just, he has seen a true vision.” And Peter
said: “You were right. But who is just, if he stands in need of a vision that he may learn
what he ought to learn, and do what he ought to do?” And Simon said: “Grant me this,
that the just man alone can see a true vision, and I shall then reply to that other point. For
I have come to the conclusion that an impious man does not see a true dream.” And Peter
said: “This is false; and I can prove it both apart from Scripture and by Scripture; but I do
not undertake to persuade you. For the man who is inclined to fall in love with a bad woman,
does not change his mind so as to care for a lawful union with another woman in every respect
good; but sometimes they love the worse woman through prepossessions, though they are
conscious that there is another who is more excellent. And you are ignorant, in consequence
of some such state of mind.” And Simon said: “Dismiss this subject, and discuss the matter
on which you promised to speak. For it seems to me impossible that impious men should
receive dreams from God in any way whatever.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—None But Evil Demons Appear to the Impious.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “I remember that I promised to prove this point, and to give my proofs
in regard to it from Scripture and apart from Scripture. And now listen to what I say. We
know that there are many (if you will pardon me the statement; and if you don’t, I can appeal
to those who are present as judges) who worship idols, commit adultery, and sin in every
way, and yet they see true visions and dreams, and some of them have also apparitions of
demons. For I maintain that the eyes of mortals cannot see the incorporeal form of the
Father or Son, because it is illumined by exceeding great light. Wherefore it is not because
God envies, but because He pities, that He cannot be seen by man who has been turned into
flesh. For he who sees God cannot live. For the excess of light dissolves the flesh of him
who sees; unless by the secret power of God the flesh be changed into the nature of light, so
that it can see light, or the substance of light be changed into flesh, so that it can be seen by
flesh. For the power to see the Father, without undergoing any change, belongs to the Son
alone. But the just shall also in like manner behold God;1352 for in the resurrection of the
dead, when they have been changed, as far as their bodies are concerned, into light, and
become like the angels, they shall be able to see Him. Finally, then, if any angel be sent that
he may he seen by a man, he is changed into flesh, that he may be able to be seen by flesh.
For no one can see the incorporeal power not only of the Son, but not even of an angel. But
if one sees an apparition, he should know that this is the apparition of an evil demon.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Impious See True Dreams and Visions.</head>
<p>“But it is manifest that the impious see true visions and dreams, and I can prove it from
Scripture. Finally, then, it is written in the law, how Abimelech, who was impious, wished
to defile the wife of just Abraham by intercourse, and how he heard the commandment
from God in his sleep, as the Scripture saith, not to touch her,1353 because she was dwelling
with her husband. Pharaoh, also an impious man, saw a dream in regard to the fulness and
thinness of the ears of corn,1354 to whom Joseph said, when he gave the interpretation, that
the dream had come from God.1355 Nebuchadnezzar, who worshipped images, and ordered
those who worshipped God to be cast into fire, saw a dream1356 extending over the whole
age of the world.1357 And let no one say, ‘No one who is impious sees a vision when awake.’
That is false. Nebuchadnezzar himself, having ordered three men to be cast into fire, saw
a fourth when he looked into the furnace, and said, ‘I see the fourth as the Son of God.’1358
And nevertheless, though they saw apparitions, visions, and dreams, they were impious.
Thus, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the man who has seen visions, and dreams,
and apparitions, is undoubtedly pious. For in the case of the pious man, the truth gushes
up natural and pure1359 in his mind, not worked up through dreams, but granted to the
good through intelligence.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Nature of Revelation.</head>
<p>“Thus to me also was the Son revealed by the Father. Wherefore I know what is the
meaning of revelation, having learned it in my own case. For at the very time when the
Lord said, ‘Who do they say that I am?’1360 and when I heard one saying one thing of Him,
and another another, it came into my heart to say (and I know not, therefore, how I said it),
‘Thou art the Son of the living God.’1361 But He, pronouncing me blessed, pointed out to
me that it was the Father who had revealed it to me; and from this time I learned that revelation
is knowledge gained without instruction, and without apparition and dreams. And
this is indeed the case. For in the soul1362 which has been placed in us by1363 God, there is
all the truth; but it is covered and revealed by the hand of God, who works so far as each
one through his knowledge deserves.1364 But the declaration of anything by means of apparitions
and dreams from without is a proof, not that it comes from revelation, but from
wrath. Finally, then, it is written in the law, that God, being angry, said to Aaron and
Miriam,1365 ‘If a prophet arise from amongst you, I shall make myself known to him through
visions and dreams, but not so as to my servant Moses; because I shall speak to him in an
outward appearance, and not through dreams, just as one will speak to his own friend.’ You
see how the statements of wrath are made through visions and dreams, but the statements
to a friend are made face to face, in outward appearance, and not through riddles and visions
and dreams, as to an enemy.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Opposition to Peter Unreasonable.</head>
<p>“If, then, our Jesus appeared to you in a vision, made Himself known to you, and spoke
to you, it was as one who is enraged with an adversary; and this is the reason why it was
through visions and dreams, or through revelations that were from without, that He spoke
to you. But can any one be rendered fit for instruction through apparitions? And if you
will say, ‘It is possible,’ then I ask, ‘Why did our teacher abide and discourse a whole year
to those who were awake?’ And how are we to believe your word, when you tell us that He
appeared to you? And how did He appear to you, when you entertain opinions contrary to
His teaching? But if you were seen and taught by Him, and became His apostle for a single
hour, proclaim His utterances, interpret His sayings, love His apostles, contend not with
me who companied with Him. For in direct opposition to me, who am a firm rock, the
foundation of the Church,1366 you now stand. If you were not opposed to me, you would
not accuse me, and revile the truth proclaimed by me, in order that I may not be believed
when I state what I myself have heard with my own ears from the Lord, as if I were evidently
a person that was condemned and in bad repute.1367 But if you say that I am condemned,
you bring an accusation against God, who revealed the Christ to me, and you inveigh against
Him who pronounced me blessed on account of the revelation. But if, indeed, you really
wish to work in the cause of truth, learn first of all from us what we have learned from Him,
and, becoming a disciple of the truth, become a fellow-worker with us.”</p>

were made that I may see if you can prove that actual sight is more distinct than apparition.
1368 But you spoke according to your own pleasure; you did not prove. And now, tomorrow
I shall come to your opinions in regard to God, whom you affirmed to be the framer

<head>Chapter I.—Simon Maintains that the Framer of the World is Not the Highest God.</head>
<p>At break of day, when Peter went forth to discourse, Simon anticipated him, and said:
“When I went away yesterday, I promised to you to return to-day, and in a discussion show
that he who framed the world is not the highest God, but that the highest God is another
who alone is good, and who has remained unknown up to this time. At once, then, state to
me whether you maintain that the framer of the world is the same as the lawgiver or not?
If, then, he is the lawgiver, he is just; but if he is just, he is not good. But if he is not good,
then it was another that Jesus proclaimed, when he said,1369 ‘Do not call me good; for one
is good, the Father who is in the heavens.’ Now a lawgiver cannot be both just and good,
for these qualities do not harmonize.”1370 And Peter said: “First tell us what are the actions
which in your opinion constitute a person good, and what are those which constitute him
just, in order that thus we may address our words to the same mark.” And Simon said: “Do
you state first what in your opinion is goodness, and what justice.”</p>

<p>And Peter said: “That I may not waste my time in contentious discussions, while I make
the fair demand that you should give answers to my propositions, I shall myself answer
those questions which I put, as is your wish. I then affirm that the man who bestows1371
goods is good, just as I see the Framer of the world doing when He gives the sun to the good,
and the rain to the just and unjust.” And Simon said: “It is most unjust that he should give
the same things to the just and the unjust.” And Peter said: “Do you, then, in your turn
state to us what course of conduct would constitute Him good.” And Simon said: “It is you
that must state this.” And Peter said: “I will. He who gives the same things to the good and
just, and also to the evil and unjust, is not even just according to you; but you would with
reason call Him just if He gave goods to the good and evils to the evil. What course of
conduct, then, would He adopt, if He does not adopt the plan of giving things temporal to
the evil, if perchance they should be converted, and things eternal to the good, if at least
they remain good? And thus by giving to all, but by gratifying the more excellent,1372 His
justice is good; and all the more long-suffering in this, that to sinners who repent He freely
grants forgiveness of their sins, and to those who have acted well He assigns even eternal
life. But judging at last, and giving to each one what he deserves, He is just. If, then, this is
right, confess it; but if it appears to you not to be right, refute it.”</p>

<head>Chapter III.—God Both Good and Just.</head>
<p>And Simon said: “I said once for all, ‘Every lawgiver, looking to justice, is just.’” And
Peter said: “If it is the part of him who is good not to lay down a law, but of him who is just
to lay down a law, in this way the Framer of the world is both good and just. He is good,
inasmuch as it is plain that He did not lay down a law in writing from the times of Adam
to Moses; but inasmuch as He had a written law from Moses to the present times,1373 He
is just also.” And Simon said: “Prove to me from the utterances of your teacher that it is
within the power of the same man to be good and just; for to me it seems impossible that
the lawgiver who is good should also be just.” And Peter said: “I shall explain to you how
goodness itself is just. Our teacher Himself first said to the Pharisee who asked Him,1374
‘What shall I do to inherit eternal life?’ ‘Do not call me good; for one is good, even the
Father who is in the heavens;’ and straightway He introduced these words, ‘But if thou shalt
wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.’ And when he said, ‘What commandments?’
He pointed him to those of the law. Now He would not, if He were indicating some other
good being, have referred him to the commandments of the Just One. That indeed justice
and goodness are different I allow, but you do not know that it is within the power of the
same being to be good and just. For He is good, in that He is now long-suffering with the
penitent, and welcomes them; but just, when acting as judge He will give to every one according
to his deserts.”</p>

<p>And Simon said: “How, then, if the framer of the world, who also fashioned Adam, was
known, and known too by those who were just according to the law, and moreover by the
just and unjust, and the whole world, does your teacher, coming after all these, say,1375 ‘No
one has known the Father but the Son, even as no one knoweth the Son but the Father, and
those to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him?’ But he would not have made this statement,
had he not proclaimed a Father who was still unrevealed, whom the law speaks of as the
highest, and who has not given any utterance either good or bad (as Jeremiah testifies in
the Lamentations1376); who also, limiting the nations to seventy languages, according to
the number of the sons of Israel who entered Egypt, and according to the boundaries of
these nations, gave to his own Son, who is also called Lord, and who brought into order the
heaven and the earth, the Hebrews as his portion, and defined him to be God of gods, that
is, of the gods who received the other nations as their portions. Laws, therefore, proceeded
from all the so-called gods to their own divisions, which consist of the other nations. In
like manner also from the Son of the Lord of all came forth the law which is established
among the Hebrews. And this state of matters was determined on, that if any one should
seek refuge in the law of any one, he should belong to the division of him whose law he
undertook to obey. No one knew the highest Father, who was unrevealed, just as they did
not know that his Son was his Son. Accordingly at this moment you yourself, in assigning
the special attributes of the unrevealed Most High to the Son, do not know that he is the
Son, being the Father of Jesus, who with you is called the Christ.”</p>

Peter said: “You do not understand what I mean, Simon. But listen and understand. When
it is said that the Son will reveal Him to whom He wishes, it is meant that such an one is to
learn of Him not by instruction, but by revelation only. For it is revelation when that which
lies secretly veiled in all the hearts of men is revealed unveiled by His God’s own will without
any utterance. And thus knowledge comes to one, not because he has been instructed, but
because he has understood. And yet the person who understands it cannot demonstrate it
to another, since he did not himself receive it by instruction; nor can he reveal it, since he
is not himself the Son, unless he maintains that he is himself the Son. But you are not the

of the subject; for the giving of applause to me in opposition to you is not the act of
those who agree with you, but of those who agree with me, to whom they gave the applause
for having spoken the truth. But since God, who is just, judges the mind of each one—a
doctrine which you affirm to be true—He would not have wished this to be given through
the left hand to those on the right hand, exactly as the man who receives anything from a
robber is himself guilty. So that, on this account, He did not wish them to receive what is
brought by you; but they are to receive the revelation through the Son, who has been set
apart for this work. For to whom is it reasonable that the Father should give a revelation,
but to His only Son, because He knows Him to be worthy of such a revelation? And so this

said. For when one talks a great deal he sometimes hits the truth, not knowing what he is
saying. I am referring to the statement which he uttered, ‘No one knows the Father.’” And
Peter said: “Do not any longer profess that you know His doctrines.” And Simon said: “I
do not profess to believe his doctrines; but I am discussing points in which he was by accident
right.” And Peter said: “Not to give you any pretext for escape, I shall carry on the discussion
with you in the way you wish. At the same time, I call all to witness that you do not yet believe
the statement which you just now made. For I know your opinions. And in order that you
may not imagine that I am not speaking the truth, I shall expound your opinions, that you

<head>Chapter XII.—Simon’s Opinions Expounded by Peter.</head>
<p>“We, Simon, do not assert that from the great power, which is also called the dominant1382
power, two angels were sent forth, the one to create the world, the other to give the
law; nor that each one when he came proclaimed himself, on account of what he had done,
as the sole creator; nor that there is one who stands, will stand, and is opposed.1383 Learn
how you disbelieve even in respect to this subject. If you say that there is an unrevealed
power, that power is full of ignorance. For it did not foreknow the ingratitude of the angels
who were sent by it.” And Simon became exceedingly angry with Peter for saying this, and
interrupted his discourse, saying: “What nonsense is this you speak, you daring and most
impudent of men, revealing plainly before the multitudes the secret doctrines, so that they
can be easily learned?” And Peter said: “Why do you grudge that the present audience
should receive benefit?” And Simon said: “Do you then allow that such knowledge is a
benefit?” And Peter said: “I allow it: for the knowledge of a false doctrine is beneficial,
inasmuch as you do not fall into it because of ignorance.” And Simon said: “You are evidently
not able to reply to the propositions I laid before you. I maintain that even your
teacher affirms that there is some Father unrevealed.”</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Peter’s Explanation of the Passage.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “I shall reply to that which you wish me to speak of,—namely, the
passage, ‘No one knows the Father but the Son, nor does any one know the Son but the
Father, and they to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.’ First, then, I am astonished
that, while this statement admits of countless interpretations, you should have chosen the
very dangerous position of maintaining that the statement is made in reference to the ignorance
of the Creator (Demiurge), and all who are under him. For, first, the statement can
apply to all the Jews who think that David is the father of Christ, and that Christ himself is
his son, and do not know that He is the Son of God. Wherefore it is appropriately said, ‘No
one knows the Father,’ since, instead of God, they affirmed David to be His father; and the
additional remark, that no one knows even the Son, is quite correct, since they did not know
that He was the Son. The statement also, ‘to whomsoever the Son may wish to reveal Him,’
is also correct; for He being the Son from the beginning, was alone appointed to give the
revelation to those to whom He wishes to give it. And thus the first man (protoplast) Adam
must have heard of Him; and Enoch, who pleased God, must have known Him; and Noah,
the righteous one, must have become acquainted with Him; and Abraam His friend must
have understood Him; and Isaac must have perceived Him; and Jacob, who wrestled with
Him, must have believed in Him; and the revelation must have been given to all among the
people who were worthy.</p>

<p>“But if, as you say, it will be possible to know Him, because He is now revealed to all

not know Him, who were the seven pillars of the world, and who were able to please the
most just God, and that so many now from all nations who were impious know Him in
every respect? Were not those who were superior to every one not deemed worthy to know
Him?1385 And how can that be good which is not just? unless you wish to give the name
of ‘good,’ not to him who does good to those who act justly, but to him who loves the unjust,
even though they do not believe, and reveals to them the secrets which he would not reveal
to the just. But such conduct is befitting neither in one who is good nor just, but in one
who has come to hate the pious. Are not you, Simon, the standing one, who have the

<p>And Simon, being vexed at this, said: “Blame your own teacher, who said, ‘I thank Thee,
Lord of heaven and earth, that what was concealed from the wise, Thou hast revealed to
suckling babes.’”1386 And Peter said: “This is not the way in which the statement was made;
but I shall speak of it as if it had been made in the way that has seemed good to you. Our
Lord, even if He had made this statement, ‘What was concealed from the wise, the Father
revealed to babes,’ could not even thus be thought to point out another God and Father in
addition to Him who created the world. For it is possible that the concealed things of which
He spoke may be those of the Creator (Demiurge) himself; because Isaiah1387 says, ‘I will
open my mouth in parables, and I will belch forth things concealed from the foundation of
the world.’ Do you allow, then, that the prophet was not ignorant of the things concealed,
which Jesus says were concealed from the wise, but revealed to babes? And how was the
Creator (Demiurge) ignorant of them, if his prophet Isaiah was not ignorant of them? But
our Jesus did not in reality say ‘what was concealed,’ but He said what seems a harsher
statement; for He said, ‘Thou hast concealed these things from the wise, and1388 hast revealed
them to sucking babes.’ Now the word ‘Thou hast concealed’ implies that they had once
been known to them; for the key of the kingdom of heaven, that is, the knowledge of the
secrets, lay with them.</p>

Far be such a supposition from us. For He did not act impiously; but since they hid the
knowledge of the kingdom,1389 and neither themselves entered nor allowed those who
wished to enter, on this account, and justly, inasmuch as they hid the ways from those who
wished, were in like manner the secrets hidden from them, in order that they themselves
might experience what they had done to others, and with what measure they had measured,
an equal measure might be meted out to them.1390 For to him who is worthy to know, is
due that which he does not know; but from him who is not worthy, even should he seem to
have any thing it is taken away,1391 even if he be wise in other matters; and it is given to the

them, but that the way that leads to the kingdom, that is, the mode of life, had not been hid
from them. Wherefore it is that He says, ‘For say not that the way has been hid from me.’
But by the way is meant the mode of life; for Moses says,1393 ‘Behold, I have set before thy
face the way of life and the way of death.’ And the Teacher spoke in harmony with this:1394
‘Enter ye through the strait and narrow way, through which ye shall enter into life.’ And

<p>“From the circumstance that Isaiah said, in the person of God,1396 ‘But Israel hath not

another God besides Him who is known;1397 but he meant that the known God was
in another sense unknown, because the people sinned, being ignorant of the just character
of the known God, and imagined that they would not be punished by the good God.
Wherefore, after he said, ‘But Israel hath not known me, and the people hath not understood
me,’ he adds, ‘Alas! a sinful nation, a people laden with sins.’ For, not being afraid, in consequence
of their ignorance of His justice, as I said, they became laden with sins, supposing
that He was merely good, and would not therefore punish them for their sins.</p>

<p>“And some sinned thus, on account of imagining that there would be no judgment1398

of the Scriptures which are against God, and are unjust and false, to be true, they did not
know His real divinity and power. Therefore, in the belief that He was ignorant and rejoiced
in murder, and let off the wicked in consequence of the gifts of sacrifices; yea, moreover,
that He deceived and spake falsely, and did every thing that is unjust, they themselves did
things like to what their God did, and thus sinning, asserted that they were acting piously.
Wherefore it was impossible for them to change to the better, and when warned they took
no heed. For they were not afraid, since they became like their God through such actions.</p>

Son, as no one knoweth even the Son, but the Father.’ And reasonably. For if they had

error more distinctly to them, ‘On this account ye do err, not knowing the true things of
the Scriptures, on which account ye are ignorant also of the power of God.’1399 Wherefore

should work signs and miracles, even though he should lighten brilliantly in the air, or

Peter said: “I know how you were then astonished when you heard me say, ‘Whosoever
says anything whatever against God who created the world, I do not believe him.’ But listen
now to something additional, and greater than this. If God who created the world has in
reality such a character as the Scriptures assign Him, and if somehow or other He is incomparably
wicked, more wicked1400 than either the Scriptures were able to represent Him, or
any other can even conceive Him to be, nevertheless1401 I shall not give up worshipping
Him alone, and doing His will. For I wish you to know and to be convinced, that he who
has not affection for his own Creator, can never have it towards another. And if he has it
towards another, he has it contrary to nature, and he is ignorant that he has this passion for
the unjust from the evil one. Nor will he be able to retain even it stedfastly. And, indeed,
if there is another above the Creator (Demiurge), he will welcome me, since he is good, all
the more that I love my own Father; and he will not welcome you, as he knows that you
have abandoned your own natural Creator: for I do not call Him Father, influenced by a
greater hope, and not caring for what is reasonable. Thus, even if you find one who is superior
to Him, he knows that you will one day abandon him; and the more so that he has
not been your father, since you have abandoned Him who was really your Father.</p>

of your mind is one inclined to ingratitude. But if, knowing you to be ungrateful, He welcomes
you, and knowing me to be grateful, He does not receive me, He is inconsiderate,
according to your own assertion, and does not act reasonably. And thus, Simon, you are
not aware that you are the servant of wickedness.” And Simon answered: “Whence, then,
has evil arisen? tell us.” And Peter said: “Since to-day you were the first to go out, and you
declared that you would not in future listen to me as being a blasphemer, come to-morrow,
if indeed you wish to learn, and I shall explain the matter to you, and I will permit you to

with him went out along with him; but, falling at Peter’s feet, they begged that they might
be pardoned for having been carried away with Simon, and on repenting, to be welcomed.

Wherefore I allow that the evil one exists, because my Teacher, who spoke the truth in all
things, has frequently asserted that he exists. For instance, then, he acknowledges that he
conversed with Him, and tempted Him for forty days.1404 And I know that He has said
somewhere else, ‘If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then is his
kingdom to stand?’1405 And He pointed out that He saw the evil one like lightning falling
down from heaven.1406 And elsewhere He said, ‘He who sowed the bad seed is the devil.’1407
And again, ‘Give no pretext to the evil one.’1408 Moreover, in giving advice, He said, ‘Let
your yea be yea, and your nay nay; for what is more than these is of the evil one.’1409 Also,
in the prayer which He delivered to us, we have it said, ‘Deliver us from the evil one.’1410
And in another place, He promised that He would say to those who are impious, ‘Go ye into
outer darkness, which the Father prepared for the devil and his angels.’1411 And not to
prolong this statement further, I know that my Teacher often said that there is an evil one.

if I do not dare to affirm what has not been written. But if you say that it has been written,
prove it. But if, since it has not been written, you cannot prove it, why should we run risk
in stating our opinions in regard to what has not been written? For if we discourse too
daringly in regard to God, it is either because we do not believe that we shall be judged, or
that we shall be judged only in respect to that which we do, but not also in regard to what
we believe and speak.”1413 But Simon, understanding that Peter referred to his own madness,
said: “Permit me to run the risk; but do not you make what you assert to be blasphemy a
pretext for retiring. For I perceive that you wish to withdraw, in order that you may escape
refutation before the masses, sometimes as if you were afraid to listen to blasphemies, and
at other times by maintaining that, as nothing has been written as to how, and by whom,
and why the evil one came into existence, we ought not to dare to assert more than the
Scripture. Wherefore also as a pious man you affirm this only, that he exists. But by these
contrivances you deceive yourself, not knowing that, if it is blasphemy to inquire accurately
regarding the evil one, the blame rests with me, the accuser, and not with you, the defender
of God. And if the subject inquired into is not in Scripture,1414 and on this account you do
not wish to inquire into it, there are some satisfactory methods which can prove to you what
is sought not less effectively than the Scriptures. For instance, must it not be the case that

proved that he was not created, inasmuch as he existed for ever, not even is the Creator to
be blamed in this respect, since He is better than all others, even if He has not been able to
put an end to a being who had no beginning, because his nature did not admit of it; or if,
being able, He does not make away with him, deeming it unjust to put an end to that which
did not receive a beginning, and pardoning that which was by nature wicked, because he
could not have become anything else, even if he were to wish to do so.1419 But if, wishing

And Peter said: “But you, as being wicked, and hating God whom you have not known,
utter blasphemous words.” And Simon said: “Remember that you have likened me to the
author of evil.” And Peter said: “I confess it, I was wrong in comparing you to the evil one;
for I was compelled to do so, because I have not found one who is your equal, or worse than
you. For this reason I likened you to the evil one; for you happen to be much more wicked
than the author of evil. For no one can prove that the evil one spoke against God; but all of
us who are present see you speaking daringly against Him.” And Simon said: “He who
seeks the truth ought not to gratify any one in any respect contrary to what is really true.
For why does he make the inquiry at all? Why, I ask? for I am not also able, laying aside the
accurate investigation of things, to spend all my time in the praise of that God whom I do
not know.”1420</p>

<p>And Peter said: “You are not so blessed as to praise Him, nor indeed can you do such
a good deed as this; for then you would be full of Him. For thus said our Teacher, who always
spoke the truth: ‘Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.’1421 Whence you,
abounding in evil purposes, through ignorance speak against the only good God. And not
yet suffering what you deserve to suffer for the words which you have dared to utter,1422
you either imagine that there will be no judgment, or perchance you think that there is not
even a God. Whence, not comprehending such long-suffering as His, you are moving on
to still greater madness.” And Simon said: “Do not imagine that you will frighten me into
not investigating the truth of your examples. For I am so eager for the truth, that for its
sake I will not shrink from undergoing danger. If, then, you have anything to say in regard
to the propositions made by me at the commencement, say it now.”</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Peter Undertakes to Discuss the Devil’s Origin.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “Since you compel us, after we have made accurate investigations into
the contrivances of God, to venture to state them, and that, too, to men who are not able to
comprehend thoroughly the contrivances of their fellow-men, for the sake at least of those
who are present, I, instead of remaining silent—a course which would be most pious—shall
discuss the subjects of which you wish me to speak. I agree with you in believing that there
is a prince of evil, of whose origin the Scripture has ventured to say nothing either true or
false. But let us follow out the inquiry in many ways, as to how he has come into existence,
if it is the fact that he has come into existence; and of the opinions which present themselves,
let us select that which is most reverential, since in the case of probable opinions, that one
is assumed with confidence which is based on the principle that we ought to attribute to God
that which is more reverential; and all the more so, if, when all other suppositions are removed,
there still remains one which is adequate and involves less danger.1423 But I
promise you, before I proceed with the investigation, that every method in the investigation
can show that God alone is blameless.</p>

<p>“But, as you said, if the evil one is created either he has been begotten as an animal, or
he has been sent forth substantially by Him,1424 or he has been compounded externally, or
his will has arisen through composition; or it happened that he came into existence from
things non-existent, without composition and the will of God; or he has been made by God
from that which in no manner and nowhere exists; or the matter, being lifeless or living,
from which he has arisen was outside of God; or he fashioned himself, or he was made by
God, or he is a relative thing, or he ever existed: for we cannot say that he does not exist,
since we have agreed in thinking that he does exist.” And Simon said: “Well have you distinguished
all the methods of accounting for his existence in a summary manner. Now it
is my part to examine these various ideas, and to show that the Creator is blameable. But
it is your business to prove, as you promised, that he is free from all blame. But I wonder
if you will be able. For, first, if the devil has been begotten from God as an animal, the vice
which is his is accordingly the same as that of him who sends him forth.” And Peter said:
“Not at all. For we see many men who are good the fathers of wicked children, and others
who are wicked the fathers of good children, and others again who are wicked producing
both good and wicked1425 children, and others who are good having both wicked and good
children. For instance, the first man who was created produced the unrighteous Cain and
the righteous Abel.” To this Simon said: “You are acting foolishly, in using human examples
when discoursing about God.” And Peter said: “Speak you, then, to us about God without
using human examples, and yet so that what you say can be understood; but you are not
able to do so.</p>

you, from the example which you yourself adduced, that wicked beings come from good,
and good from wicked, you did not admit the argument, for you said that the example was
a human one. Wherefore I now do not admit that the term ‘being begotten’1426 can be used
with reference to God; for it is characteristic of man, and not of God, to beget. Not only so;
but God cannot be good or evil, just or unjust. Nor indeed can He have intelligence, or life,
or any of the other attributes which can exist in man; for all these are peculiar to man. And
if we must not, in our investigations in regard to God, give Him the good attributes which
belong to man, it is not possible for us to have any thought or make any statement in regard
to God; but all we can do is to investigate One point alone,—namely, what is His will which
He has Himself allowed us to apprehend, in order that, being judged, we might be without

and to speak of His substance. I mean from the good attributes that belong to man. For
instance, life and death are attributes of man; but death is not an attribute of God, but life,
and eternal life. Furthermore, men may be both evil and good; but God can be only incomparably
good. And, not to prolong the subject too much, the better attributes of man are
eternal attributes of God.” And Peter said: “Tell me, Simon, is it an attribute of man to
beget evil and good, and to do evil and good?” And Simon said: “It is.” And Peter said:
“Since you made this assertion, we must assign the better attributes of man to God; and so,
while men beget evil and good, God can beget good only; and while men do evil and good,
God rejoices only in doing good. Thus, with regard to God, we must either not predicate
any of the attributes of man and be silent, or it is reasonable that we should assign the best
of the good attributes to Him. And thus He alone is the cause of all good things.”</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—God Produced the Wicked One, But Not Evil.</head>
<p>And Simon said: “If, then, God is the cause only of what is good, what else can we think
than that some other principle begot the evil one;1427 or is evil unbegotten?” And Peter
said: “No other power begot the wicked one, nor is evil unbegotten, as I shall show in the
conclusion; for now my object is to prove, as I promised in the commencement, that God
is blameless in every1428 respect. We have granted, then, that God possesses in an incomparable
way the better attributes that belong to men. Wherefore also it is possible for Him
to have been the producer of the four substances,—heat, I mean, and cold, moist and dry.
These, as being at first simple and unmixed, were naturally indifferent in their desire;1429
but being produced by God, and mixed externally, they would naturally become a living
being, possessing the free choice to destroy those who are evil. And thus, since all things
have been begotten from Him, the wicked one is from no other source. Nor has he derived
his evil from the God who has created all things (with whom it is impossible that evil should
exist), because the substances were produced by Him in a state of indifference, and carefully
separated from each other; and when they were externally blended through his art, there
arose through volition the desire for the destruction of the evil ones. But the good cannot
be destroyed by the evil that arose, even though it should wish to do so: for it exercises its
power only1430 against those who sin. Ignorant, then, of the character of each,1431 he makes
his attempt against him, and convicting him, he punishes him.” And Simon said: “God
being able to mingle the elements, and to make His mixtures so as to produce any dispositions
that He may wish, why did He not make the composition of each such as that it would prefer
what is good?”</p>

when we have finished the subject now in hand. Then I shall show how and on account of
what he came into being, and I shall fully convince you that his Creator is blameless.1432
We said, then, that the four substances were produced by God. And thus, through the volition
of Him who mingled them, arose, as He wished, the choice of evils. For if it had arisen
contrary to His determination, or from some other substance or cause, then God would not
have had firmness of will: for perchance, even though He should not wish it, leaders of evil
might continually arise, who would war against His wishes. But it is impossible that this
should be the case. For no living being, and especially one capable of giving guidance, can
arise from accident: for everything that is produced must be produced by some one.”</p>

impassible is blessed; but what is blessed cannot be receptive of hatred, since, on account
of its eternal creation,1433 it does not fear that it will be deprived of anything. But how does
not matter rather love the Creator, when1434 it evidently sends forth its fruits to nourish all
who are made by Him? And how does it not fear Him as superior, as trembling through
earthquakes it confesses, and as, though its billows ran high, yet, when the Teacher was
sailing on it and commanded a calm, it immediately obeyed and became still?1435 What!

<head>Chapter XV.—Sin the Cause of Evil.</head>
<p>And Simon said: “But what if, being lifeless, it possesses a nature capable of producing
what is evil and what is good?” And Peter said: “According to this statement, it is neither
good nor evil, because it does not act by free choice, being lifeless and insensible. Wherefore
it is possible to perceive distinctly in this matter, how, being lifeless, it produces as if it were
living;1437 and being insensible, it yet plainly fashions artistic shapes both in animals and
plants.” And Simon said: “What! if God Himself gave it life, is not He, then, the cause of
the evils which it produces?” And Peter said: “If God gave it life according to His own will,
then it is His Spirit that produces it, and no longer is it anything hostile to God, or of equal
power with Him; or it is impossible that everything made by Him is made according as He
wishes. But you will say, He Himself is the cause of evil, since He Himself produces the evils
through it. What sort, then, are the evils of which you speak? Poisonous serpents and deadly
plants, or demons, or any other of those things that can disturb men?—which things would
not have been injurious had not man sinned, for which reason1438 death came in. For if
man were sinless, the poison of serpents would have no effect, nor the activities of injurious
plants, nor would there be the disturbances of demons, nor would man naturally have any
other suffering; but losing his immortality on account of his sin, he has become, as I said,
capable of every suffering. But if you say, Why, then, was the nature of man made at the
beginning capable of death? I tell you, because of free-will; for if we were not capable of
death, we could not, as being immortal, be punished on account of our voluntary sin.1439
And thus, on account of our freedom from suffering, righteousness would be still more
weakened if we were wicked by choice; for those who should have evil purposes could not
be punished, on account of their being incapable of suffering.1440</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Why the Wicked One is Entrusted with Power.</head>
<p>And Simon said to this: “I have one thing more to say in regard to the wicked one.
Assuredly, since God made him out of nothing, he is in this respect wicked,1441 especially
since he was able to make him good, by giving him at his creation a nature in no way capable
of selecting wickedness.” And Peter said: “The statement that He created him out of
nothing, with a power of choice, is like the statement we have made above, that, having
made such a constitution as can rejoice in evils, He Himself appears to be the cause of what
took place. But since there is one explanation of both statements, we shall show afterwards
why it was that He made him rejoice in the destruction of the wicked.” And Simon said:
“If he made the angels also voluntary agents, and the wicked one departed from a state of
righteousness, why has he been honoured with a post of command? Is it not plain that he
who thus honoured him takes pleasure in the wicked, in that he has thus honoured him?”1442
And Peter said: “If God set him by law, when he rebelled, to rule over those who were like
him, ordering him to inflict punishment on those who sin, He is not unjust. But if it be the
case that He has honoured him even after his revolt, He who honoured him saw beforehand
his usefulness; for the honour is temporary, and it is right that the wicked should be ruled
by the wicked one, and that sinners should be punished by him.”</p>

<p>And Simon said: “If, then, he exists for ever, is not the fact of the sole government of
God thus destroyed, since there is another power, namely, that concerned with matter, which
rules along with Him?” And Peter said: “If they are different in their substances, they are
different also in their powers, and the superior rules the inferior. But if they are of the same
substance, then they are equal in power, and they are in like manner good or bad. But it is
plain that they are not equal in power; for the Creator put matter into that shape of a world
into which He willed to put it. Is it then at all possible to maintain that it always existed,
being a substance; and is not matter, as it were, the storehouse of God? For it is not possible
to maintain that there was a time1443 when God possessed nothing, but He always was the
only ruler of it. Wherefore also He is an eternal sole ruler;1444 and on this account it would
justly be said to belong to Him who exists, and rules, and is eternal.”1445 And Simon said:
“What then? Did the wicked one make himself? And was God good in such a way, that,
knowing he would be the cause of evil, he yet did not destroy him at his origination, when
he could have been destroyed, as not yet being perfectly made? For if he came into being
suddenly and complete, then on that account1446 he is at war with the Creator, as having
come suddenly into being, possessed of equal power with him.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Is the Devil a Relation?</head>
<p>And Peter said: “What you state is impossible; for if he came into existence by degrees,
He could have cut him off as a foe by His own free choice. And knowing beforehand that
he was coming into existence, He would not have allowed him as a good, had He not known
that by reason of him what was useful was being brought into existence.1447 And he could
not have come into existence suddenly, complete, of his own power. For he who did not
exist could not fashion himself; and he neither could become complete out of nothing, nor
could any one justly say that he had substance,1448 so as always to be equal in power if he
were begotten.” And Simon said: “Is he then a mere relation, and in this way
wicked?1449—being injurious, as water is injurious to fire, but good for the seasonably thirsty
land; as iron is good for the cultivation of the land, but bad for murders; and lust is not evil
in respect of marriage, but bad in respect of adultery; as murder is an evil, but good for the
murderer so far as his purpose is concerned; and cheating is an evil, but pleasant to the man
who cheats; and other things of a like character are good and bad in like manner. In this
way, neither is evil, nor good; for the one produces the other. For does not that which seems
to be done injuriously rejoice the doer, but punish the sufferer? And though it seems unjust
that a man should, out of self-love, gratify himself by every means in his power, to whom,
on the other hand, does it not seem unjust that a man should suffer severe punishments at
the hand of a just judge for having loved himself?”</p>
<note type="footnote">1447 The editors punctuate differently, thus: “And knowing beforehand that he was becoming not good, He

<head>Chapter XIX.—Some Actions Really Wicked.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “A man ought to punish himself through self-restraint,1450 when his
lust wishes to hurry on to the injury of another, knowing that1451the wicked one can destroy
the wicked, for he has received power over them from the beginning. And not yet is this
an evil to those who have done evil; but that their souls should remain punished after the
destruction, you are right in thinking to be really harsh, though the man who has been foreordained
for evil should say that it is right.1452 Wherefore, as I said, we ought to avoid doing
injury1453 to another for the sake of a short lived pleasure, that we may not involve ourselves
in eternal punishment for the sake of a little pleasure.” And Simon said: “Is it the case,
then, that there is nothing either bad or good by nature, but the difference arises through
law and custom? For is it not1454 the habit of the Persians to marry their own mothers, sisters
and daughters, while marriage with other women is prohibited1455 as most barbarous?
Wherefore, if it is not settled what things are evil, it is not possible for all to look forward
to the judgment of God.” And Peter said: “This cannot hold; for it is plain to all that cohabitation
with mothers is abominable, even though the Persians, who are a mere fraction of
the whole, should under the effects of a bad custom fail to see the iniquity of their abominable
conduct. Thus also the Britons publicly cohabit in the sight of all, and are not ashamed;
and some men eat the flesh of others, and feel no disgust; and others eat the flesh of dogs;
and others practice other unmentionable deeds. Thus, then we ought not to form our
judgments with a perception which through habit has been perverted from its natural action.
For to be murdered is an evil, even if all were to deny it; for no one wishes to suffer it himself,
and in the case of theft1456 no one rejoices at his own punishment. If, then, no one1457 were
at all ever to confess that these are sins, it is right even then to look forward of necessity to
a judgment in regard to sins.” When Peter said this, Simon answered: “Does this, then,
seem to you to be the truth in regard to the wicked one? Tell me.”</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Pain and Death the Result of Sin.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “We remember that our Lord and Teacher, commanding us, said, ‘Keep
the mysteries for me and the sons of my house.’ Wherefore also He explained to His disciples
privately the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.1458 But to you who do battle with us,
and examine into nothing else but our statements, whether they be true or false, it would
be impious to state the hidden truths. But that none of the bystanders may imagine that I
am contriving excuses,1459 because I am unable to reply to the assertions made by you, I
shall answer you by first putting the question, If there had been a state of painlessness, what
is the meaning of the statement, ‘The evil one was?’” And Simon said: “The words have no
meaning.” And Peter: “Is then evil the same as pain and death?” And Simon: “It seems
so.” And Peter said: “Evil, then, does not exist always, yea, it cannot even exist at all substantially;
for pain and death belong to the class of accidents, neither of which can co-exist
with abiding strength. For what is pain but the interruption of harmony? And what is death
but the separation of soul from body? There is therefore no pain when there is harmony.
For death does not even at all belong to those things which substantially exist: for death is
nothing, as I said, but the separation of soul from body; and when this takes place, the body,
which is by nature incapable of sensation, is dissolved; but the soul, being capable of sensation,
remains in life and exists substantially. Hence, when there is harmony there is no pain,
no death, no, not even deadly plants nor poisonous reptiles, nor anything of such a nature
that its end is death. And hence, where immortality reigns, all things will appear to have
been made with reason. And this will be the case when, on account of righteousness, man
becomes immortal through the prevalence of the peaceful reign of Christ, when his composition
will be so well arranged as not to give rise1460to sharp impulses; and his knowledge,
moreover, will be unerring, so as that he shall not mistake1461evil for good; and he will suffer
no pain, so that he will not be mortal.”1462</p>

grief, and the like?” And Peter said: “Yes, these belong to the things that are accidental, not
to those that always exist, and it will be found that they now occur with advantage to the
soul. For lust has, by the will of Him who created all things well, been made to arise within
the living being, that, led by it to intercourse, he may increase humanity, from a selection
of which a multitude of superior beings arise who are fit for eternal life. But if it were not
for lust, no one would trouble himself with intercourse with his wife; but now, for the sake
of pleasure, and, as it were, gratifying himself, man carries out His will. Now, if a man uses
lust for lawful marriage, he does not act impiously; but if he rushes to adultery, he acts impiously,
and he is punished because he makes a bad use of a good ordinance. And in the
same way, anger has been made by God to be lighted up naturally within us, in order that
we may be induced by it to ward off injuries. Yet if any one indulges it without restraint,
he acts unjustly; but if he uses it within due bounds, he does what is right. Moreover, we
are capable of grief, that we may be moved with sympathy at the death of relatives, of a wife,
or children, or brothers, or parents, or friends, or some others, since, if we were not capable
of sympathy, we should be inhuman. In like manner, all the other affections will be found
to be adapted for us, if at least the reason for their existence1464 be considered.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Sins of Ignorance.</head>
<p>And Simon: “Why is it, then, that some die prematurely, and periodical diseases arise;
and that there are, moreover, attacks of demons, and of madness, and all other kinds of afflictions
which can greatly punish?” And Peter said: “Because men, following their own
pleasure in all things, cohabit without observing the proper times; and thus the deposition
of seed, taking place unseasonably, naturally produces a multitude of evils. For they ought
to reflect, that as a season has been fixed suitable for planting and sowing,1465 so days have
been appointed as appropriate for cohabitation, which are carefully to be observed. Accordingly
some one well instructed in the doctrines taught by Moses, finding fault with the people
for their sins, called them sons of the new moons and the sabbaths.1466 Yet in the beginning
of the world men lived long, and had no diseases. But when through carelessness they
neglected the observation of the proper times, then the sons in succession cohabiting through
ignorance at times when1467 they ought not, place their children under innumerable afflictions.
Whence our Teacher, when we inquired of Him1468 in regard to the man who was
blind from his birth, and recovered his sight, if this man sinned, or his parents, that he
should be born blind, answered, ‘Neither did he sin at all, nor his parents, but that the power
of God might be made manifest through him in healing the sins of ignorance.’1469 And, in
truth, such afflictions arise because of ignorance; as, for instance, by not knowing when one
ought to cohabit with his wife, as if she be pure from her discharge. Now the afflictions
which you mentioned before are the result of ignorance, and not, assuredly, of any wickedness
that has been perpetrated. Moreover, give me the man who sins not, and I will show you
the man who suffers not; and you will find that he not only does not suffer himself, but that
he is able1470 to heal others. For instance, Moses, on account of his piety, continued free
from suffering all his life, and by his prayers he healed the Egyptians when they suffered on
account of their sins.”</p>

<p>And Simon said: “Let me grant that this is the case: does not the inequality of lot
amongst men seem to you most unjust? For one is in penury, another is rich; one is sick,
another is in good health: and there are innumerable differences of a like character in human
life.”1471 And Peter said: “Do you not perceive, Simon, that you are again shooting your
observations beyond the mark? For while we were discussing evil, you have made a digression,
and introduced the question of the anomalies that appear in this world. But I shall
speak even to this point. The world is an instrument artistically contrived, that for the male
who is to exist eternally, the female may bear eternal righteous sons. Now they could not
have been rendered perfectly pious here, had there been no needy ones for them to help.
In like manner there are the sick, that they may have objects for their care. And the other
afflictions admit of a like explanation.” And Simon said: “Are not those in humble circumstances
unfortunate? for they are subjected to distress, that others may be made righteous.”
And Peter said: “If their humiliation were eternal, their misfortune would be very great.
But the humiliations and exaltations of men take place according to lot; and he who is not
pleased with his lot can appeal,1472 and by trying his case according to law, he can exchange
his mode of life for another.” And Simon said: “What do you mean by this lot and this
appeal?” And Peter said: “You are now demanding the exposition of another topic; but if
you permit me, we can show you how, being born again, and changing your origin, and
living according to law, you will obtain eternal salvation.”</p>

<p>And Simon hearing this, said: “Do not imagine that, when I, while questioning you,
agreed with you in each topic, I went to the next, as being fully assured of the truth of the
previous; but I appeared to yield to your ignorance, that you might go on to the next topic,
in order that, becoming acquainted with the whole range of your ignorance, I might condemn
you, not through mere conjecture, but from full knowledge.1473 Allow me now to retire
for three days, and I shall come back and show that you know nothing.” When Simon said
this, and was on the point of going out, my father said: “Listen to me, Simon, for a moment,
and then go wherever you like. I remember that in the beginning, before the discussion,
you accused me of being prejudiced, though as yet you had no experience of me. But now,
having heard you discuss in turn, and judging that Peter has the advantage, and now assigning
to him the merit of speaking the truth, do I appear to you to judge correctly, and with
knowledge;1474 or is it not so? For if you should say that I have judged correctly, but do not
agree, then you are plainly prejudiced, inasmuch as you do not wish to agree, after confessing
your defeat. But if I was not correct in maintaining that Peter has the advantage in the discussion,
do you convince us how we have not judged correctly, or you will cease1475 to discuss
with him before all, since you will always be defeated and agree, and in consequence your
own soul will suffer pain, condemned as you will be, and in disgrace, through your own
conscience, even if you do not feel shame before all the listeners as the greatest torture; for
we have seen you conquered, in fact, and we have heard your own lips confess it. Finally,

<p>And Simon hearing this, gnashed his teeth for rage, and went away in silence. But Peter
(for a considerable portion of the day still remained) laid his hands on the large multitude
to heal them; and having dismissed them, went into the house with his more intimate friends,
and sat down. And one of his attendants, of the name of Sophonias, said: “Blessed is God,
O Peter, who selected you and instructed1477 you for the comfort of the good. For, in truth,
you discussed with Simon with dignity and great patience. But we beg of you to discourse
to us of evil; for we expect that you will state to us your own genuine belief in regard to
it,—not, however at the present moment, but to-morrow, if it seems good to you: for we
spare you, because of the fatigue you feel on account of your discussion.” And Peter said:
“I wish you to know, that he who does anything with pleasure, finds rest in the very toils
themselves; but he who does not do what he wishes, is rendered exceedingly weary by the
very rest he takes. Wherefore you confer on me a great rest when you make me discourse
on topics which please me.” Content, then, with his disposition, and sparing him on account
of his fatigue, we requested him to put the discussion off till the night, when it was his custom
to discourse to his genuine friends. And partaking of salt, we turned to sleep.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Two Ages.</head>
<p>And Peter said: “Listen, therefore, to the truth of the harmony in regard to the evil one.
God appointed two kingdoms, and established two ages, determining that the present world
should be given to the evil one, because it is small, and passes quickly away; but He promised
to preserve for the good one the age to come, as it will be great and eternal. Man, therefore,
He created with free-will, and possessing the capability of inclining to whatever actions he
wishes. And his body consists of three parts, deriving its origin from the female; for it has
lust, anger, and grief, and what is consequent on these. But the spirit not being uniform,1480
but consisting of three parts, derives its origin from the male; and it is capable of reasoning,
knowledge, and fear, and what is consequent on these. And each of these triads has one
root, so that man is a compound of two mixtures, the female and the male. Wherefore also
two ways have been laid before him—those of obedience and disobedience to law; and two
kingdoms, have been established,—the one called1481 the kingdom of heaven, and the other
the kingdom of those who are now kings upon earth. Also two kings have been appointed,
of whom the one is selected to rule by law over the present and transitory world, and his
composition is such that he rejoices in the destruction of the wicked. But the other and
good1482 one, who is the King of the age to come, loves the whole nature of man; but not
being able to have boldness in the present world, he counsels what is advantageous, like one
who tries to conceal who he really is.1483</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Work of the Good One and of the Evil One.</head>
<p>“But of these two, the one1484 acts violently towards the other by the command of God.
Moreover, each man has power to obey whichever of them he pleases for the doing of good
or evil. But if any one chooses to do what is good, he becomes the possession of the future
good king; but if any one should do evil, he becomes the servant of the present evil one,
who, having received power over him by just judgment on account of his sins, and wishing
to use it1485 before the coming age, rejoices in punishing him in the present life, and thus
by gratifying, as it were, his own private passion, he accomplishes the will of God. But the
other, being made to rejoice in power over the righteous, when he finds a righteous man,
is exceedingly glad, and saves him with eternal life; and he also, as if gratifying himself, traces
the gratification which he feels on account of these to God. Now it is within the power of
every unrighteous man to repent and be saved; and every righteous man may have to undergo
punishment for sins committed at the end of his career. Moreover, these two leaders are
the swift hands of God, eager to anticipate Him so as to accomplish His will. But that this
is so, has been said even by the law in the person of God: ‘I will kill, and I will make alive;
I will strike, and I will heal.’1486 For, in truth, He kills and makes alive. He kills through
the left hand, that is, through the evil one, who has been so composed as to rejoice in afflicting
the impious. And he saves and benefits through the right hand, that is, through the good
one, who has been made to rejoice in the good deeds and salvation of the righteous. Now
these have not their substances outside of God: for there is no other primal source. Nor,
indeed, have they been sent forth as animals from God, for they were of the same mind with
Him; nor are they accidental,1487 arising spontaneously in opposition to His will, since thus
the greatest exercise of His power would have been destroyed. But from God have been
sent forth the four first elements—heat and cold, moist and dry. In consequence of this,
He is the father of every substance, but not of the disposition1488 which may arise from the
combination of the elements; for when these were combined from without, disposition was
begotten in them as a child. The wicked one, then, having served God blamelessly to the
end of the present world, can become good by a change in his composition,1489 since he
assuredly is not of one uniform substance whose sole bent is towards sin. For not even more
does he do evil, although he is evil, since he has received power to afflict lawfully.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Men Sin Through Ignorance.</head>
<p>When Peter said this, Micah, who was himself one of his followers, asked: “What, then,
is the reason why men sin?” And Peter said: “It is because they are ignorant that they will
without doubt be punished for their evil deeds when judgment takes place.1490 For this
reason they, having lust, as I elsewhere said, for the continuance of life, gratify it in any accidental
way, it may be by the vitiation of boys,1491 or by some other flattering sin. For in
consequence of their ignorance, as I said before, they are urged on through fearlessness to
satisfy their lust in an unlawful manner. Wherefore God is not evil, who has rightly placed
lust within man, that there may be a continuance of life, but they are most impious who
have used the good of lust badly. The same considerations apply to anger also, that if one
uses it righteously, as is within his power, he is pious; but going beyond measure, and taking
judgment to himself,1492 he is impious.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Sophonias Maintains that God Cannot Produce What is Unlike Himself.</head>
<p>And Sophonias said again: “Your great patience, my lord Peter, gives us boldness to
ask you many questions for the sake of accuracy. Wherefore we make our inquiries with
confidence in every direction. I remember, then, that Simon said yesterday, in his discussion
with you, that the evil one, if he was born of God, possesses in consequence the same substance
as He does who sent him forth, and he ought to have been good, and not wicked.
But you answered that this was not always the case, since many wicked sons are born of
good parents, as from Adam two unlike1493 sons were begotten, one of whom was bad and
the other good. And when Simon found fault with you for having used human examples,
you answered that in this way we ought not to admit that God begets at all; for this also is
a human example. And I, Sophonias, admit that God begets; but I do not allow that He
begets what is bad, even though the good among men beget bad children. And do not
imagine1494 that I am without reason attributing to God some of the qualities that distinguish
men, and refusing to attribute others, when I grant that He begets, but do not allow that He
begets what is unlike Himself. For men, as you might expect, beget sons who are unlike
them in their dispositions for the following reason. Being composed of four parts, they
change their bodies variously, according to the various changes of the year; and thus, the
appropriate change either of increase or decrease taking place in the human body, each
season destroys the harmonious combination. Now, when the combinations do not always
remain exactly in the same position, the seeds, having sometimes one combination, sometimes
another, are sent off; and these are followed, according to the combination belonging
to the season, by dispositions either good or bad. But in the case of God we cannot suppose
any such thing; for, being unchangeable and always existing, whenever He wishes to send
forth, there is an absolute necessity that what is sent forth should be in all respects in the
same position as that which has begotten, I mean in regard to substance and disposition.
But if any one should wish to maintain that He is changeable, I do not know how it is possible
for him to maintain that He is immortal.”</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—God’s Power of Changing Himself.</head>
<p>When Peter heard this, he thought for a little, and said: “I do not think that any one
can converse about evil without doing the will of the evil one. Therefore knowing this, I do
not know what I shall do, whether I shall be silent or speak. For if I be silent, I should incur
the laughter of the multitude, because, professing to proclaim the truth, I am ignorant of
the explanation of vice. But if I should state my opinion, I am afraid lest it be not at all
pleasing to God that we should seek after evil, for only seeking after good is pleasing to
Him. However, in my reply to the statements of Sophonias, I shall make my ideas more
plain. I then agree with him in thinking that we ought not to attribute to God all the qualities
of men. For instance, men not having bodies that are convertible are not converted; but
they have a nature that admits of alteration by the lapse of time through the seasons of the
year. But this is not the case with God; for through His inborn1495 Spirit He becomes, by
a power which cannot be described, whatever body He likes. And one can the more easily
believe this, as the air, which has received such a nature from Him, is converted into dew
by the incorporeal mind permeating it, and being thickened becomes water, and water being
compacted becomes stone and earth, and stones through collision light up fire. According
to such1496 a change and conversion, air becomes first water, and ends in being fire through
conversions, and the moist is converted into its natural opposite. Why? Did not God convert
the rod of Moses into an animal, making it a serpent,1497 which He reconverted into a rod?
And by means of this very converted rod he converted the water of the Nile1498 into blood,
which again he reconverted into water. Yea, even man, who is dust, He changed by the inbreathing
of His breath1499 into flesh, and changed him back again into dust.1500 And was
not Moses,1501 who himself was flesh, converted into the grandest light, so that the sons of
Israel could not look him in the face? Much more, then, is God completely able to convert
Himself into whatsoever He wishes.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Objection Answered, that One Cannot Change Himself.</head>
<p>“But perhaps some one of you thinks that one may become something under the influence
of one, and another under the influence of another, but no one can change himself
into whatever he wishes, and that it is the characteristic of one who grows old, and who
must die according to his nature,1502 to change, but we ought not to entertain such thoughts
of immortal beings. For were not angels, who are free from old age, and of a fiery substance,
1503 changed into flesh,—those, for instance, who received the hospitality of Abraham,
1504 whose feet men washed, as if they were the feet of men of like substance?1505 Yea,
moreover, with Jacob,1506 who was a man, there wrestled an angel, converted into flesh that
he might be able to come to close quarters with him. And, in like manner, after he had
wrestled by his own will, he was converted into his own natural form; and now, when he
was changed into fire, he did not burn up the broad sinew of Jacob, but he inflamed it, and
made him lame. Now, that which cannot become anything else, whatever it may wish, is
mortal, inasmuch as it is subject to its own nature; but he who can become whatever he
wishes, whenever he wishes, is immortal, returning to a new condition, inasmuch as he has
control over his own nature. Wherefore much more does the power of God change the
substance of the body into whatever He wishes and whenever He wishes; and by the change
that takes place1507 He sends forth what, on the one hand, is of similar substance, but, on
the other, is not of equal power. Whatever, then, he who sends forth turns into a different
substance, that he can again turn back into his own;1508 but he who is sent forth, arising in
consequence of the change which proceeds from him, and being his child, cannot become
anything else without the will of him who sent him forth, unless he wills it.”</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Origin of the Good One Different from that of the Evil One.</head>
<p>When Peter said this, Micah,1509 who was himself also one of the companions that attended
on him, said: “I also should like to learn from you if the good one has been produced
in the same way that the evil one came into being. But if they came into being in a similar
manner, then they are brothers in my opinion.” And Peter said: “They have not come into
being in a similar way: for no doubt you remember what I said in the beginning, that the
substance of the body of the wicked one, being fourfold in origin, was carefully selected and
sent forth by God; but when it was combined externally, according to the will of Him who
sent it forth, there arose, in consequence of the combination, the disposition which rejoices
in evils:1510 so that you may see that the substance, fourfold in origin, which was sent forth
by Him, and which also always exists, is the child of God; but that the accidentally arising
disposition which rejoices in evils has supervened when the substance1511 was combined
externally by him. And thus disposition has not been begotten by God, nor by any one else,
nor indeed has it been sent forth by Him, nor has it come forth spontaneously,1512 nor did
it always exist, like the substance before the combination; but it has come on as an accident
by external combination, according to the will of God. And we have often said that it must
be so. But the good one having been begotten from the most beautiful change of God, and
not having arisen accidentally through an external combination, is really His Son. Yet, since
these doctrines are unwritten, and are confirmed to us only by conjecture, let us by no means
deem it as absolutely certain that this is the true state of the case. For if we act otherwise,
our mind will cease from investigating the truth, in the belief that it has already fully comprehended
it. Remember these things, therefore; for I must not state such things to all, but
only to those who are found after trial most trustworthy. Nor ought we rashly to maintain
such assertions towards each other, nor ought ye to dare to speak as if you were accurately
acquainted with the discovery of secret truths, but you ought simply to reflect over them in
silence; for in stating, perchance, that a matter is so,1513 he who says it will err, and he will

<head>Chapter IX.—Why the Wicked One is Appointed Over the Wicked by the Righteous
God.</head>
<p>When Peter said this, Lazarus, who also was one of his followers, said: “Explain to us
the harmony, how it can be reasonable that the wicked one should be appointed by the
righteous God to be the punisher of the impious, and yet should himself afterwards be sent
into lower darkness along with his angels and with sinners: for I remember that the
Teacher Himself said this.”1514 And Peter said: “I indeed allow that the evil one does no
evil, inasmuch as he is accomplishing the law given to him. And although he has an evil
disposition, yet through fear of God he does nothing unjustly; but, accusing the teachers of
truth so as to entrap the unwary, he is himself named the accuser (the devil). But the statement
of our unerring Teacher, that he and his angels, along with the deluded sinners, shall
go into lower darkness, admits of the following explanation. The evil one, having obtained
the lot1515 of rejoicing in darkness according to his composition, delights to go down to the
darkness of Tartarus along with angels who are his fellow-slaves; for darkness is dear to fire.
But the souls of men, being drops of pure light, are absorbed by the substance fire, which
is of a different class; and not possessing a nature capable of dying, they are punished according
to their deserts. But if he who is the leader of men1516 into vice is not sent into darkness,
as not rejoicing in it, then his composition, which rejoices in evils, cannot be changed by
another combination into the disposition for good. And thus he will be adjudged to be with
the good,1517 all the more because, having obtained a composition which rejoices in evils,
through fear of God he has done nothing contrary to the decrees of the law of God. And
did not the Scripture by a mysterious hint1518 point out by the statement1519 that the rod
of the high priest Aaron became a serpent, and was again converted into a rod, that a change
in the composition of the wicked one would afterwards take place?”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Why Some Believe, and Others Do Not.</head>
<p>And after Lazarus, Joseph, who also was one of his followers, said: “You have spoken
all things rightly. Teach me also this, as I am eager to know it, why, when you give the same
discourses to all, some believe and others disbelieve?” And Peter said: “It is because my
discourses are not charms, so that every one that hears them must without hesitation believe
them. The fact that some believe, and others do not, points out to the intelligent the freedom
of the will.” And when he said this, we all blessed him.</p>

<p>And as we were going to take our meals,1520 some one ran in and said: “Appion Pleistonices
has just come with Annubion from Antioch, and he is lodging with Simon.” And
my father hearing this, and rejoicing, said to Peter: “If you permit me, I shall go to salute
Appion and Annubion, who have been my friends from childhood. For perchance I shall
persuade Annubion to discuss genesis with Clement.” And Peter said: “I permit you, and
I praise you for fulfilling the duties of a friend. But now consider how in the providence of
God there come together from all quarters considerations which contribute to your full assurance,
rendering the harmony complete. But I say this because the arrival of Annubion
happens advantageously for you.” And my father: “In truth, I see that this is the case.”

<head>Chapter XII.—Faustus Appears to His Friends with the Face of Simon.</head>
<p>Now all of us who were with Peter asked each other questions the whole of the night,
and continued awake, because of the pleasure and joy we derived from what was said. But
when at length the dawn began to break, Peter, looking at me and my brothers, said: “I am
puzzled to think what your father has been about.” And just as he was saying this, our
father came in and caught Peter talking to us of him; and seeing him displeased, he accosted
him, and rendered an apology for having slept outside. But we were amazed when we looked
at him: for we saw the form of Simon, but heard the voice of our father Faustus. And when
we were fleeing from him, and abhorring him, our father was astonished at receiving such
harsh and hostile treatment from us. But Peter alone saw his natural shape, and said to us:
“Why do you in horror turn away from your own father?” But we and our mother said:
“It is Simon that we see before us, with the voice of our father.” And Peter said: “You recognise
only his voice, which is unaffected by magic; but as my eyes also are unaffected by
magic, I can see his form as it really is, that he is not Simon, but your father Faustus.” Then,
looking to my father, he said: “It is not your own true form that is seen by them, but that
of Simon, our deadliest foe, and a most impious man.”1521</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Flight of Simon.</head>
<p>While Peter was thus talking, there entered one of those who had gone before to Antioch,
and who, coming back from Antioch, said to Peter: “I wish you to know, my lord, that Simon,
by doing many miracles publicly in Antioch, and calling you a magician and a juggler and
a murderer,1522 has worked them up to such hatred against you, that every man is eager to
taste your very flesh if you should sojourn there.1523 Wherefore we who went before, along
with our brethren who were in pretence attached by you to Simon, seeing the city raging
wildly against you, met secretly and considered what we ought to do. And assuredly, while
we were in great perplexity, Cornelius the centurion arrived, who had been sent by the emperor
to the governor of the province. He was the person whom our Lord cured when he
was possessed of a demon in Cæsarea. This man we sent for secretly; and informing him
of the cause of our despondency, we begged his help. He promised most readily that he
would alarm Simon, and make him take to flight, if we should assist him in his effort. And
when we all promised that we should readily do everything, he said, ‘I shall spread abroad
the news1524 through many friends that I have secretly come to apprehend him; and I shall
pretend that I am in search of him, because the emperor, having put to death many magicians,
and having received information in regard to him, has sent me to search him out, that he
may punish him as he punished the magicians before him; while those of your party who
are with him must report to him, as if they had heard it from a secret source, that I have
been sent to apprehend him. And perchance when he hears it from them, he will be alarmed
and take to flight.’ When, therefore, we had intended to do something else, nevertheless
the affair turned out in the following way. For when he heard the news from many strangers
who gratified him greatly by secretly informing him, and also from our brethren who pretended
to be attached to him, and took it as the opinion of his own followers, he resolved
on retiring. And hastening away from Antioch, he has come here with Athenodorus, as we
have heard. Wherefore we advise you not yet to enter that city, until we ascertain whether
they can forget in his absence the accusations which he brought against you.”</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Change in the Form of Faustus Caused by Simon.</head>
<p>When the person who had gone before gave this report, Peter looked to my father, and
said: “You hear, Faustus; the change in your form has been caused by Simon the magician,
as is now evident. For, thinking that a servant1525of the emperor was seeking him to punish
him, he became afraid and fled, putting you into his own shape, that if you were put to death,
your children might have sorrow.” When my father heard this, he wept and lamented, and
said: “You have conjectured rightly, Peter. For Annubion, who is my dear friend,1526 hinted
his design to me; but I did not believe him, miserable man that I am,1527 since I deserved
to suffer.”</p>

<p>When my father said this, after no long time Annubion came1528 to us to announce to
us the flight of Simon, and how that very night he had hurried to Judæa. And he found our
father wailing, and with lamentations saying: “Alas, alas! unhappy man! I did not believe
when I was told that he was a magician. Miserable man that I am! I have been recognised
for one day by my wife and children, and have speedily gone back to my previous sad condition
when I was still ignorant.” And my mother lamenting, plucked her hair; and we
groaned in distress on account of the transformation of our father, and could not comprehend
what in the world it could be. But Annubion stood speechless, seeing and hearing these
things; while Peter said to us, his children, in the presence of all: “Believe me, this is Faustus
your father. Wherefore I urge you to attend to him as being your father. For God will
vouchsafe some occasion for his putting off the shape of Simon, and exhibiting again distinctly
that of your father.” And saying this, and looking to my father, he said: “I permitted
you to salute Appion and Annubion, since you asserted that they were your friends from
childhood, but I did not permit you to associate with the magician Simon.”</p>

unfortunate man has been the sport of that notorious fellow. But I shall tell you how it took

happened to be listening to Simon, who wished to run away that night, for he had heard
that some people had come to Laodicea in search of him by the command of the emperor.
But as Faustus was entering, he turned1530 his own rage on him, and thus addressed us:
‘Make him, when he comes, share your meals; and I will prepare an ointment, so that, when
he has supped, he may take some of it, and anoint his face with it, and then he will appear
to all to have my shape. But I will anoint you with the juice1531 of some plant, and then you
will not be deceived by his new1532 shape; but to all others Faustus will seem to be Simon.’</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Annubion’s Services to Faustus.</head>
<p>“And while he stated this beforehand, I said, ‘What, then, is the advantage you now expect
to get from such a contrivance?’ And Simon said, ‘First, those who seek me, when they apprehend
him, will give up the search after me. But if he be executed by the hand of the
emperor, very great sorrow will fall upon his children, who left me, and fleeing to Peter, now
aid him in his work.’ And now, Peter, I confess the truth to you: I was prevented by fear
of Simon from informing Faustus of this. But Simon did not give us an opportunity for
private conversation, lest some one of us might reveal1533 to him the wicked design of Simon.
Simon then rose up in the middle of the night and fled to Judæa, convoyed by Appion and
Athenodorus. Then I pretended that I was sick, in order that, remaining after they had
gone, I might make Faustus go back immediately to his own people, if by any chance he
might be able, by being concealed with you, to escape observation, lest, being caught as Simon
by those who were in search of Simon, he might be put to death through the wrath of the
emperor. At the dead of night, therefore, I sent him away to you; and in my anxiety for him
I came by night to see him, with the intention of returning before those who convoyed Simon
should return.” And looking to us, he said: “I, Annubion, see the true shape of your father;
for I was anointed, as I related to you before, by Simon himself, that the true shape of
Faustus might be seen by my eyes. Astonished, therefore, I exceedingly wonder at the magic
power of Simon, in that standing1534 you do not recognise your own father.” And while
our father and our mother and we ourselves wept on account of the calamity common to
all of us, Annubion also through sympathy wept with us.</p>

invests you has been useful to us, and you have assisted us in doing what I shall tell you to
do, then I shall restore to you your true form, when you have first performed my commands.”
And when my father said, “I shall do everything that is in my power most willingly; only
restore to my own people my own form;” Peter answered, “You yourself heard with your
own ears how those who went before me came back from Antioch, and said that Simon had
been there, and had strongly excited the multitudes against me by calling me a magician
and a murderer, a deceiver and a juggler, to such an extent that all the people there were
eager to taste my flesh. You will do, then, as I tell you. You will leave Clement with me,

in regard to Peter are utterly false;1536for he is not a deceiver, nor a murderer, nor a juggler;
nor are any of the evil things true which I, urged on by wrath, said previously in regard to
him. I myself therefore beg of you, I who have been the cause of your hatred to him, cease
from hating him; for he is the true apostle of the true Prophet that was sent by God for the
salvation of the world. Wherefore also I counsel you to believe what he preaches;1537 for if
you do not, your whole city will be utterly destroyed. Now I wish you to know for what
reason I have made this confession to you. This night angels of God scourged me, the impious
one, terribly, as being an enemy to the herald of the truth. I beseech you, therefore,
do not listen to me, even if I myself should come at another time and attempt to say anything

in regard to you as I ought to make.” And Peter again suggested: “When, then, you perceive
the city changing from its hatred of me, and longing to see me, send information to me of
this, and I shall come to you immediately. And when I arrive there, that same day I shall
remove the strange shape which now invests you, and I shall make your own unmistakeably
visible to your own people and to all others.” Saying this, he made his sons, my brothers,
and our mother Mattidia to go along with him; and he also commanded some of his more
intimate acquaintances to accompany him. But my mother was1538 unwilling to go with
him, and said: “I seem to be an adulteress if I associate with the shape of Simon; but if I
shall be compelled to go along with him,1539 it is impossible for me to recline on the same
couch with him! But I do not know if I shall be persuaded to go along with him.” And
while she was very unwilling to go, Annubion urged her, saying: “Believe me and Peter,
and the very voice itself, that this is Faustus your husband, whom I love not less than you.
And I myself will go1540along with him.” When Annubion said this, our mother promised

the evening, when he went to you, he has not been seen by his kinsmen. But yesterday
morning Simon came in search of him; and when we made no reply to him, something
seemed to come over him,1543 for he called himself Faustus; but not being believed, he wept

hearing this, we came, for his own sake, in search of him. But since he is not here, it is plain
that he spake the truth who gave us the information which we, hearing it from him, have
given to you.” And I Clement, perceiving the design of Peter, that he wished to beget a
suspicion in them that he intended to look out among them for the old man, that they might
be afraid and take to flight, assisted in his design, and said to Appion: “Listen to me, my
dearest Appion. We were eager to give to him, as being our father, what we ourselves deemed
to be good. But if he himself did not wish to receive it, but, on the contrary, fled from us in
horror, I shall make a somewhat harsh remark, ‘Nor do we care for him.’” And when I said
this, they went away, as if irritated by my savageness; and, as we learn next day, they went

and in consequence of this, all said that they were eager to see him, and that there were some
who were angry with him as being Simon, on account of their surpassing affection for Peter,
and wished to lay hands on Faustus, believing he was Simon. Wherefore he, fearing that
he might be put to death, had sent to request Peter to come immediately if he wished to
meet him alive, and to appear at the proper time to the city, when it was at the height of its
longing for him.1547 Peter, hearing this, called the multitude together to deliberate, and
appointed one of his attendants bishop; and having remained three days in Laodicea baptizing

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="1220"/>
<head>Introductory Notice
to
Apocrypha of the New Testament.</head>
<p>By Professor M. B. Riddle, D.D.</p>
<p>The translations which follow have been made from the critical edition of Tischendorf
(see Bibliography at close of this volume). The text varies greatly from that of Fabricius. It
was found impossible to introduce the various readings and to cite the manuscript evidence
supporting them. Those who are interested in such study will have recourse to the volumes
of Tischendorf.</p>
<p>The general character of the writings here grouped as “Apocrypha of the New Testament”
will appear from even a cursory perusal of them. It did not require any great discernment
to distinguish between these and the canonical books of the New Testament. The negative
internal evidence thus furnished in support of the authority of the latter need not be emphasized.
But attention may well be called to certain historical facts in regard to these apocryphal
writings:—</p>
<p>1. No one of them ever obtained any general recognition among Christians; still less,
a place in the Canon of the New Testament. A few so-called Gospels are referred to by early
writers; some obtained local recognition; others, written for a purpose, were pressed into
notice by the advocates of the tendency they were written to support: but, as a rule, the
books were soon rejected, and never obtained extensive circulation.</p>
<p>2. Though a few of the Apocryphal Gospels are of comparatively early origin (see
Translator’s Introduction), there is no evidence that any Gospels purporting to be what our
four Gospels are, existed in the first century, or that any other than fragmentary literature
of this character existed even in the second century. The Canon of the New Testament was
not formed out of a mass of writings possessing some claim to recognition, though there is
a popular impression to this effect.</p>
<p>3. Here the character of the writings comes in as confirmatory evidence. Of the Apocryphal
Gospels in general, R. Hofmann1548 well says: “The method employed in these
compositions is always the same, whether the author intended simply to collect and arrange
what was floating in the general tradition, or whether he intended to produce a definite
dogmatical effect. Rarely he threw himself on his own invention; but generally he elaborated
what was only hinted at in the Canonical Gospels, or transcribed words of Jesus into action,
<note type="footnote">1548 Schaff-Herzog, i. p. 105.</note>

<pb n="1221"/>
or described the literal fulfillment of some Jewish expectation concerning the Messiah, or
repeated the wonders of the Old Testament in an inhanced form, etc. The work done, he
took care to conceal his own name, and inscribed his book with the name of some apostle
or disciple, in order to give it authority.” As a rule, therefore, the Apocryphal Gospels give
details regarding those periods of our Lord’s life about which the New Testament is wisely
silent.</p>
<p>The genesis of much of the literature resembles that of modern “Lives of Christ” written
to present a view of the Person of our Lord which is not in accordance with the obvious
sense of the New Testament. Probably some of the Apocryphal Gospels and Acts were not
intended to be forgeries, but only novels with a purpose.1549</p>
<p>4. But while the early Church exercised proper discernment, and the Canon of the New
Testament was soon definitely recognised and universally accepted, the apocryphal writings
were not without influence. The sacred legends, the ecclesiastical traditions, all too potent
in their effect, are in many cases to be traced to these writings. Much that Rome inculcates
is derived from these books, which the Western Church constantly rejected. It is, therefore,
not strange that modern Protestant scholarship has been most active in the investigation of
this literature. The study of these works furnishes not only a defense of the canonical books
of the New Testament, but an effective weapon against that “tradition” which would overbear
the authority of Holy Scripture. No attempt has been made to annotate the various works
in illustration of the above positions, although the temptation to do so was very great. A
few notes have been appended, but it was felt that in most cases the intelligent reader would
not fail to draw the proper conclusions from the documents themselves. Those who desire
to investigate further will find the best helps indicated either in the Introduction of the
translator or in the Bibliography which closes this volume and series.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that no Apocryphal Epistles are included in the literature which follows.
Such forgeries were less common, and the Apocryphal Acts furnished a more convenient
channel for heretical opinions and argument. Of the few in existence, some appear, in
connection with other works, in the Acts of Thaddæus, in the Pseudo-Ignatian Epistles, in
the Clementine Homilies (Epistles of Peter to James), and in Eusebius. The forged letters
of Paul, to the Laodiceans and a third to the Corinthians, deserve little attention, being made
to supply the supposed loss suggested by Col. iv. 16 and I Cor. v. 9. The correspondence of
Paul and Seneca (six letters from the former and eight from the latter) has a certain interest,
but scarcely deserves a place even among the apocryphal writings.</p>
<note type="footnote">1549 In most cases the vocabulary of the books furnishes positive evidence of the late origin. A great number
of terms can be traced to a particular period of ecclesiastical development, while the dogmatic tendencies which
point to a given (and comparatively late) period of controversy are frequent and obvious.</note>

<head>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</head>
<p>Our aim in these translations has been to give a rendering of the original as literal as
possible; and to this we have adhered even in cases—and they are not a few—in which the
Latin or the Greek is not in strict accordance with grammatical rule. It was thought advisable
in all cases to give the reader the means of forming an accurate estimate of the style as well
as the substance of these curious documents.</p>
</div>    

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<head>Part I.—Apocryphal Gospels.</head>
<p>The portion of the volume, extending from page 361 to page 476, comprising the Apocryphal
Gospels properly so called, consists of twenty-two separate documents, of which
ten are written in Greek and twelve in Latin. These twenty-two may be classed under three
heads: (a) those relating to the history of Joseph and of the Virgin Mary, previous to the
birth of Christ; (b) those relating to the infancy of the Saviour; and (c) those relating to the
history of Pilate. The origines of the traditions are the Protevangelium of James, the Gospel
of Thomas, and the Acts of Pilate. All or most of the others can be referred to these three,
as compilations, modifications, or amplifications.</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence of the existence of many of these traditions in the second
century, though it cannot be made out that any of the books were then in existence in their
present form. The greater number of the authorities on the subject, however, seem to agree
in assigning to the first four centuries of the Christian era, the following five books: 1. The
Protevangelium of James; 2. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew; 4. The History of Joseph the
Carpenter; 5. The Gospel of Thomas; 9. The Gospel of Nicodemus.</p>
<p>We proceed to give a very brief notice of each of them.</p>
<p>I. The Protevangelium of James.—The name of Protevangelium was first given to it by
Postel, whose Latin version was published in 1552. The James is usually referred to St. James
the Less, the Lord’s brother; but the titles vary very much.1550 Origen, in the end of the
second century, mentions a book of James, but it is by no means clear that he refers to the
book in question. Justin Martyr, in two passages, refers to the cave in which Christ was
born; and from the end of the fourth century down, there are numerous allusions in ecclesiastical
writings to statements made in the Protevangelium.</p>
<note type="footnote">1550 [James the Lord’s brother, in the earliest Christian literature, is not identified with James the son of Alphæus,
one of the twelve. On the titles, see footnote on first page of text.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1223"/>
<p>For his edition Tischendorf made use of seventeen mss., one of them belonging to the
ninth century. The Greek is good of the kind, and free from errors and corruptions. There
are translations of it into English by Jones (1722) and Cowper (1867).</p>
<p>II. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew.—The majority of the mss. attribute this book to
Matthew, though the titles vary much. The letters prefixed, professing to be written to and
by St. Jerome, exist in several of the mss.; but no one who is acquainted with the style of
Jerome’s letters will think this one authentic. There are, however, in his works many allusions
to some of the legends mentioned in this book. Chapter i.–xxiv. were edited by Thilo,
chapters xxv. to the end are edited for the first time by Tischendorf. It is not very clear
whether the Latin be original, or a direct translation from the Greek. In most part it seems
to be original. The list of epithets, however, applied to the triangles of the Alpha in chapter
xxxi. are pretty obviously mistranslations of Greek technical terms, which it might not be
difficult to reproduce.</p>
<p>III. Gospel of the Nativity of Mary.—This work, which is in substance the same as the
earlier part of the preceding, yet differs from it in several important points, indicating a later
date and a different author. It has acquired great celebrity from having been transferred
almost entire to the Historia Lombardica or Legenda Aurea in the end of the thirteenth
century. Mediæval poetry and sacred art have been very much indebted to its pages.</p>
<p>The original is in Latin, and is not a direct translation from the Greek. In many passages
it follows very closely the Vulgate translation.</p>
<p>IV. The History of Joseph the Carpenter.—The original language of this history is Coptic.
From the Coptic it was translated into Arabic. The Arabic was published by Wallin in 1722,
with a Latin translation and copious notes. Wallin’s version has been republished by Fabricius,
and later in a somewhat amended form by Thilo. This amended form of Wallin’s
version is the text adopted by Tischendorf. Chapters xiv.–xxiii. have been published in the
Sahidic text by Zoega in 1810 with a Latin translation, and more correctly by Dulaurier in
1835 with a French translation.</p>
<p>Tischendorf employs various arguments in support of his opinion that the work belongs
to the fourth century. It is found, he says, in both dialects of the Coptic: the eschatology
of it is not inconsistent with an early date: the feast of the thousand years of chapter xxvi.
had become part of heretical opinion after the third century. The death of the Virgin Mary
in chapter v. is consistent with the doctrine of the assumption, which began to prevail in
the fifth century.</p>
<p>V., VI., VII. The Gospel of Thomas.—Like the Protevangelium of James, the Gospel of
Thomas is of undoubted antiquity. It is mentioned by name by Origen, quoted by Irenæus
and the author of the Philosophumena, who says that it was used by the Nachashenes, a

<pb n="1224"/>
Gnostic sect of the second century. Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386) attributes the authorship
not to the apostle, but to a Thomas who was one of the three disciples of Manes. This fact,
of course, indicates that Cyril knew nothing of the antiquity of the book he was speaking
of. This Manichæan origin has been adopted by many writers, of whom the best known
are in recent times R. Simon and Mingarelli.</p>
<p>The text of the first Greek form is obtained from a Bologna ms. published by Mingarelli
with a Latin translation in 1764, a Dresden ms. of the sixteenth century edited by Thilo, a
Viennese fragment edited by Lambecius, and a Parisian fragment first brought to light by
Coteler in his, edition of the Apostolical Constitutions, and translated into English by Jones.</p>
<p>The second Greek form is published for the first time by Tischendorf, who got the ms.,
which is on paper, of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, from one of the monasteries on
Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>The Latin form is also published for the first time, from a Vatican ms. There is another
Latin text existing in a palimpsest, which Tischendorf assigns to the fifth century, and asserts
to be much nearer the ancient Greek copy than any of the other mss.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear, from the contents of the book, that its author was a Gnostic, a
Docetist, and a Marcosian; and it was held in estimation by the Nachashenes and the
Manichæans. Its bearing upon Christian art, and to some extent Christian dogma, is well
known.</p>
<p>The Greek of the original is by no means good, and the Latin translator has in many
cases mistaken the meaning of common Greek words</p>
<p>VIII. Arabic Gospel of the Saviour’s Infancy.—Chapters i.–ix. are founded on the Gospels
of Luke and Matthew, and on the Protevangelium of James; chapters xxxvi. to the end are
compiled from the Gospel of Thomas; the rest of the book, chapters x. to xxxv., is thoroughly
Oriental in its character, reminding one of the tales of the Arabian Nights, or of the episodes
in the Golden Ass of Apuleius.</p>
<p>It is evident that the work is a compilation, and that the compiler was an Oriental.
Various arguments are adduced to prove that the original language of it was Syriac.</p>
<p>It was first published, with a Latin translation and copious notes, by Professor Sike of
Cambridge in 1697, afterwards by Fabricius, Jones, Schmid, and Thilo. Tischendorf’s text
is Sike’s Latin version amended by Fleischer.</p>
<p>There are not sufficient data for fixing with any accuracy the time at which it was composed
or compiled.</p>

<pb n="1225"/>
<p>IX.–XIV. The Gospel of Nicodemus.1551—The six documents inserted under this name
are various forms of two books—two in Greek and one in Latin of the Acts of Pilate; one in
Greek and two in Latin of the Descent of Christ to the world below. Of twelve mss., only
two or three give the second part consecutively with the first, nor does it so appear in the
Coptic translation. The title of Gospel of Nicodemus does not appear before the thirteenth
century.</p>
<p>Justin Martyr mentions a book called the Acts of Pilate, and Eusebius informs us that
the Emperor Maximim allowed or ordered a book, composed by the pagans under this title,
to be published in a certain portion of the empire, and even to be taught in the schools; but
neither of these could have been the work under consideration.</p>
<p>Tischendorf attributes it to the second century, which is probably too early, though
without doubt the legend was formed by the end of the second century. Maury (Mém. de
la Société des Antiq. de France, t. xx.) places it in the beginning of the fifth century, from
405 to 420; and Renan (Études d’Hist. Relig., p. 177) concurs in this opinion. An able writer
in the Quarterly Review (vol. cxvi.) assigns it to 439; the author of the article Pilate, in Smith’s
Bible Dictionary, gives the end of the third century as the probable date.</p>
<p>The author was probably a Hellenistic Jew converted to Christianity, or, as Tischendorf
and Maury conclude, a Christian imbued with Judaic and Gnostic beliefs. The original
language was most probably Greek, though, as in the case of Pseudo-Matthew, the History
of Joseph the Carpenter, etc., the original language is, in many of the prefaces, stated to have
been Hebrew. Some think that Latin was the original language, on the ground that Pilate
would make his report to the Emperor in that, the official, language. The Latin text we have,
however, is obviously a translation, made, moreover, by a man to whom Greek was not very
familiar, as is obvious from several instances specified in our notes to the text.</p>
<p>The editio princeps of the Latin text is without place or date, and it has been re-edited
by Jones, Birch, Fabricius, Thilo, and others. The Greek text of Part I., and of a portion of
Part II., was first published by Birch, and afterwards in a much improved form, with the
addition of copious notes and prolegomena, by Thilo. The latter part of his prolegomena
contains a full account of the English, French, Italian, and German translations. For his
edition Tischendorf consulted thirty-nine ancient documents, of which a full account is
given in his Prolegomena, pp. lxxi.–lxxvi.</p>
<p>For an interesting account of these documents, see the introduction to Mr. B. H. Cowper’s
translation of the Apocryphal Gospels, pp. lxxxv.–cii.</p>
<note type="footnote">1551 [The numbers here correspond with those of Tischendorf in his prolegomena. In his table of contents,
however, he gives a separate number to the letter of Pilate, which closes XIII. Hence the enumeration differs
from that point.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1226"/>
<p>XV. The Letter of Pontius Pilate.—The text is formed from four authorities, none of
them ancient. A translation of the Greek text of the same letter will be found at p. 480.</p>
<p>XVI., XVII. The Report of Pilate.—The first of these documents was first published by
Fabricius with a Latin translation; the second by Birch, and then by Thilo. Tischendorf has
made use of five mss., the earliest of the twelfth century. It does not seem possible to assign
the date.</p>
<p>XVIII. The Paradosis of Pilate.—It has been well remarked by the author of the article
in the Quarterly Review above referred to, that the early Church looked on Pilate with no
unfavourable eye; that he is favourably shown in the catacombs; that the early Fathers interpreted
him as a figure of the early Church, and held him to be guiltless of Christ’s death;
that the creeds do not condemn him, and the Coptic Church has even made him a saint.
He remarks also that Dante finds punishments for Caiaphas and Annas, but not for Pilate.</p>
<p>The text was first edited by Birch, and afterwards by Thilo. Tischendorf makes use of
five mss., of which the earliest belongs to the twelfth century.</p>
<p>XIX. The Death of Pilate.—This is published for the first time by Tischendorf from a
Latin ms. of the fourteenth century. The language shows it to be of a late date. It appears
almost entire in the Legenda Aurea.</p>
<p>XX. The Narrative of Joseph.—This history seems to have been popular in the middle
ages, if we may judge from the number of the Greek mss. of it which remain.</p>
<p>It was first published by Birch, and after him by Thilo. For his edition Tischendorf
made use of three mss., of which the oldest belongs to the twelfth century.</p>
<p>XXI. The Avenging of the Saviour.—This version of the Legend of Veronica is written
in very barbarous Latin, probably of the seventh or eighth century. An Anglo-Saxon version,
which Tischendorf concludes to be derived from the Latin, was edited and translated for
the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, by C. W. Goodwin, in 1851. The Anglo-Saxon text is
from a ms. in the Cambridge Library, one of a number presented to the Cathedral of Exeter
by Bishop Leofric in the beginning of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>The reader will observe that there are in this document two distinct legends, somewhat
clumsily joined together—that of Nathan’s embassy, and that of Veronica.1552</p>
<note type="footnote">1552 [For a full list of fragments and titles of other Apocryphal Gospels, see Schaff-Herzog, i. p. 106. Twentynine
are given, but in some cases the same work probably appears under two titles.—R.]</note>

<head>Part II.—The Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles.</head>
<p>This portion of the volume, extending from page 477 to page 564, presents us with
documents written in a style considerably different from that of the Apocryphal Gospels
properly so called. There we have without stint the signs that the Jews desired; here we begin
to have some glimpses of the wisdom which the Greeks sought after, along with a considerable
share of
<lg>
<l>Quidquid Græcia mendax</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Audet in historia.</p>
<p>We have less of miracle, more of elaborate discourse. The Apocryphal Gospels were
suited to the vilis plebecula, from which, as Jerome said, the Church originated; the Apocryphal
Acts appeal more to the Academia.</p>
<p>We have in ancient literature, especially Greek literature, a long series of fabulous histories
attached to the names of men who made themselves famous either in arts or arms.
This taste for the marvellous became general after the expedition of Alexander; and from
that time down we have numerous examples of it in the lives of Alexander, of Pythagoras,
of Apollonius of Tyana, of Homer, of Virgil, and others without number; and we all know
how much fabulous matter is apt to gather round the names of popular heroes even in
modern times.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that round the names of Christ and His apostles, who
had brought about social changes greater than those effected by the exploits of any hero of
old, there should gather, as the result of the wondering awe of simple-minded men, a growth
of the romantic and the fabulous.</p>
<p>These stories came at length to form a sort of apostolic cycle, of which the documents
following are portions. They exist also in a Latin form in the ten books of the Acts of the
Apostles, compiled probably in the sixth century, and falsely attributed to Abdias, the first
bishop of Babylon, by whom it was, of course, written in Hebrew.1553</p>
<p>We shall now give a brief account of each of the thirteen documents which make up
this part of the volume.</p>
<p>I. The Acts of Peter and Paul.—This book was first published in a complete form by
Thilo in 1837 and 1838. A portion of it had already been translated into Latin by the famous
Greek scholar Constantine Lascaris in 1490, and had been made use of in the celebrated
controversy as to the situation of the island Melita, upon which St. Paul was shipwrecked.
For his edition Tischendorf collated six mss., the oldest of the end of the ninth century.</p>
<note type="footnote">1553 [That is, this is the tradition. Of such Hebrew original there is no trace.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1228"/>
<p>Some portions at least of the book are of an early date. The Domine quo vadis story, p.
485, is referred to by Origen, and others after him. A book called the Acts of Peter is condemned
in the decree of Pope Gelasius.</p>
<p>II. Acts of Paul and Thecla.—This book is of undoubted antiquity. There seems reason
to accept the account of it given by Tertullian, that it was written by an Asiatic presbyter in
glorification of St. Paul (who, however, unquestionably occupies only a secondary place in
it), and in support of the heretical opinion that women may teach and baptize. It is expressly
mentioned and quoted by a long line of Latin and Greek Fathers. The quotations are inserted
in Tischendorf’s Prolegomena, p. xxiv.</p>
<p>The text was first edited in 1698 by Grabe from a Bodleian ms., republished by Jones
in 1726. A blank in the Bodleian ms. was supplied in 1715 by Thomas Hearne from another
Oxford ms. Tischendorf’s text is from a recension of three Paris mss., each of the eleventh
century.</p>
<p>III. Acts of Barnabas.—This book has more an air of truth about it than any of the
others. There is not much extravagance in the details, and the geography is correct, showing
that the writer knew Cyprus well. It seems to have been written at all events before 478, in
which year the body of Barnabas is said to have been found in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Papebroche first edited the book in the Acta Sanctorum in 1698, with a Latin translation.
The Vatican ms. which he used was an imperfect one. Tischendorf’s text is from a Parisian
ms. of the end of the ninth century.</p>
<p>IV. Acts of Philip.—A book under this name was condemned in the decree of Pope
Gelasius; and that the traditions about Philip were well known from an early date, is evident
from the abundant references to them in ancient documents. The writings of the Hagiographers
also, both Greek and Latin, contain epitomes of Philip’s life.</p>
<p>The Greek text, now first published, is a recension of two mss.,—a Parisian one of the
eleventh century, and a Venetian one. The latter is noticeable, from being superscribed
From the Fifteenth Act to the end, leaving us to infer that we have only a portion of the book.</p>
<p>V. Acts of Philip in Hellas.—This also is published for the first time by Tischendorf. It
is obviously a later document than the preceding, though composed in the same style. It is
from a Parisian ms. of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>VI. Acts of Andrew.—In the decree of Pope Gelasius (d. 496), a book under this name
is condemned as apocryphal. Epiphanius (d. 403) states that the Acts of Andrew were in
favour with the Encratites, the Apostolics, and the Origenians; Augustine (d. 430) mentions
that the Acts of the Apostles written by Leucius Charinus—discipulus diaboli, as Pope
Gelasius calls him—were held in estimation by the Manichæans. The authorship generally

<pb n="1229"/>
is attributed to Leucius by early writers; Innocentius I. (d. 417), however, says that the Acts
of Andrew were composed by the philosophers Nexocharis and Leonidas. This book is
much the same in substance with the celebrated Presbyterorum et Diaconorum Achaiæ de
martyrio S. Andreæ apostoli epistola encyclica, first edited in Greek by Woog in 1749, and
by him considered to be a genuine writing of the apostolic age, composed about a.d. 80.
Thilo, while dissenting from this opinion of Woog’s, concludes that it is a fragment from
the Acts of Leucius, expurgated of most of its heresy, and put into its present shape by an
orthodox writer. Cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine assign the epistle to the apostolic age;
Fabricius thinks it much later.</p>
<p>The probability is that the book was written by Leucius, following earlier traditions, and
that it was afterwards revised and fitted for general reading by an orthodox hand.</p>
<p>Though some of the traditions mentioned in the book are referred to by authors of the
beginning of the fifth century, there does not seem to be any undoubted quotation of it before
the eighth and the tenth centuries. Some portions of Pseudo-Abdias, however, are almost
in the words of our Greek Acts.</p>
<p>The text is edited chiefly from two mss.,—the one of the eleventh, the other of the
fourteenth century.</p>
<p>The Greek of the original is good of the kind, and exhibits considerable rhetorical skill.</p>
<p>VII. Acts of Andrew and Matthias.—Thilo assigns the authorship of these Acts also to
Leucius, and the use of them to the Gnostics, Manichæans, and other heretics. Pseudo-
Abdias seems to have derived his account of Andrew and Matthias from the same source.
Epiphanius the monk, who wrote in the tenth century, gives extracts from the history. There
is, besides, an old English—commonly called Anglo-Saxon—poem, Andrew and Helene,
published by Jacob Grimm in 1840, the argument of which in great part coincides with that
of the Acts of Andrew and Matthias.</p>
<p>There is considerable doubt as to whether it is Matthias or Matthew that is spoken of.
Pseudo-Abdias, followed by all the Latin writers on the subject, calls him Matthew. The
Greek texts hesitate between the two. Tischendorf edits Matthias, on the authority of his
oldest ms. There is also some discrepancy as to the name of the town. Some mss. say Sinope,
others Myrmene or Myrna: they generally, however, coincide in calling it a town of Æthiopia.</p>
<p>Thilo, and Tischendorf after him, made use chiefly of three mss., only one of which, of
the fifteenth century, contains the whole book. The oldest is an uncial ms. of about the
eighth century.</p>
<p>The Acts of Peter and Andrew, from the Bodleian ms., are inserted as an appendix to
the Acts of Andrew and Matthias.</p>

<pb n="1230"/>
<p>VIII. Acts of Matthew.—This book is edited by Tischendorf for the first time. It is a
much later production than the last, written in bad Greek, and in a style rendered very
cumbrous by the use of participial phrases.</p>
<p>On the authority of the oldest ms., Matthew, not Matthias, is the name here. It is
probably owing to this confusion between the names, that there is much uncertainty in the
traditions regarding St. Matthew.</p>
<p>Tischendorf gives, in his Prolegomena, a long extract from Nicephorus, which shows
that he was acquainted with this book, or something very like it.</p>
<p>The text is edited from two mss.,—a Parisian of the eleventh century, and a Viennese
of a later date.</p>
<p>IX. Acts of Thomas.—The substance of this book is of great antiquity, and in its original
form it was held in great estimation by the heretics of the first and second centuries. The
main heresy which it contained was that the Apostle Thomas baptized, not with water, but
with oil only. It is mentioned by Epiphanius, Turribius, and Nicephorus, condemned in
the decree of Gelasius, and in the Synopsis of Scripture ascribed to Athanasius, in which it
is placed, along with the Acts of Peter, Acts of John, and other books, among the Antilegomena.
St. Augustine in three passages refers to the book in such a way as to show that he had
it in something very like its present form. Two centuries later, Pseudo-Abdias made a recension
of the book, rejecting the more heretical portions, and adapting it generally to orthodox
use. Photius attributes the authorship of this document, as of many other apocryphal
Acts, to Leucius Charinus.</p>
<p>The Greek text was first edited, with copious notes and prolegomena, by Thilo in 1823.
The text from which the present translation is made is a recension of five mss., the oldest
of the tenth century.</p>
<p>X. Consummation of Thomas.—This is properly a portion of the preceding book.
Pseudo-Abdias follows it very closely, but the Greek of some chapters of his translation or
compilation has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>The text, edited by Tischendorf for the first time, is from a ms. of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>XI. Martyrdom of Bartholomew.—This Greek text, now for the first time edited by
Tischendorf, is very similar to the account of Bartholomew in Pseudo-Abdias. The editor
is inclined to believe, not that the Greek text is a translation of Abdias, which it probably is,
but that both it and Abdias are derived from the same source. Tischendorf seems inclined
to lay some weight upon the mention made by Abdias of a certain Crato, said to be a disciple
of the Apostles Simon and Judas, having written a voluminous history of the apostles, which
was translated into Latin by Julius Africanus. The whole story, however, is absurd. It is
very improbable that Julius Africanus knew any Latin; it is possible, however, that he may

<pb n="1231"/>
have compiled some stories of the apostles, that these may have been translated into Latin,
and that Pseudo-Crato and Pseudo-Abdias may have derived some of their materials from
this source.</p>
<p>The Greek text is edited from a Venetian ms. of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>XII. Acts of Thaddæus.—This document, of which our text is the editio princeps, is of
some consequence, as giving in another form the famous letters of Christ to Abgarus. Eusebius
(H. E., i. 13) says that he found in the archives of Edessa the letters written by their
own hands, and that he translated them from the Syriac. The story of the portrait was a
later invention. It is found in Pseudo-Abdias (x. 1), and with great detail in Nicephorus (H.
E., ii. 7). There is considerable variety in the texts of the letters. They were probably written
in Syriac in the third century by some native of Edessa, who wished to add to the importance
of his city and the antiquity of his church. See the whole subject discussed in Dr. Cureton’s
Ancient Syriac Documents relative to the earliest establishment of Christianity in Edessa.</p>
<p>The Greek text, which is probably of the sixth or seventh century, seems, from allusions
to the synagogue, the hours of prayer, the Sabbath-day, etc., to have been written by a Jew.
It is edited from a Paris ms. of the eleventh century, and a Vienna one of a later date.</p>
<p>XIII. Acts of John.—A book under this title is mentioned by Eusebius, Epiphanius,
Photius, among Greek writers; Augustine, Philastrius, Innocent I., and Turribius among
Latin writers. The two last named and Photius ascribe the authorship to Leucius, discipulus
diaboli, who got the credit of all these heretical brochures. It is not named in the decree of
Gelasius.</p>
<p>Augustine (Tractat. 124 in Johannem) relates at length the story of John going down
alive into his grave, and of the fact of his being alive being shown by his breath stirring about
the dust on the tomb. This story, which has some resemblance to the Teutonic legend of
Barbarossa, is repeated by Photius.</p>
<p>There is a Latin document published by Fabricius, Pseudo-Melitonis liber de Passione
S. Johannis Evangelistæ, which the author professed to write with the original of Leucius
before his eyes. It has considerable resemblances in some passages to the present text. The
only passages in Pseudo-Abdias that appear to have any connection with the present document
are those which refer to the apostle’s burial.</p>
<p>The text is edited from a Paris ms. of the eleventh century, and a Vienna one, to which
no date is assigned.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the narrative part of the Acts of John be by the same hand as the

<head>Part III.—Apocryphal Apocalypses.</head>
<p>This portion of the volume, extending from page 565 to page 598, consists of seven
documents, four of which are called Apocalypses by their authors. Of these, the Greek text
of the first three is edited for the first time; the fourth, the Apocalypse of John, has appeared
before. The fifth, The Falling Asleep of Mary, appears for the first time in its Greek form,
and in the first Latin recension of it.</p>
<p>The mss. of these documents are characterized by extreme variety of readings; and in
some of them, especially the earlier portion of the Apocalypse of Esdras, the text is in a very
corrupt state.</p>
<p>I. The Apocalypse of Moses.—This document belongs to the Apocrypha of the Old
Testament rather than that of the New. We have been unable to find in it any reference to
any Christian writing. In its form, too, it appears to be a portion of some larger work. Parts
of it at least are of an ancient date, as it is very likely from this source that the writer of the
Gospel of Nicodemus took the celebrated legend of the Tree of Life and the Oil of Mercy.
An account of this legend will be found in Cowper’s Apocryphal Gospels, xcix.–cii.; in Maury,
Croyances et Légendes de l’Antiquité, p. 294; in Renan’s commentary to the Syriac text of
the Penitence of Adam, edited and translated by Renan in the Journal Asiatique for 1853.
There appeared a poetical rendering of the legend in Blackwood’s Magazine ten or twelve
years ago.</p>
<p>Tischendorf’s text is made from four mss.: A, a Venice ms. of the thirteenth century;
B and C, Vienna mss. of the thirteenth and twelfth centuries respectively; and D, a Milan
ms. of about the eleventh century.</p>
<p>II. The Apocalypse of Esdras.—This book is a weak imitation of the apocryphal fourth
book of Esdras. Thilo, in his prolegomena to the Acts of Thomas, p. lxxxii., mentions it,
and doubts whether it be the fourth book of Esdras or not. Portions of it were published
by Dr. Hase of the Paris Library, and it was then seen that it was a different production.
The ms. is of about the fifteenth century, and in the earlier portions very difficult to read.</p>
<p>III. The Apocalypse of Paul.—There are two apocryphal books bearing the name of Paul
mentioned by ancient writers: The Ascension of Paul, adopted by the Cainites and the
Gnostics; and the Apocalypse of Paul, spoken of by Augustine and Sozomen. There seems
to be no doubt that the present text, discovered by Tischendorf in 1843, and published by
him in 1866, is the book mentioned by Augustine and Sozomen. It is referred to by numerous
authorities, one of whom, however, ascribes it to the heretic Paul of Samosata, the founder
of the sect of the Paulicians.</p>
<p>There appear to be versions of it in Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic. One of the Syriac versions,
from an Urumiyeh ms., was translated into English by an American missionary in 1864.

<pb n="1233"/>
This translation, or the greater portion of it, is printed by Tischendorf along with his edition
of the text.</p>
<p>Tischendorf, upon what seems to be pretty good evidence, ascribes it to the year 380.
It is from a Milan ms. of not earlier than the fifteenth century. There is another ms. two
centuries older; but they both seem to be copied from the same original. The Syriac seems
to be later than the Greek, and, according to Eastern fashion, fuller in details.</p>
<p>IV. The Apocalypse of John.—In the scholia to the Grammar of Dionysius the Thracian,
ascribed to the ninth century, immediately after the ascription of the Apocalypse of Paul to
Paul of Samosata, there occurs the following statement: ‘And there is another called the
Apocalypse of John the Theologian. We do not speak of that in the island of Patmos, God
forbid, for it is most true; but of a supposititious and spurious one.’ This is the oldest reference
to this Apocalypse. Asseman says he found the book in Arabic in three mss.</p>
<p>The document was first edited by Birch in 1804, from a Vatican ms., collated with a
Vienna ms. For his edition Tischendorf collated other five mss., two of Paris, three of Vienna,
of from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Of other Apocalypses, Tischendorf in his Prolegomena gives an abstract of the Apocalypse
of Peter, the Apocalypse of Bartholomew, the Apocalypse of Mary, and the Apocalypse of
Daniel. The Apocalypse of Peter professes to be written by Clement. There is an Arabic
ms. of it in the Bodleian Library. It is called the Perfect Book, or the Book of Perfection,
and consists of eighty-nine chapters, comprising a history of the world as revealed to Peter,
from the foundation of the world to the appearing of Antichrist.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Bartholomew, from a ms. in the Paris Library, was edited and
translated by Dulaurier in 1835. The translation appears in Tischendorf’s Prolegomena.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Mary, containing her descent to the lower world, appears in several
Greek mss. It is of a late date, the work of some monk of the middle ages.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Daniel, otherwise called the Revelation of the Prophet Daniel about
the consummation of the world, is also of a late date. About the half of the Greek text is
given in the Prolegomena. We have not thought it necessary to translate it.</p>
<p>V., VI., VII. The Assumption of Mary.—It is somewhat strange that the Greek text of
this book, which has been translated into several languages both of the East and the West,
is edited by Tischendorf for the first time. He assigns it to a date not later than the fourth
century. A book under this title is condemned in the decree of Gelasius. The author of the
Second Latin Form (see p. 595, note), writing under the name of Melito, ascribes the authorship
of a treatise on the same subject to Leucius. This, however, cannot be the book so
ascribed to Leucius, as Pseudo-Melito affirms that his book, which is in substance the same
as the Greek text, was written to condemn Leucius’ heresies.</p>

<pb n="1234"/>
<p>There are translations or recensions of our text in Syriac, Sahidic, and Arabic. The
Syriac was edited and translated by Wright in 1865, in his Contributions to the Apocryphal
Literature of the New Testament. Another recension of it was published in the Journal of
Sacred Literature for January and April, 1864. An Arabic version of it, resembling more the
Syriac than the Greek or Latin, was edited and translated by Enger in 1854. The Sahidic
recension, published and translated by Zoega and Dulaurier, is considerably different from
our present texts. The numerous Latin recensions also differ considerably from each other,
as will be seen from a comparison of the First Latin Form with the Second. They are all,
however, from the same source, and that probably the Greek text which we have translated.
The Greek texts, again, exhibit considerable variations, especially in the latter portions.</p>
<p>In the end of the seventh century, John Archbishop of Thessalonica wrote a discourse
on the falling asleep of Mary, mainly derived from the book of Pseudo-John; and in some
mss. this treatise of John of Thessalonica is ascribed to John the Apostle. Epiphanius,
however, makes distinctive mention of both treatises.</p>
<p>For his edition of the Greek text, Tischendorf made use of five mss., the oldest of the
eleventh century.</p>
<p>The First Latin Form is edited from three Italian mss., the oldest of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The Second Latin Form, which has been previously published elsewhere, is from a
Venetian ms. of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>We have now concluded our notices, compiled chiefly from Tischendorf’s Prolegomena,
of the Apocryphal Literature of the New Testament.</p>
<p>While these documents are of considerable interest and value, as giving evidence of a
widespread feeling in early times of the importance of the events which form the basis of
our belief, and as affording us curious glimpses of the state of the Christian conscience, and
of modes of Christian thought, in the first centuries of our era, the predominant impression
which they leave on our minds is a profound sense of the immeasurable superiority, the
unapproachable simplicity and majesty, of the Canonical Writings.</p>

<p>1. In the records of the twelve tribes of Israel was Joachim, a man rich exceedingly; and
he brought his offerings double,1555 saying: There shall be of my superabundance to all the
people, and there shall be the offering for my forgiveness1556 to the Lord for a propitiation
for me.1557 For the great day of the Lord was at hand, and the sons of Israel were bringing
their offerings. And there stood over against him Rubim, saying: It is not meet for thee
first to bring thine offerings, because thou hast not made seed in Israel.1558 And Joachim
was exceedingly grieved, and went away to the registers of the twelve tribes of the people,
saying: I shall see the registers of the twelve tribes of Israel, as to whether I alone have not
made seed in Israel. And he searched, and found that all the righteous had raised up seed
in Israel. And he called to mind the patriarch Abraham, that in the last day1559 God gave
him a son Isaac. And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and did not come into the presence
of his wife; but he retired to the desert,1560 and there pitched his tent, and fasted forty days
and forty nights,1561 saying in himself: I will not go down either for food or for drink until
the Lord my God shall look upon me, and prayer shall be my food and drink.</p>
<note type="footnote">1554 [This title is taken by Tischendorf from a manuscript of the eleventh century (Paris). At least seventeen
other forms exist. The book is variously named by ancient writers. In the decree of Gelasius (a.d. 495) he condemns
it as Evangelium nomine Jacobi minoris apocryphum. The text of Tischendorf, here translated, is somewhat
less diffuse than that of Fabricius, and is based on manuscript evidence. The variations are verbal and formal
rather than material.—R.]</note>

<p>2. And his wife Anna1562 mourned in two mournings, and lamented in two lamentations,
saying: I shall bewail my widowhood; I shall bewail my childlessness. And the great day of
the Lord was at hand; and Judith1563 her maid-servant said: How long dost thou humiliate
thy soul? Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand, and it is unlawful for thee to mourn.
But take this head-band, which the woman that made it gave to me; for it is not proper that
I should wear it, because I am a maid-servant, and it has a royal appearance.1564 And Anna
said: Depart from me; for I have not done such things, and the Lord has brought me very
low. I fear that some wicked person has given it to thee, and thou hast come to make me a
sharer in thy sin. And Judith said: Why should I curse thee, seeing that1565 the Lord hath
shut thy womb, so as not to give thee fruit in Israel? And Anna was grieved exceedingly,
and put off her garments of mourning, and cleaned her head, and put on her wedding garments,
and about the ninth hour went down to the garden to walk. And she saw a laurel,
and sat under it, and prayed to the Lord, saying: O God of our fathers, bless me and hear
my prayer, as Thou didst bless the womb of Sarah, and didst give her a son Isaac.1566</p>
 <p>3. And gazing towards the heaven, she saw a sparrow’s nest in the laurel,1567 and made
a lamentation in herself, saying: Alas! who begot me? and what womb produced me? because
I have become a curse in the presence of the sons of Israel, and I have been reproached, and
they have driven me in derision out of the temple of the Lord. Alas! to what have I been
likened? I am not like the fowls of the heaven, because even the fowls of the heaven are
productive before Thee, O Lord. Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like the beasts
of the earth, because even the beasts of the earth are productive before Thee, O Lord. Alas!
to what have I been likened? I am not like these waters, because even these waters are productive
before Thee, O Lord. Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like this earth,
because even the earth bringeth forth its fruits in season, and blesseth Thee, O Lord.1568</p>
 <p>4. And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by, saying: Anna, Anna, the Lord hath heard
thy prayer, and thou shalt conceive, and shall bring forth; and thy seed shall be spoken of
in all the world. And Anna said: As the Lord my God liveth, if I beget either male or female,
I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my God; and it shall minister to Him in holy things all
the days of its life.1569 And, behold, two angels came, saying to her: Behold, Joachim thy

husband is coming with his flocks.1570 For an angel of the Lord went down to him, saying:
Joachim, Joachim, the Lord God hath heard thy prayer. Go down hence; for, behold, thy
wife Anna shall conceive. And Joachim went down and called his shepherds, saying: Bring
me hither ten she-lambs without spot or blemish, and they shall be for the Lord my God;
and bring me twelve tender calves, and they shall be for the priests and the elders; and a
hundred goats for all the people. And, behold, Joachim came with his flocks; and Anna
stood by the gate, and saw Joachim coming, and she ran and hung upon his neck, saying:
Now I know that the Lord God hath blessed me exceedingly; for, behold the widow no longer
a widow, and I the childless shall conceive. And Joachim rested the first day in his house.</p>
<p>5. And on the following day he brought his offerings, saying in himself: If the Lord
God has been rendered gracious to me, the plate1571 on the priest’s forehead will make it
manifest to me. And Joachim brought his offerings, and observed attentively the priest’s
plate when he went up to the altar of the Lord, and he saw no sin in himself. And Joachim
said: Now I know that the Lord has been gracious unto me, and has remitted all my sins.
And he went down from the temple of the Lord justified, and departed to his own house.
And her months were fulfilled, and in the ninth1572 month Anna brought forth. And she
said to the midwife: What have I brought forth? and she said: A girl. And said Anna: My
soul has been magnified this day. And she laid her down. And the days having been fulfilled,
Anna was purified, and gave the breast to the child,1573 and called her name Mary.</p>
<p>6. And the child grew strong day by day; and when she was six1574 months old, her
mother set her on the ground to try whether she could stand, and she walked seven steps
and came into her bosom; and she snatched her up, saying: As the Lord my God liveth,
thou shalt not walk on this earth until I bring thee into the temple of the Lord. And she
made a sanctuary in her bed-chamber, and allowed nothing common or unclean to pass
through her. And she called the undefiled daughters of the Hebrews, and they led her
astray.1575 And when she was a year old, Joachim made a great feast, and invited the priests,
and the scribes, and the elders, and all the people of Israel. And Joachim brought the child
to the priests; and they blessed her, saying: O God of our fathers, bless this child, and give
her an everlasting name to be named in all generations. And all the people said: So be it,

so be it, amen. And he brought her to the chief priests; and they blessed her, saying: O God
most high, look upon this child, and bless her with the utmost blessing, which shall be for
ever. And her mother snatched her up, and took her into the sanctuary of her bed-chamber,
and gave her the breast. And Anna made a song to the Lord God, saying: I will sing a song
to the Lord my God, for He hath looked upon me, and hath taken away the reproach of
mine enemies; and the Lord hath given the fruit of His righteousness, singular in its kind,
and richly endowed before Him. Who will tell the sons of Rubim that Anna gives suck?
Hear, hear, ye twelve tribes of Israel, that Anna gives suck. And she laid her to rest in the
bed-chamber of her sanctuary, and went out and ministered unto them. And when the
supper was ended, they went down rejoicing, and glorifying the God of Israel.1576</p>
<p>7. And her months were added to the child. And the child was two years old, and
Joachim said: Let us take her up to the temple of the Lord, that we may pay the vow that
we have vowed, lest perchance the Lord send to us,1577 and our offering be not received.
And Anna said: Let us wait for the third year, in order that the child may not seek for
father or mother. And Joachim said: So let us wait. And the child was three years old, and
Joachim said: Invite the daughters of the Hebrews that are undefiled, and let them take each
a lamp, and let them stand with the lamps burning, that the child may not turn back, and
her heart be captivated from the temple of the Lord. And they did so until they went up
into the temple of the Lord. And the priest received her, and kissed her, and blessed her,
saying: The Lord has magnified thy name in all generations. In thee, on the last of the days,
the Lord will manifest His redemption to the sons of Israel. And he set her down upon the
third step of the altar, and the Lord God sent grace upon her; and she danced with her feet,
and all the house of Israel loved her.</p>
 <p>8. And her parents went down marvelling, and praising the Lord God, because the child
had not turned back. And Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that
dwelt there, and she received food from the hand of an angel. And when she was twelve1578
years old there was held a council of the priests, saying: Behold, Mary has reached the age
of twelve years in the temple of the Lord. What then shall we do with her, lest perchance
she defile the sanctuary of the Lord? And they said to the high priest: Thou standest by the
altar of the Lord; go in, and pray concerning her; and whatever the Lord shall manifest unto
thee, that also will we do. And the high priest went in, taking the robe1579 with the twelve
<note type="footnote">1576 Two of themss. add: And they gave her the name of Mary, because her name shall not fade forever.

bells into the holy of holies; and he prayed concerning her. And behold an angel of the Lord
stood by him, saying unto him: Zacharias, Zacharias, go out and assemble the widowers of
the people, and let them bring each his rod; and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign,
his wife shall she be. And the heralds went out through all the circuit of Judæa, and the
trumpet of the Lord sounded, and all ran.</p>
<p>9. And Joseph, throwing away his axe, went out to meet them; and when they had assembled,
they went away to the high priest, taking with them their rods. And he, taking the
rods of all of them, entered into the temple, and prayed; and having ended his prayer, he
took the rods and came out, and gave them to them: but there was no sign in them, and
Joseph took his rod last; and, behold, a dove came out of the rod, and flew upon Joseph’s
head. And the priest said to Joseph, Thou hast been chosen by lot to take into thy keeping
the virgin of the Lord. But Joseph refused, saying: I have children, and I am an old man,
and she is a young girl. I am afraid lest I become a laughing-stock to the sons of Israel. And
the priest said to Joseph: Fear the Lord thy God, and remember what the Lord did to
Dathan, and Abiram, and Korah;1580 how the earth opened, and they were swallowed up
on account of their contradiction. And now fear, O Joseph, lest the same things happen in
thy house. And Joseph was afraid, and took her into his keeping. And Joseph said to Mary:
Behold, I have received thee from the temple of the Lord; and now I leave thee in my house,
and go away to build my buildings, and I shall come to thee. The Lord will protect thee.</p>
<p>10. And there was a council of the priests, saying: Let us make a veil for the temple of
the Lord. And the priest said: Call to me the undefiled virgins of the family of David. And
the officers went away, and sought, and found seven virgins. And the priest remembered
the child Mary, that she was of the family of David, and undefiled before God. And the officers
went away and brought her. And they brought them into the temple of the Lord.
And the priest said: Choose for me by lot who shall spin the gold, and the white,1581 and
the fine linen, and the silk, and the blue,1582 and the scarlet, and the true purple.1583 And
the true purple and the scarlet fell to the lot of Mary, and she took them, and went away to
her house. And at that time Zacharias was dumb, and Samuel was in his place until the time
that Zacharias spake. And Mary took the scarlet, and span it.</p>
<p>11. And she took the pitcher, and went out to fill it with water. And, behold, a voice
saying: Hail, thou who hast received grace; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among
women!1584 And she looked round, on the right hand and on the left, to see whence this

voice came. And she went away, trembling, to her house, and put down the pitcher; and
taking the purple, she sat down on her seat, and drew it out. And, behold, an angel of the
Lord stood before her, saying: Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found grace before the Lord
of all, and thou shalt conceive, according to His word. And she hearing, reasoned with
herself, saying: Shall I conceive by the Lord, the living God? and shall I bring forth as every
woman brings forth? And the angel of the Lord said: Not so, Mary; for the power of the
Lord shall overshadow thee: wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall
be called the Son of the Most High. And thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save
His people from their sins. And Mary said: Behold, the servant of the Lord before His face:
let it be unto me according to thy word.</p>
<p>12. And she made the purple and the scarlet, and took them to the priest. And the
priest blessed her, and said: Mary, the Lord God hath magnified thy name, and thou shalt
be blessed in all the generations of the earth. And Mary, with great joy, went away to
Elizabeth her kinswoman,1585 and knocked at the door. And when Elizabeth heard her,
she threw away the scarlet,1586 and ran to the door, and opened it; and seeing Mary, she
blessed her, and said: Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to
me? for, behold, that which is in me leaped and blessed thee.1587 But Mary had forgotten
the mysteries of which the archangel Gabriel had spoken, and gazed up into heaven, and
said: Who am I, O Lord, that all the generations of the earth should bless me?1588 And she
remained three months with Elizabeth; and day by day she grew bigger. And Mary being
afraid, went away to her own house, and hid herself from the sons of Israel. And she was
sixteen1589 years old when these mysteries happened.</p>   
<p>13. And she was in her sixth month; and, behold, Joseph came back from his building,
and, entering into his house, he discovered that she was big with child. And he smote1590
his face,1591 and threw himself on the ground upon the sackcloth, and wept bitterly, saying:
With what face shall I look upon the Lord my God? and what prayer shall I make about this
maiden? because I received her a virgin out of the temple of the Lord, and I have not watched
over her. Who is it that has hunted me1592 down? Who has done this evil thing in my
house, and defiled the virgin? Has not the history of Adam been repeated in me? For just

as Adam was in the hour of his singing praise,1593 and the serpent came, and found Eve
alone, and completely deceived her, so it has happened to me also. And Joseph stood up
from the sackcloth, and called Mary, and said to her: O thou who hast been cared for by
God, why hast thou done this and forgotten the Lord thy God? Why hast thou brought low
thy soul, thou that wast brought up in the holy of holies, and that didst receive food from
the hand of an angel? And she wept bitterly, saying: I am innocent, and have known no
man. And Joseph said to her: Whence then is that which is in thy womb? And she said:
As the Lord my God liveth, I do not know whence it is to me.</p>
<p>14. And Joseph was greatly afraid, and retired from her, and considered what he should
do in regard to her.1594 And Joseph said: If I conceal her sin, I find myself fighting against

her be from an angel,1595 and I shall be found giving up innocent blood to the doom of
death. What then shall I do with her? I will put her away from me secretly. And night came
upon him; and, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream, saying: Be not
afraid for this maiden, for that which is in her is of the Holy Spirit; and she will bring forth
a Son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.1596
And Joseph arose from sleep, and glorified the God of Israel, who had given him this grace;
and he kept her.</p>
<p>15. And Annas the scribe came to him, and said: Why hast thou not appeared in our
assembly? And Joseph said to him: Because I was weary from my journey, and rested the
first day. And he turned, and saw that Mary was with child. And he ran away to the
priest,1597 and said to him: Joseph, whom thou didst vouch for, has committed a grievous
crime. And the priest said: How so? And he said: He has defiled the virgin whom he received
out of the temple of the Lord, and has married her by stealth, and has not revealed
it to the sons of Israel. And the priest answering, said: Has Joseph done this? Then said
Annas the scribe: Send officers, and thou wilt find the virgin with child. And the officers
went away, and found it as he had said; and they brought her along with Joseph to the
tribunal. And the priest said: Mary, why hast thou done this? and why hast thou brought
thy soul low, and forgotten the Lord thy God? Thou that wast reared in the holy of holies,
and that didst receive food from the hand of an angel, and didst hear the hymns, and didst

God liveth, I am pure before Him, and know not a man. And the priest said to Joseph:
Why hast thou done this? And Joseph said: As the Lord liveth, I am pure concerning her.
Then said the priest: Bear not false witness, but speak the truth. Thou hast married her by
stealth, and hast not revealed it to the sons of Israel, and hast not bowed thy head under the
strong hand, that thy seed might be blessed. And Joseph was silent.</p>
<p>16. And the priest said: Give up the virgin whom thou didst receive out of the temple
of the Lord. And Joseph burst into tears. And the priest said: I will give you to drink of
the water of the ordeal of the Lord,1598 and He shall make manifest your sins in your eyes.
And the priest took the water, and gave Joseph to drink and sent him away to the hillcountry;
and he returned unhurt. And he gave to Mary also to drink, and sent her away to
the hill-country; and she returned unhurt. And all the people wondered that sin did not
appear in them. And the priest said: If the Lord God has not made manifest your sins,
neither do I judge you. And he sent them away. And Joseph took Mary, and went away to
his own house, rejoicing and glorifying the God of Israel.</p>
<p>17. And there was an order from the Emperor Augustus, that all in Bethlehem of Judæa
should be enrolled.1599 And Joseph said: I shall enrol my sons, but what shall I do with
this maiden? How shall I enrol her? As my wife? I am ashamed. As my daughter then?
But all the sons of Israel know that she is not my daughter. The day of the Lord shall itself
bring it to pass1600 as the Lord will. And he saddled the ass, and set her upon it; and his
son led it, and Joseph followed.1601 And when they had come within three miles, Joseph
turned and saw her sorrowful; and he said to himself: Likely that which is in her distresses
her. And again Joseph turned and saw her laughing. And he said to her: Mary, how is it
that I see in thy face at one time laughter, at another sorrow? And Mary said to Joseph:
Because I see two peoples with my eyes; the one weeping and lamenting, and the other rejoicing
and exulting. And they came into the middle of the road, and Mary said to him:
Take me down from off the ass, for that which is in me presses to come forth. And he took
her down from off the ass, and said to her: Whither shall I lead thee, and cover thy disgrace?
for the place is desert.</p>
<p>18. And he found a cave1602 there, and led her into it; and leaving his two sons beside
her, he went out to seek a widwife in the district of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>And I Joseph was walking, and was not walking; and I looked up into the sky, and saw
the sky astonished; and I looked up to the pole of the heavens, and saw it standing, and the
birds of the air keeping still. And I looked down upon the earth, and saw a trough lying,
and work-people reclining: and their hands were in the trough. And those that were eating
did not eat, and those that were rising did not carry it up, and those that were conveying
anything to their mouths did not convey it; but the faces of all were looking upwards. And
I saw the sheep walking, and the sheep stood still; and the shepherd raised his hand to strike
them, and his hand remained up. And I looked upon the current of the river, and I saw the
mouths of the kids resting on the water and not drinking, and all things in a moment were
driven from their course.</p>
<p>19. And I saw a woman coming down from the hill-country, and she said to me: O
man, whither art thou going? And I said: I am seeking an Hebrew midwife. And she
answered and said unto me: Art thou of Israel? And I said to her: Yes. And she said: And
who is it that is bringing forth in the cave? And I said: A woman betrothed to me. And
she said to me: Is she not thy wife? And I said to her: It is Mary that was reared in the
temple of the Lord, and I obtained her by lot as my wife. And yet she is not my wife, but
has conceived of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And the widwife said to him: Is this true? And Joseph said to her: Come and see. And
the midwife went away with him. And they stood in the place of the cave, and behold a luminous
cloud overshadowed the cave. And the midwife said: My soul has been magnified
this day, because mine eyes have seen strange things—because salvation has been brought
forth to Israel. And immediately the cloud disappeared out of the cave, and a great light
shone in the cave, so that the eyes could not bear it. And in a little that light gradually decreased,
until the infant appeared, and went and took the breast from His mother Mary.
And the midwife cried out, and said: This is a great day to me, because I have seen this
strange sight. And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. And she
said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to thee: a virgin has brought
forth—a thing which her nature admits not of. Then said Salome: As the Lord my God
liveth, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the parts, I will not believe that a virgin has
brought forth.</p>
<p>20. And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show thyself; for no small controversy
has arisen about thee. And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me
for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold,
my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire. And she bent her knees before the Lord,

saying: O God of my fathers, remember that I am the seed of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob; do not make a show of me to the sons of Israel, but restore me to the poor; for Thou
knowest, O Lord, that in Thy name I have performed my services, and that I have received
my reward at Thy hand. And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by her, saying to her: Salome,
Salome, the Lord hath heard thee. Put thy hand to the infant, and carry it, and thou
wilt have safety and joy. And Salome went and carried it, saying: I will worship Him, because
a great King has been born to Israel. And, behold, Salome was immediately cured, and she
went forth out of the cave justified. And behold a voice saying: Salome, Salome, tell not
the strange things thou hast seen, until the child has come into Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21. And, behold, Joseph was ready to go into Judæa. And there was a great commotion
in Bethlehem of Judæa, for Magi came, saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews?
for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him. And when Herod
heard, he was much disturbed, and sent officers to the Magi. And he sent for the priests,
and examined them, saying: How is it written about the Christ? where is He to be born?
And they said: In Bethlehem of Judæa, for so it is written.1603 And he sent them away.
And he examined the Magi, saying to them: What sign have you seen in reference to the
king that has been born? And the Magi said: We have seen a star of great size shining
among these stars, and obscuring their light, so that the stars did not appear; and we thus
knew that a king has been born to Israel, and we have come to worship him. And Herod
said: Go and seek him; and if you find him, let me know, in order that I also may go and
worship him. And the Magi went out. And, behold, the star which they had seen in the
east went before them until they came to the cave, and it stood over the top of the cave.
And the Magi saw the infant with His mother Mary; and they brought forth from their bag
gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned by the angel not to go into
Judæa, they went into their own country by another road.1604</p>
<p>22. And when Herod knew that he had been mocked by the Magi, in a rage he sent
murderers, saying to them: Slay the children1605 from two years old and under. And Mary,
having heard that the children were being killed, was afraid, and took the infant and swaddled
Him, and put Him into an ox-stall. And Elizabeth, having heard that they were searching
for John, took him and went up into the hill-country, and kept looking where to conceal
him. And there was no place of concealment. And Elizabeth, groaning with a loud voice,
says: O mountain of God, receive mother and child. And immediately the mountain was
cleft, and received her. And a light shone about them, for an angel of the Lord was with
them, watching over them.</p>

thou hid thy son? And he, answering, said to them: I am the servant of God in holy things,
and I sit constantly in the temple of the Lord: I do not know where my son is. And the officers
went away, and reported all these things to Herod. And Herod was enraged, and said:
His son is destined to be king over Israel. And he sent to him again, saying: Tell the truth;
where is thy son? for thou knowest that thy life is in my hand. And Zacharias said: I am
God’s martyr, if thou sheddest my blood; for the Lord will receive my spirit, because thou
sheddest innocent blood at the vestibule of the temple of the Lord. And Zacharias was
murdered about daybreak. And the sons of Israel did not know that he had been
murdered.1606</p>
<p>24. But at the hour of the salutation the priests went away, and Zacharias did not come
forth to meet them with a blessing, according to his custom.1607 And the priests stood
waiting for Zacharias to salute him at the prayer,1608 and to glorify the Most High. And he
still delaying, they were all afraid. But one of them ventured to go in, and he saw clotted
blood beside the altar; and he heard a voice saying: Zacharias has been murdered, and his
blood shall not be wiped up until his avenger come. And hearing this saying, he was afraid,
and went out and told it to the priests. And they ventured in, and saw what had happened;
and the fretwork of the temple made a wailing noise, and they rent their clothes1609 from
the top even to the bottom. And they found not his body, but they found his blood turned
into stone. And they were afraid, and went out and reported to the people that Zacharias
had been murdered. And all the tribes of the people heard, and mourned, and lamented
for him three days and three nights. And after the three days, the priests consulted as to
whom they should put in his place; and the lot fell upon Simeon. For it was he who had
been warned by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he should see the Christ
in the flesh.1610</p>

<head>The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew.</head>
<p>Here beginneth the book of the Birth of the Blessed Mary and the Infancy of the Saviour.
Written in Hebrew by the Blessed Evangelist Matthew, and translated into Latin by the
Blessed Presbyter Jerome.</p>
<p>To their well-beloved brother Jerome the Presbyter, Bishops Cromatius and Heliodorus
in the Lord, greeting.</p>
<p>The birth of the Virgin Mary, and the nativity and infancy of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
find in apocryphal books. But considering that in them many things contrary to our faith
are written, we have believed that they ought all to be rejected, lest perchance we should
transfer the joy of Christ to Antichrist.1613 While, therefore, we were considering these
things, there came holy men, Parmenius and Varinus, who said that your Holiness had
found a Hebrew volume, written by the hand of the most blessed Evangelist Matthew, in
which also the birth of the virgin mother herself, and the infancy of our Saviour, were
written. And accordingly we entreat your affection by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, to
render it from the Hebrew into Latin,1614 not so much for the attainment of those things
which are the insignia of Christ, as for the exclusion of the craft of heretics, who, in order
to teach bad doctrine, have mingled their own lies with the excellent nativity of Christ, that
by the sweetness of life they might hide the bitterness of death. It will therefore become
your purest piety, either to listen to us as your brethren entreating, or to let us have as
bishops exacting, the debt of affection which you may deem due.
Reply to Their Letter by Jerome.</p>
<p>To my lords the holy and most blessed Bishops Cromatius and Heliodorus, Jerome, a
humble servant of Christ, in the Lord greeting.</p>
<p>He who digs in ground where he knows that there is gold,1615 does not instantly snatch
at whatever the uptorn trench may pour forth; but, before the stroke of the quivering spade
raises aloft the glittering mass, he meanwhile lingers over the sods to turn them over and
lift them up, and especially he who has not added to his gains. An arduous task is enjoined
upon me, since what your Blessedness has commanded me, the holy Apostle and Evangelist
Matthew himself did not write for the purpose of publishing. For if he had not done it
somewhat secretly, he would have added it also to his Gospel which he published. But he

<pb n="1248"/>
composed this book in Hebrew; and so little did he publish it, that at this day the book
written in Hebrew by his own hand is in the possession of very religious men, to whom in
successive periods of time it has been handed down by those that were before them. And
this book they never at any time gave to any one to translate. And so it came to pass, that
when it was published by a disciple of Manichæus named Leucius, who also wrote the falsely
styled Acts of the Apostles, this book afforded matter, not of edification, but of perdition;
and the opinion of the Synod in regard to it was according to its deserts, that the ears of the
Church should not be open to it. Let the snapping of those that bark against us now cease;
for we do not add this little book to the canonical writings, but we translate what was written
by an Apostle and Evangelist, that we may disclose the falsehood of heresy. In this work,
then, we obey the commands of pious bishops as well as oppose impious heretics. It is the
love of Christ, therefore, which we fulfil, believing that they will assist us by their prayers,
who through our obedience attain to a knowledge of the holy infancy of our Saviour.</p>
<p>There is extant another letter to the same bishops, attributed to Jerome:—</p>
<p>You ask me to let you know what I think of a book held by some to be about the nativity
of St. Mary. And so I wish you to know that there is much in it that is false. For one
Seleucus, who wrote the Sufferings of the Apostles, composed this book. But, just as he
wrote what was true about their powers, and the miracles they worked, but said a great deal
that was false about their doctrine; so here too he has invented many untruths out of his
own head. I shall take care to render it word for word, exactly as it is in the Hebrew, since
it is asserted that it was composed by the holy Evangelist Matthew, and written in Hebrew,
and set at the head of his Gospel. Whether this be true or not, I leave to the author of the
preface and the trustworthiness of the writer: as for myself, I pronounce them doubtful; I
do not affirm that they are clearly false. But this I say freely—and I think none of the faithful
will deny it—that, whether these stories be true or inventions, the sacred nativity of St. Mary
was preceded by great miracles, and succeeded by the greatest; and so by those who believe
that God can do these things, they can be believed and read without damaging their faith
or imperilling their souls. In short, so far as I can, following the sense rather than the words
of the writer, and sometimes walking in the same path, though not in the same footsteps,
sometimes digressing a little, but still keeping the same road, I shall in this way keep by the
style of the narrative, and shall say nothing that is not either written there, or might, following
the same train of thought, have been written.</p>

<p>In those days there was a man in Jerusalem, Joachim by name, of the tribe of Judah.
He was the shepherd of his own sheep, fearing the Lord in integrity and singleness of heart.
He had no other care than that of his herds, from the produce of which he supplied with
food all that feared God, offering double gifts in the fear of God to all who laboured in
doctrine, and who ministered unto Him. Therefore his lambs, and his sheep, and his wool,
and all things whatsoever he possessed, he used to divide into three portions: one he gave
to the orphans, the widows, the strangers, and the poor; the second to those that worshipped
God; and the third he kept for himself and all his house.1617 And as he did so, the Lord
multiplied to him his herds, so that there was no man like him in the people of Israel. This
now he began to do when he was fifteen years old. And at the age of twenty he took to wife
Anna, the daughter of Achar, of his own tribe, that is, of the tribe of Judah, of the family of
David. And though they had lived together for twenty years, he had by her neither sons
nor daughters.1618</p>

<p>And it happened that, in the time of the feast, among those who were offering incense
to the Lord, Joachim stood getting ready his gifts in the sight of the Lord. And the priest,
Ruben by name, coming to him, said: It is not lawful for thee to stand among those who
are doing sacrifice to God, because God has not blessed thee so as to give thee seed in Israel.
Being therefore put to shame in the sight of the people, he retired from the temple of the
Lord weeping, and did not return to his house, but went to his flocks, taking with him his
shepherds into the mountains to a far country, so that for five months his wife Anna could
hear no tidings of him. And she prayed with tears, saying: O Lord, most mighty God of
Israel, why hast Thou, seeing that already Thou hast not given me children, taken from me
my husband also? Behold, now five months that I have not seen my husband; and I know
not where he is tarrying;1619 nor, if I knew him to be dead, could I bury him. And while
she wept excessively, she entered into the court of His house; and she fell on her face in
prayer, and poured out her supplications before the Lord. After this, rising from her prayer,
and lifting her eyes to God, she saw a sparrow’s nest in a laurel tree,1620 and uttered her
voice to the Lord with groaning, and said: Lord God Almighty, who hast given offspring
to every creature, to beasts wild and tame, to serpents, and birds, and fishes, and they all
rejoice over their young ones, Thou hast shut out me alone from the gift of Thy benignity.
For Thou, O God, knowest my heart, that from the beginning of my married life I have
vowed that, if Thou, O God, shouldst give me son or daughter, I would offer them to Thee
in Thy holy temple. And while she was thus speaking, suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared
before her, saying: Be not afraid, Anna, for there is seed for thee in the decree of God; and
all generations even to the end shall wonder at that which shall be born of thee. And when
he had thus spoken, he vanished out of her sight. But she, in fear and dread because she
had seen such a sight, and heard such words, at length went into her bed-chamber, and
threw herself on the bed as if dead. And for a whole day and night she remained in great
trembling and in prayer. And after these things she called to her her servant, and said to
her: Dost thou see me deceived in my widowhood and in great perplexity, and hast thou
been unwilling to come in to me? Then she, with a slight murmur, thus answered and said:
If God hath shut up thy womb, and hath taken away thy husband from thee, what can I do
for thee? And when Anna heard this, she lifted up her voice, and wept aloud.</p>

<p>At the same time there appeared a young man on the mountains to Joachim while he
was feeding his flocks, and said to him: Why dost thou not return to thy wife? And Joachim
said: I have had her for twenty years, and it has not been the will of God to give me children
by her. I have been driven with shame and reproach from the temple of the Lord: why
should I go back to her, when I have been once cast off and utterly despised? Here then will
I remain with my sheep; and so long as in this life God is willing to grant me light, I shall
willingly, by the hands of my servants, bestow their portions upon the poor, and the orphans,
and those that fear God. And when he had thus spoken, the young man said to him: I am
an angel of the Lord, and I have to-day appeared to thy wife when she was weeping and
praying, and have consoled her; and know that she has conceived a daughter from thy seed,
and thou in thy ignorance of this hast left her. She will be in the temple of God, and the
Holy Spirit shall abide in her; and her blessedness shall be greater than that of all the holy
women, so that no one can say that any before her has been like her, or that any after her
in this world will be so. Therefore go down from the mountains, and return to thy wife,
whom thou wilt find with child. For God hath raised up seed in her, and for this thou wilt
give God thanks; and her seed shall be blessed, and she herself shall be blessed, and shall be
made the mother of eternal blessing. Then Joachim adored the angel, and said to him: If I
have found favour in thy sight, sit for a little in my tent, and bless thy servant.1621 And the
angel said to him: Do not say servant, but fellow-servant; for we are the servants of one
Master.1622 But my food is invisible, and my drink cannot be seen by a mortal. Therefore
thou oughtest not to ask me to enter thy tent; but if thou wast about to give me anything,1623
offer it as a burnt-offering to the Lord. Then Joachim took a lamb without spot, and said
to the angel: I should not have dared to offer a burnt-offering to the Lord, unless thy command
had given me the priest’s right of offering.1624 And the angel said to him: I should
not have invited thee to offer unless I had known the will of the Lord. And when Joachim
was offering the sacrifice to God, the angel and the odour of the sacrifice went together
straight up to heaven with the smoke.1625</p>

day even until evening. And his lads and hired servants who were with him saw him, and

with difficulty raised him from the ground. And when he recounted to them the vision of
the angel, they were struck with great fear and wonder, and advised him to accomplish the
vision of the angel without delay, and to go back with all haste to his wife. And when Joachim
was turning over in his mind whether he should go back or not, it happened that he was
overpowered by a deep sleep; and, behold, the angel who had already appeared to him when
awake, appeared to him in his sleep, saying: I am the angel appointed by God as thy
guardian: go down with confidence, and return to Anna, because the deeds of mercy which
thou and thy wife Anna have done have been told in the presence of the Most High; and to
you will God give such fruit as no prophet or saint has ever had from the beginning, or ever
will have. And when Joachim awoke out of his sleep, he called all his herdsmen to him, and
told them his dream. And they worshipped the Lord, and said to him: See that thou no
further despise the words of the angel. But rise and let us go hence, and return at a quiet
pace, feeding our flocks.</p>
<p>And when, after thirty days occupied in going back, they were now near at hand, behold,
the angel of the Lord appeared to Anna, who was standing and praying, and said:1626 Go
to the gate which is called Golden,1627 and meet thy husband in the way, for to-day he will
come to thee. She therefore went towards him in haste with her maidens, and, praying to
the Lord, she stood a long time in the gate waiting for him. And when she was wearied with
long waiting, she lifted up her eyes and saw Joachim afar off coming with his flocks; and
she ran to him and hung on his neck, giving thanks to God, and saying: I was a widow, and
behold now I am not so: I was barren, and behold I have now conceived. And so they
worshipped the Lord, and went into their own house. And when this was heard of, there
was great joy among all their neighbours and acquaintances, so that the whole land of Israel
congratulated them.</p>

<p>After these things, her nine months being fulfilled, Anna brought forth a daughter, and
called her Mary. And having weaned her in her third year, Joachim, and Anna his wife,
went together to the temple of the Lord to offer sacrifices to God, and placed the infant,
Mary by name, in the community of virgins, in which the virgins remained day and night
praising God. And when she was put down before the doors of the temple, she went up the
fifteen steps1628 so swiftly, that she did not look back at all; nor did she, as children are wont
to do, seek for her parents. Whereupon her parents, each of them anxiously seeking for the
child, were both alike astonished, until they found her in the temple, and the priests of the
temple themselves wondered.</p>

<p>And Mary was held in admiration by all the people of Israel; and when she was three
years old, she walked with a step so mature, she spoke so perfectly, and spent her time so
assiduously in the praises of God, that all were astonished at her, and wondered; and she
was not reckoned a young infant, but as it were a grown-up person of thirty years old. She
was so constant in prayer, and her appearance was so beautiful and glorious, that scarcely
any one could look into her face. And she occupied herself constantly with her wool-work,
so that she in her tender years could do all that old women were not able to do. And this
was the order that she had set for herself:1629 From the morning to the third hour she remained
in prayer; from the third to the ninth she was occupied with her weaving; and from
the ninth she again applied herself to prayer. She did not retire from praying until there
appeared to her the angel of the Lord, from whose hand she used to receive food; and thus
she became more and more perfect in the work of God. Then, when the older virgins rested
from the praises of God, she did not rest at all; so that in the praises and vigils of God none
were found before her, no one more learned in the wisdom of the law of God, more lowly
in humility, more elegant in singing, more perfect in all virtue. She was indeed stedfast,
immoveable, unchangeable, and daily advancing to perfection. No one saw her angry, nor
heard her speaking evil. All her speech was so full of grace, that her God was acknowledged
to be in her tongue. She was always engaged in prayer and in searching the law, and she
was anxious lest by any word of hers she should sin with regard to her companions. Then
she was afraid lest in her laughter, or the sound of her beautiful voice, she should commit
any fault, or lest, being elated, she should display any wrong-doing or haughtiness to one
of her equals.1630 She blessed God without intermission; and lest perchance, even in her
salutation, she might cease from praising God; if any one saluted her, she used to answer
by way of salutation: Thanks be to God. And from her the custom first began of men saying,
Thanks be to God, when they saluted each other. She refreshed herself only with the food
which she daily received from the hand of the angel; but the food which she obtained from
the priests she divided among the poor. The angels of God were often seen speaking with
her, and they most diligently obeyed her. If any one who was unwell touched her, the same
hour he went home cured.</p>

<p>Then Abiathar the priest offered gifts without end to the high priests, in order that he
might obtain her as wife to his son. But Mary forbade them, saying: It cannot be that I
should know a man, or that a man should know me. For all the priests and all her relations
kept saying to her: God is worshipped in children and adored in posterity, as has always
happened among the sons of Israel. But Mary answered and said unto them: God is worshipped
in chastity, as is proved first of all.1631 For before Abel there was none righteous
among men, and he by his offerings pleased God, and was without mercy slain by him who
displeased Him. Two crowns, therefore, he received—of oblation and of virginity, because
in his flesh there was no pollution. Elias also, when he was in the flesh, was taken up in the
flesh, because he kept his flesh unspotted. Now I, from my infancy in the temple of God,
have learned that virginity can be sufficiently dear to God. And so, because I can offer what
is dear to God, I have resolved in my heart that I should not know a man at all.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, when she was fourteen1632 years old, and on this account there
was occasion for the Pharisees’ saying that it was now a custom that no woman of that age
should abide in the temple of God, they fell upon the plan of sending a herald through all
the tribes of Israel, that on the third day all should come together into the temple of the
Lord. And when all the people had come together, Abiathar the high priest rose, and
mounted on a higher step, that he might be seen and heard by all the people; and when great
silence had been obtained, he said: Hear me, O sons of Israel, and receive my words into
your ears. Ever since this temple was built by Solomon, there have been in it virgins, the
daughters of kings and the daughters of prophets, and of high priests and priests; and they
were great, and worthy of admiration. But when they came to the proper age they were
given in marriage, and followed the course of their mothers before them, and were pleasing
to God. But a new order of life has been found out by Mary alone, who promises that she
will remain a virgin to God. Wherefore it seems to me, that through our inquiry and the
answer of God we should try to ascertain to whose keeping she ought to be entrusted. Then
these words found favour with all the synagogue. And the lot was cast by the priests upon
the twelve tribes, and the lot fell upon the tribe of Judah. And the priest said: To-morrow
let every one who has no wife come, and bring his rod in his hand. Whence it happened
that Joseph1633 brought his rod along with the young men. And the rods having been
handed over to the high priest, he offered a sacrifice to the Lord God, and inquired of the
Lord. And the Lord said to him: Put all their rods into the holy of holies of God, and let
them remain there, and order them to come to thee on the morrow to get back their rods;
and the man from the point of whose rod a dove shall come forth, and fly towards heaven,
and in whose hand the rod, when given back, shall exhibit this sign, to him let Mary be delivered
to be kept.</p>
<p>On the following day, then, all having assembled early, and an incense-offering having
been made, the high priest went into the holy of holies, and brought forth the rods. And
when he had distributed the rods,1634 and the dove came forth out of none of them, the
high priest put on the twelve bells1635 and the sacerdotal robe; and entering into the holy
of holies, he there made a burnt-offering, and poured forth a prayer. And the angel of the
Lord appeared to him, saying: There is here the shortest rod, of which thou hast made no
account: thou didst bring it in with the rest, but didst not take it out with them. When thou
hast taken it out, and hast given it him whose it is, in it will appear the sign of which I spoke

to thee. Now that was Joseph’s rod; and because he was an old man, he had been cast off,
as it were, that he might not receive her, but neither did he himself wish to ask back his
rod.1636 And when he was humbly standing last of all, the high priest cried out to him with
a loud voice, saying: Come, Joseph, and receive thy rod; for we are waiting for thee. And
Joseph came up trembling, because the high priest had called him with a very loud voice.
But as soon as he stretched forth his hand, and laid hold of his rod, immediately from the
top of it came forth a dove whiter than snow, beautiful exceedingly, which, after long flying
about the roofs of the temple, at length flew towards the heavens. Then all the people congratulated
the old man, saying: Thou hast been made blessed in thine old age, O father
Joseph, seeing that God hath shown thee to be fit to receive Mary. And the priests having
said to him, Take her, because of all the tribe of Judah thou alone hast been chosen by God;
Joseph began bashfully to address them, saying: I am an old man, and have children; why
do you hand over to me this infant, who is younger than my grandsons? Then Abiathar the
high priest said to him: Remember, Joseph, how Dathan and Abiron and Core perished,
because they despised the will of God. So will it happen to thee, if thou despise this which
is commanded thee by God. Joseph answered him: I indeed do not despise the will of God;
but I shall be her guardian until I can ascertain concerning the will of God, as to which of
my sons can have her as his wife. Let some virgins of her companions, with whom she may
meanwhile spend her time, be given for a consolation to her. Abiathar the high priest
answered and said: Five virgins indeed shall be given her for consolation, until the appointed
day come in which thou mayst receive her; for to no other can she be joined in marriage.</p>
<p>Then Joseph received Mary, with the other five virgins who were to be with her in
Joseph’s house. These virgins were Rebecca, Sephora, Susanna, Abigea, and Cael; to whom
the high priest gave the silk, and the blue,1637 and the fine linen, and the scarlet, and the
purple, and the fine flax. For they cast lots among themselves what each virgin should do,
and the purple for the veil of the temple of the Lord fell to the lot of Mary. And when she
had got it, those virgins said to her: Since thou art the last, and humble, and younger than
all, thou hast deserved to receive and obtain the purple. And thus saying, as it were in words
of annoyance, they began to call her queen of virgins. While, however, they were so doing,
the angel of the Lord appeared in the midst of them, saying: These words shall not have
been uttered by way of annoyance, but prophesied as a prophecy most true. They trembled,
therefore, at the sight of the angel, and at his words, and asked her to pardon them, and
pray for them.</p>
<note type="footnote">1636 Another and more probable reading is: And this was Joseph’s rod; and he was of an abject appearance,

by means of thee will shine over the whole world.</p>
<p>Again, on the third day, while she was working at the purple with her fingers, there
entered a young man of ineffable beauty. And when Mary saw him, she exceedingly feared
and trembled. And he said to her: Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee: blessed
art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.1638 And when she heard these
words, she trembled, and was exceedingly afraid. Then the angel of the Lord added: Fear
not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God: Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,

<p>While these things were doing, Joseph was occupied with his work, house-building, in
the districts by the sea-shore; for he was a carpenter. And after nine months he came back
to his house, and found Mary pregnant. Wherefore, being in the utmost distress, he trembled
and cried out, saying: O Lord God, receive my spirit; for it is better for me to die than to
live any longer. And the virgins who were with Mary said to him: Joseph, what art thou
saying? We know that no man has touched her; we can testify that she is still a virgin, and
untouched. We have watched over her; always has she continued with us in prayer; daily
do the angels of God speak with her; daily does she receive food from the hand of the Lord.
We know not how it is possible that there can be any sin in her. But if thou wishest us to
tell thee what we suspect, nobody but the angel of the Lord1639 has made her pregnant.
Then said Joseph: Why do you mislead me, to believe that an angel of the Lord has made
her pregnant? But it is possible that some one has pretended to be an angel of the Lord, and
has beguiled her. And thus speaking, he wept, and said: With what face shall I look at the
temple of the Lord, or with what face shall I see the priests of God? What am I to do? And
thus saying, he thought that he would flee, and send her away.</p>

<p>And when he was thinking of rising up and hiding himself, and dwelling in secret, behold,
on that very night, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in sleep, saying: Joseph, thou son
of David, fear not; receive Mary as thy wife: for that which is in her womb is of the Holy
Spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called Jesus, for He will save
His people from their sins. And Joseph, rising from his sleep, gave thanks to God, and spoke
to Mary and the virgins who were with her, and told them his vision. And he was comforted
about Mary, saying: I have sinned, in that I suspected thee at all.</p>

<p>After these things there arose a great report that Mary was with child. And Joseph was
seized by the officers of the temple, and brought along with Mary to the high priest. And
he with the priests began to reproach him, and to say: Why hast thou beguiled so great and
so glorious a virgin, who was fed like a dove in the temple by the angels of God, who never
wished either to see or to have a man, who had the most excellent knowledge of the law of
God? If thou hadst not done violence to her, she would still have remained in her virginity.
And Joseph vowed, and swore that he had never touched her at all. And Abiathar the high
priest answered him: As the Lord liveth, I will give thee to drink of the water of drinking
of the Lord, and immediately thy sin will appear.</p>
<p>Then was assembled a multitude of people which could not be numbered, and Mary
was brought to the temple. And the priests, and her relatives, and her parents wept, and
said to Mary: Confess to the priests thy sin, thou that wast like a dove in the temple of God,
and didst receive food from the hands of an angel. And again Joseph was summoned to the
altar, and the water of drinking of the Lord was given him to drink. And when any one that
had lied drank this water, and walked seven times round the altar, God used to show some
sign in his face. When, therefore, Joseph had drunk in safety, and had walked round the
altar seven times, no sign of sin appeared in him. Then all the priests, and the officers, and
the people justified him, saying: Blessed art thou, seeing that no charge has been found
good against thee. And they summoned Mary, and said: And what excuse canst thou have?
or what greater sign can appear in thee than the conception of thy womb, which betrays
thee? This only we require of thee, that since Joseph is pure regarding thee, thou confess
who it is that has beguiled thee. For it is better that thy confession should betray thee, than
that the wrath of God should set a mark on thy face, and expose thee in the midst of the
people. Then Mary said, stedfastly and without trembling: O Lord God, King over all, who
knowest all secrets, if there be any pollution in me, or any sin, or any evil desires, or unchastity,
expose me in the sight of all the people, and make me an example of punishment
to all. Thus saying, she went up to the altar of the Lord boldly, and drank the water of
drinking, and walked round the altar seven times, and no spot was found in her.</p>
<p>And when all the people were in the utmost astonishment, seeing that she was with
child, and that no sign had appeared in her face, they began to be disturbed among themselves
by conflicting statements: some said that she was holy and unspotted, others that she was
wicked and defiled. Then Mary, seeing that she was still suspected by the people, and that
on that account she did not seem to them to be wholly cleared, said in the hearing of all,
with a loud voice, As the Lord Adonai liveth, the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand, I have
not known man; but I am known by Him to whom from my earliest years I have devoted
myself. And this vow I made to my God from my infancy, that I should remain unspotted
in Him who created me, and I trust that I shall so live to Him alone, and serve Him alone;

<pb n="1263"/>
and in Him, as long as I shall live, will I remain unpolluted. Then they all began to kiss her
feet and to embrace her knees, asking her to pardon them for their wicked suspicions. And
she was led down to her house with exultation and joy by the people, and the priests, and
all the virgins. And they cried out, and said: Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever, because
He hath manifested thy holiness to all His people Israel.</p>

<p>And it came to pass some little time after, that an enrolment was made according to the
edict of Cæsar Augustus, that all the world was to be enrolled, each man in his native place.
This enrolment was made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria.1640 It was necessary, therefore,
that Joseph should enrol with the blessed Mary in Bethlehem, because to it they belonged,
being of the tribe of Judah, and of the house and family of David. When, therefore, Joseph
and the blessed Mary were going along the road which leads to Bethlehem, Mary said to
Joseph: I see two peoples before me, the one weeping, and the other rejoicing. And Joseph
answered: Sit still on thy beast, and do not speak superfluous words. Then there appeared
before them a beautiful boy, clothed in white raiment, who said to Joseph: Why didst thou
say that the words which Mary spoke about the two peoples were superfluous? For she saw
the people of the Jews weeping, because they have departed from their God; and the people
of the Gentiles rejoicing, because they have now been added and made near to the Lord,
according to that which He promised to our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for the time
is at hand when in the seed of Abraham all nations shall be blessed.1641</p>
<p>And when he had thus said, the angel ordered the beast to stand, for the time when she
should bring forth was at hand; and he commanded the blessed Mary to come down off the
animal, and go into a recess under a cavern, in which there never was light, but always
darkness, because the light of day could not reach it. And when the blessed Mary had gone
into it, it began to shine with as much brightness as if it were the sixth hour of the day. The
light from God so shone in the cave, that neither by day nor night was light wanting as long
as the blessed Mary was there. And there she brought forth a son, and the angels surrounded
Him when He was being born. And as soon as He was born, He stood upon His feet, and
the angels adored Him, saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of
good pleasure.1642 Now, when the birth of the Lord was at hand, Joseph had gone away to
seek midwives. And when he had found them, he returned to the cave, and found with
Mary the infant which she had brought forth. And Joseph said to the blessed Mary: I have
brought thee two midwives—Zelomi1643 and Salome; and they are standing outside before
the entrance to the cave, not daring to come in hither, because of the exceeding brightness.
And when the blessed Mary heard this, she smiled; and Joseph said to her: Do not smile;
but prudently allow them to visit thee, in case thou shouldst require them for thy cure.
Then she ordered them to enter. And when Zelomi had come in, Salome having stayed

<pb n="1265"/>
without, Zelomi said to Mary: Allow me to touch thee. And when she had permitted her
to make an examination, the midwife cried out with a loud voice, and said: Lord, Lord
Almighty, mercy on us! It has never been heard or thought of, that any one should have
her breasts full of milk, and that the birth of a son should show his mother to be a virgin.
But there has been no spilling of blood in his birth, no pain in bringing him forth. A virgin
has conceived, a virgin has brought forth, and a virgin she remains. And hearing these
words, Salome said: Allow me to handle thee, and prove whether Zelomi have spoken the
truth. And the blessed Mary allowed her to handle her. And when she had withdrawn her
hand from handling her, it dried up, and through excess of pain she began to weep bitterly,
and to be in great distress, crying out, and saying: O Lord God, Thou knowest that I have
always feared Thee, and that without recompense I have cared for all the poor; I have taken
nothing from the widow and the orphan, and the needy have I not sent empty away. And,
behold, I am made wretched because of mine unbelief, since without a cause I wished to try
Thy virgin.</p>
<p>And while she was thus speaking, there stood by her a young man in shining garments,
saying: Go to the child, and adore Him, and touch Him with thy hand, and He will heal
thee, because He is the Saviour of the world, and of all that hope in Him. And she went to
the child with haste, and adored Him, and touched the fringe of the cloths in which He was
wrapped, and instantly her hand was cured. And going forth, she began to cry aloud, and
to tell the wonderful things which she had seen, and which she had suffered, and how she
had been cured; so that many through her statements believed.</p>
<p>And some shepherds also affirmed that they had seen angels singing a hymn at midnight,
praising and blessing the God of heaven, and saying: There has been born the Saviour of
all, who is Christ the Lord, in whom salvation shall be brought back to Israel.1644</p>
<p>Moreover, a great star, larger than any that had been seen since the beginning of the
world, shone over the cave from the evening till the morning. And the prophets who were
in Jerusalem said that this star pointed out the birth of Christ, who should restore the
promise not only to Israel, but to all nations.</p>

not taste of death till he had seen Christ, the Son of God, living in the flesh. And having
seen the child, he cried out with a loud voice, saying: God hath visited His people, and the
Lord hath fulfilled His promise. And he made haste, and adored Him. And after this he
took Him up into his cloak and kissed His feet, and said: Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word: for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou
hast prepared before the face of all peoples, to be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
of Thy people Israel.1650</p>
<p>There was also in the temple of the Lord, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
of the tribe of Asher, who had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity; and
she had now been a widow eighty-four years. And she never left the temple of the Lord,
but spent her time in fasting and prayer. She also likewise adored the child, saying: In Him
is the redemption of the world.1651</p>

<p>And when the second year was past,1652 Magi came from the east to Jerusalem, bringing
great gifts. And they made strict inquiry of the Jews, saying: Where is the king who has
been born to you? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him. And
word of this came to King Herod, and so alarmed him that he called together the scribes
and the Pharisees, and the teachers of the people, asking of them where the prophets had
foretold that Christ should be born. And they said: In Bethlehem of Judah. For it is written:
And thou Bethelehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the least among the princes of
Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Leader who shall rule my people Israel.1653 Then
King Herod summoned the magi to him, and strictly inquired of them when the star appeared
to them. Then, sending them to Bethlehem, he said: Go and make strict inquiry about the
child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship
him also. And while the magi were going on their way, there appeared to them the star,
which was, as it were, a guide to them, going before them until they came to where the child
was. And when the magi saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy; and going into the house,
they saw the child Jesus sitting in His mother’s lap. Then they opened their treasures, and
presented great gifts to the blessed Mary and Joseph. And to the child Himself they offered
each of them a piece of gold.1654 And likewise one gave gold, another frankincense, and
the third myrrh.1655 And when they were going to return to King Herod, they were warned
by an angel in their sleep not to go back to Herod; and they returned to their own country
by another road.1656</p>

<p>And having come to a certain cave, and wishing to rest in it, the blessed1660 Mary dismounted
from her beast, and sat down with the child Jesus in her bosom. And there were
with Joseph three boys, and with Mary a girl, going on the journey along with them. And,
lo, suddenly there came forth from the cave many dragons; and when the children saw them,
they cried out in great terror. Then Jesus went down from the bosom of His mother, and
stood on His feet before the dragons; and they adored Jesus, and thereafter retired. Then
was fulfilled that which was said by David the prophet, saying: Praise the Lord from the
earth, ye dragons; ye dragons, and all ye deeps.1661 And the young child Jesus, walking before
them, commanded them to hurt no man. But Mary and Joseph were very much afraid lest
the child should be hurt by the dragons. And Jesus said to them: Do not be afraid, and do
not consider me to be a little child; for I am and always have been perfect; and all the beasts
of the forest must needs be tame before me.</p>
<note type="footnote">1660 One of themss. has: Then Joseph put the blessed virgin and the boy upon a beast, and himself mounted

<p>Lions and panthers adored Him likewise, and accompanied them in the desert. Wherever
Joseph and the blessed Mary went, they went before them showing them the way, and
bowing their heads; and showing their submission by wagging their tails, they adored Him
with great reverence. Now at first, when Mary saw the lions and the panthers, and various
kinds of wild beasts, coming about them, she was very much afraid. But the infant Jesus
looked into her face with a joyful countenance, and said: Be not afraid, mother; for they
come not to do thee harm, but they make haste to serve both thee and me. With these words
He drove all fear from her heart. And the lions kept walking with them, and with the oxen,
and the asses, and the beasts of burden which carried their baggage, and did not hurt a single
one of them, though they kept beside them; but they were tame among the sheep and the
rams which they had brought with them from Judæa, and which they had with them. They
walked among wolves, and feared nothing; and no one of them was hurt by another. Then
was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet: Wolves shall feed with lambs; the lion
and the ox shall eat straw together.1662 There were together two oxen drawing a waggon
with provision for the journey, and the lions directed them in their path.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the third day of their journey, while they were walking, that the
blessed Mary was fatigued by the excessive heat of the sun in the desert; and seeing a palm
tree, she said to Joseph: Let me rest a little under the shade of this tree. Joseph therefore
made haste, and led her to the palm, and made her come down from her beast. And as the
blessed Mary was sitting there, she looked up to the foliage of the palm, and saw it full of
fruit, and said to Joseph: I wish it were possible to get some of the fruit of this palm. And
Joseph said to her: I wonder that thou sayest this, when thou seest how high the palm tree
is; and that thou thinkest of eating of its fruit. I am thinking more of the want of water,
because the skins are now empty, and we have none wherewith to refresh ourselves and our
cattle. Then the child Jesus, with a joyful countenance, reposing in the bosom of His
mother, said to the palm: O tree, bend thy branches, and refresh my mother with thy fruit.
And immediately at these words the palm bent its top down to the very feet of the blessed
Mary; and they gathered from it fruit, with which they were all refreshed. And after they
had gathered all its fruit, it remained bent down, waiting the order to rise from Him who
had commanded it to stoop. Then Jesus said to it: Raise thyself, O palm tree, and be strong,
and be the companion of my trees, which are in the paradise of my Father; and open from
thy roots a vein of water which has been hid in the earth, and let the waters flow, so that we
may be satisfied from thee. And it rose up immediately, and at its root there began to come
forth a spring of water exceedingly clear and cool and sparkling. And when they saw the
spring of water, they rejoiced with great joy, and were satisfied, themselves and all their
cattle and their beasts. Wherefore they gave thanks to God.</p>

<p>And on the day after, when they were setting out thence, and in the hour in which they
began their journey, Jesus turned to the palm, and said: This privilege I give thee, O palm
tree, that one of thy branches be carried away by my angels, and planted in the paradise of
my Father. And this blessing I will confer upon thee, that it shall be said of all who conquer
in any contest, You have attained the palm of victory. And while He was thus speaking,
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and stood upon the palm tree; and taking off one of
its branches, flew to heaven with the branch in his hand. And when they saw this, they fell
on their faces, and became as it were dead. And Jesus said to them: Why are your hearts
possessed with fear? Do you not know that this palm, which I have caused to be transferred
to paradise, shall be prepared for all the saints in the place of delights, as it has been prepared
for us in this place of the wilderness? And they were filled with joy; and being strengthened,

<p>After this, while they were going on their journey, Joseph said to Jesus: Lord, it is a
boiling heat; if it please Thee, let us go by the sea-shore, that we may be able to rest in the
cities on the coast. Jesus said to him: Fear not, Joseph; I will shorten the way for you, so
that what you would have taken thirty days to go over, you shall accomplish in this one day.
And while they were thus speaking, behold, they looked forward, and began to see the
mountains and cities of Egypt.</p>
<p>And rejoicing and exulting, they came into the regions of Hermopolis, and entered into
a certain city of Egypt which is called Sotinen;1663 and because they knew no one there from
whom they could ask hospitality, they went into a temple which was called the Capitol of
Egypt. And in this temple there had been set up three hundred and fifty-five idols,1664 to
each of which on its own day divine honours and sacred rites were paid. For the Egyptians
belonging to the same city entered the Capitol, in which the priests told them how many
sacrifices were offered each day, according to the honour in which the god was held.</p>

vengeance taken on those on whose account the gods had fallen down. But when he came
into the temple, and saw all the gods lying prostrate on their faces, he went up to the blessed
Mary, who was carrying the Lord in her bosom, and adored Him, and said to all his army
and all his friends: Unless this were the God of our gods, our gods would not have fallen
on their faces before Him; nor would they be lying prostrate in His presence: wherefore
they silently confess that He is their Lord. Unless we, therefore, take care to do what we
have seen our gods doing, we may run the risk of His anger, and all come to destruction,
even as it happened to Pharaoh king of the Egyptians, who, not believing in powers so
mighty, was drowned in the sea, with all his army.1667 Then all the people of that same city

<p>And it came to pass, after Jesus had returned out of Egypt, when He was in Galilee, and
entering on the fourth year of His age, that on a Sabbath-day He was playing with some
children at the bed of the Jordan. And as He sat there, Jesus made to Himself seven pools
of clay, and to each of them He made passages, through which at His command He brought
water from the torrent into the pool, and took it back again. Then one of those children, a
son of the devil, moved with envy, shut the passages which supplied the pools with water,
and overthrew what Jesus had built up. Then said Jesus to him: Woe unto thee, thou son
of death, thou son of Satan! Dost thou destroy the works which I have wrought? And immediately
he who had done this died. Then with great uproar the parents of the dead boy
cried out against Mary and Joseph, saying to them: Your son has cursed our son, and he is
dead. And when Joseph and Mary heard this, they came forthwith to Jesus, on account of
the outcry of the parents of the boy, and the gathering together of the Jews. But Joseph said
privately to Mary: I dare not speak to Him; but do thou admonish Him, and say: Why hast
Thou raised against us the hatred of the people; and why must the troublesome hatred of
men be borne by us? And His mother having come to Him, asked Him, saying: My Lord,
what was it that he did to bring about his death? And He said: He deserved death, because
he scattered the works that I had made. Then His mother asked Him, saying: Do not so,
my Lord, because all men rise up against us. But He, not wishing to grieve His mother, with
His right foot kicked the hinder parts of the dead boy, and said to him: Rise, thou son of
iniquity for thou art not worthy to enter into the rest of my Father, because thou didst destroy
the works which I had made. Then he who had been dead rose up, and went away. And
Jesus, by the word of His power, brought water into the pools by the aqueduct.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, after these things, that in the sight of all Jesus took clay from the
pools which He had made, and of it made twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when
Jesus did this, and there were very many children with Him. When, therefore, one of the
Jews had seen Him doing this, he said to Joseph: Joseph, dost thou not see the child Jesus
working on the Sabbath at what it is not lawful for him to do? for he has made twelve sparrows
of clay. And when Joseph heard this, he reproved him, saying: Wherefore doest thou
on the Sabbath such things as are not lawful for us to do? And when Jesus heard Joseph,
He struck His hands together, and said to His sparrows: Fly! And at the voice of His command
they began to fly. And in the sight and hearing of all that stood by, He said to the
birds: Go and fly through the earth, and through all the world, and live. And when those
that were there saw such miracles, they were filled with great astonishment. And some
praised and admired Him, but others reviled Him. And certain of them went away to the
chief priests and the heads of the Pharisees, and reported to them that Jesus the son of Joseph
had done great signs and miracles in the sight of all the people of Israel. And this was reported
in the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>And again the son of Annas, a priest of the temple, who had come with Joseph, holding
his rod in his hand in the sight of all, with great fury broke down the dams which Jesus had
made with His own hands, and let out the water which He had collected in them from the
torrent. Moreover, he shut the aqueduct by which the water came in, and then broke it
down. And when Jesus saw this, He said to that boy who had destroyed His dams: O most
wicked seed of iniquity! O son of death! O workshop of Satan! verily the fruit of thy seed
shall be without strength, and thy roots without moisture, and thy branches withered,
bearing no fruit. And immediately, in the sight of all, the boy withered away, and died.</p>

<p>Then Joseph trembled, and took hold of Jesus, and went with Him to his own house,
and His mother with Him. And, behold, suddenly from the opposite direction a boy, also
a worker of iniquity, ran up and came against the shoulder of Jesus, wishing to make sport
of Him, or to hurt Him, if he could. And Jesus said to him: Thou shalt not go back safe
and sound from the way that thou goest. And immediately he fell down, and died. And
the parents of the dead boy, who had seen what happened, cried out, saying: Where does
this child come from? It is manifest that every word that he says is true; and it is often accomplished
before he speaks. And the parents of the dead boy came to Joseph, and said to
him: Take away that Jesus from this place, for he cannot live with us in this town; or at least
teach him to bless, and not to curse. And Joseph came up to Jesus, and admonished Him,
saying: Why doest thou such things? For already many are in grief and against thee, and
hate us on thy account, and we endure the reproaches of men because of thee. And Jesus
answered and said unto Joseph: No one is a wise son but he whom his father hath taught,
according to the knowledge of this time; and a father’s curse can hurt none but evil-doers.
Then they came together against Jesus, and accused him to Joseph. When Joseph saw this,
he was in great terror, fearing the violence and uproar of the people of Israel. And the same
hour Jesus seized the dead boy by the ear, and lifted him up from the earth in the sight of
all: and they saw Jesus speaking to him like a father to his son. And his spirit came back to

<p>Now a certain Jewish schoolmaster named Zachyas1669 heard Jesus thus speaking; and
seeing that He could not be overcome, from knowing the power that was in Him,1670 he
became angry, and began rudely and foolishly, and without fear, to speak against Joseph.
And he said: Dost thou not wish to entrust me with thy son, that he may be instructed in
human learning and in reverence? But I see that Mary and thyself have more regard for
your son than for what the elders of the people of Israel say against him. You should have
given more honour to us, the elders of the whole church of Israel, both that he might be on
terms of mutual affection with the children, and that among us he might be instructed in
Jewish learning. Joseph, on the other hand, said to him: And is there any one who can keep
this child, and teach him? But if thou canst keep him and teach him, we by no means hinder
him from being taught by thee those things which are learned by all. And Jesus, having
heard what Zachyas had said, answered and said unto him: The precepts of the law which
thou hast just spoken of, and all the things that thou hast named, must be kept by those who
are instructed in human learning; but I am a stranger to your law-courts, because I have no
father after the flesh. Thou who readest the law, and art learned in it, abidest in the law; but
I was before the law. But since thou thinkest that no one is equal to thee in learning, thou
shalt be taught by me, that no other can teach anything but those things which thou hast
named. But he alone can who is worthy.1671 For when I shall be exalted on earth, I will
cause to cease all mention of your genealogy. For thou knowest not when thou wast born:
I alone know when you were born, and how long your life on earth will be. Then all who
heard these words were struck with astonishment, and cried out: Oh! oh! oh! this marvellously
great and wonderful mystery. Never have we heard the like! Never has it been heard
from any one else, nor has it been said or at any time heard by the prophets, or the Pharisees,
or the scribes. We know whence he is sprung, and he is scarcely five years old; and whence
does he speak these words? The Pharisees answered: We have never heard such words
spoken by any other child so young. And Jesus answered and said unto them: At this do
ye wonder, that such things are said by a child? Why, then, do ye not believe me in those
things which I have said to you? And you all wonder because I said to you that I know when
you were born. I will tell you greater things, that you may wonder more. I have seen Abraham,
whom you call your father, and have spoken with him; and he has seen me.1672 And

when they heard this they held their tongues, nor did any of them dare to speak. And Jesus

younger than I am,1673 and of little faith.</p>

<p>A second time the master Zachyas, doctor of the law, said to Joseph and Mary: Give
me the boy, and I shall hand him over to master Levi, who shall teach him his letters and
instruct him. Then Joseph and Mary, soothing Jesus, took Him to the schools, that He might
be taught His letters by old Levi. And as soon as He went in He held His tongue. And the
master Levi said one letter to Jesus, and, beginning from the first letter Aleph, said to Him:
Answer. But Jesus was silent, and answered nothing. Wherefore the preceptor Levi was
angry, and seized his storax-tree rod, and struck Him on the head. And Jesus said to the
teacher Levi: Why dost thou strike me? Thou shalt know in truth, that He who is struck
can teach him who strikes Him more than He can be taught by him. For I can teach you
those very things that you are saying. But all these are blind who speak and hear, like
sounding brass or tinkling cymbal, in which there is no perception of those things which
are meant by their sound.1674 And Jesus in addition said to Zachyas: Every letter from
Aleph even to Thet1675 is known by its arrangement. Say thou first, therefore, what Thet
is, and I will tell thee what Aleph is. And again Jesus said to them: Those who do not know
Aleph, how can they say Thet, the hypocrites? Tell me what the first one, Aleph, is; and I
shall then believe you when you have said Beth. And Jesus began to ask the names of the
letters one by one, and said: Let the master of the law tell us what the first letter is, or why
it has many triangles, gradate, subacute, mediate, obduced, produced, erect, prostrate,
curvistrate.1676 And when Levi heard this, he was thunderstruck at such an arrangement
of the names of the letters. Then he began in the hearing of all to cry out, and say: Ought
such a one to live on the earth? Yea, he ought to be hung on the great cross. For he can put
out fire, and make sport of other modes of punishment. I think that he lived before the
flood, and was born before the deluge. For what womb bore him? or what mother brought
him forth? or what breasts gave him suck? I flee before him; I am not able to withstand the
words from his mouth, but my heart is astounded to hear such words. I do not think that

voice to all the sons of Israel standing by and hearing: Let the unfruitful bring forth fruit,
and the blind see, and the lame walk right, and the poor enjoy the good things of this life,
and the dead live, that each may return to his original state, and abide in Him who is the
root of life and of perpetual sweetness. And when the child Jesus had said this, forthwith
all who had fallen under malignant diseases were restored. And they did not dare to say
anything more to Him, or to hear anything from Him.</p>

<p>After these things, Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus into the city of Nazareth;
and He remained there with His parents. And on the first of the week, when Jesus was
playing with the children on the roof of a certain house, it happened that one of the children
pushed another down from the roof to the ground, and he was killed. And the parents of
the dead boy, who had not seen this, cried out against Joseph and Mary, saying: Your son
has thrown our son down to the ground, and he is dead. But Jesus was silent, and answered
them nothing. And Joseph and Mary came in haste to Jesus; and His mother asked Him,
saying: My lord, tell me if thou didst throw him down. And immediately Jesus went down
from the roof to the ground, and called the boy by his name, Zeno. And he answered Him:
My lord. And Jesus said to him: Was it I that threw thee down from the roof to the ground?
And he said: No, my lord. And the parents of the boy who had been dead wondered, and
honoured Jesus for the miracle that had been wrought. And Joseph and Mary departed
thence with Jesus to Jericho.</p>

to draw water with the children. And it came to pass, after He had drawn the water, that
one of the children came against Him, and struck the pitcher, and broke it. But Jesus
stretched out the cloak which He had on, and took up in His cloak as much water as there
had been in the pitcher, and carried it to His mother. And when she saw it she wondered,
and reflected within herself, and laid up all these things in her heart.1678</p>

<p>There is a road going out of Jericho and leading to the river Jordan, to the place where
the children of Israel crossed: and there the ark of the covenant is said to have rested. And
Jesus was eight years old, and He went out of Jericho, and went towards the Jordan. And
there was beside the road, near the bank of the Jordan, a cave where a lioness was nursing
her cubs; and no one was safe to walk that way. Jesus then, coming from Jericho, and
knowing that in that cave the lioness had brought forth her young, went into it in the sight
of all. And when the lions saw Jesus, they ran to meet Him, and adored Him. And Jesus
was sitting in the cavern, and the lion’s cubs ran hither and thither round His feet, fawning
upon Him, and sporting. And the older lions, with their heads bowed down, stood at a
distance, and adored Him, and fawned upon Him with their tails. Then the people who
were standing afar off, not seeing Jesus, said: Unless he or his parents had committed
grievous sins, he would not of his own accord have offered himself up to the lions. And
when the people were thus reflecting within themselves, and were lying under great sorrow,
behold, on a sudden, in the sight of the people, Jesus came out of the cave, and the lions
went before Him, and the lion’s cubs played with each other before His feet. And the parents
of Jesus stood afar off, with their heads bowed down, and watched; likewise also the people
stood at a distance, on account of the lions; for they did not dare to come close to them.
Then Jesus began to say to the people: How much better are the beasts than you, seeing
that they recognise their Lord, and glorify Him; while you men, who have been made after
the image and likeness of God, do not know Him! Beasts know me, and are tame; men see
me, and do not acknowledge me.</p>

until you return to the place whence you have come forth. And they, bidding Him farewell,
not only with their gestures but with their voices, went to their own place. But Jesus returned
to His mother.</p>

<p>Now Joseph1682 was a carpenter, and used to make nothing else of wood but ox-yokes,
and ploughs, and implements of husbandry, and wooden beds. And it came to pass that a
certain young man ordered him to make for him a couch six cubits long. And Joseph
commanded his servant1683 to cut the wood with an iron saw, according to the measure
which he had sent. But he did not keep to the prescribed measure, but made one piece of
wood shorter than the other. And Joseph was in perplexity, and began to consider what he
was to do about this. And when Jesus saw him in this state of cogitation, seeing that it was
a matter of impossibility to him, He addresses him with words of comfort, saying: Come,
let us take hold of the ends of the pieces of wood, and let us put them together, end to end,
and let us fit them exactly to each other, and draw to us, for we shall be able to make them
equal. Then Joseph did what he was bid, for he knew that He could do whatever He wished.
And Joseph took hold of the ends of the pieces of wood, and brought them together against
the wall next himself, and Jesus took hold of the other ends of the pieces of wood, and drew
the shorter piece to Him, and made it of the same length as the longer one. And He said to
Joseph: Go and work, and do what thou hast promised to do. And Joseph did what he had
promised.1684</p>

<p>And it came to pass a second time, that Joseph and Mary were asked by the people that
Jesus should be taught His letters in school. They did not refuse to do so; and according to
the commandment of the elders, they took Him to a master to be instructed in human
learning. Then the master began to teach Him in an imperious tone, saying: Say Alpha.1685
And Jesus said to him: Do thou tell me first what Betha is, and I will tell thee what Alpha
is. And upon this the master got angry and struck Jesus; and no sooner had he struck Him,
than he fell down dead.</p>
<p>And Jesus went home again to His mother. And Joseph, being afraid, called Mary to
him, and said to her: Know of a surety that my soul is sorrowful even unto death on account
of this child. For it is very likely that at some time or other some one will strike him in
malice, and he will die. But Mary answered and said: O man of God! do not believe that
this is possible. You may believe to a certainty that He who has sent him to be born among
men will Himself guard him from all mischief, and will in His own name preserve him from
evil.</p>

<p>Again the Jews asked Mary and Joseph a third time to coax Him to go to another master
to learn. And Joseph and Mary, fearing the people, and the overbearing of the princes, and
the threats of the priests, led Him again to school, knowing that He could learn nothing
from man, because He had perfect knowledge from God only. And when Jesus had entered
the school, led by the Holy Spirit, He took the book out of the hand of the master who was
teaching the law, and in the sight and hearing of all the people began to read, not indeed
what was written in their book; but He spoke in the Spirit of the living God, as if a stream
of water were gushing forth from a living fountain, and the fountain remained always full.
And with such power He taught the people the great things of the living God, that the
master himself fell to the ground and adored Him. And the heart of the people who sat and
heard Him saying such things was turned into astonishment. And when Joseph heard of
this, he came running to Jesus, fearing that the master himself was dead. And when the
master saw him, he said to him: Thou hast given me not a scholar, but a master; and who
can withstand his words? Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Psalmist: The
river of God is full of water: Thou hast prepared them corn, for so is the provision for it.1686</p>

<p>After these things Joseph departed thence with Mary and Jesus to go into Capernaum
by the sea-shore, on account of the malice of his adversaries. And when Jesus was living in
Capernaum, there was in the city a man named Joseph, exceedingly rich. But he had wasted
away under his infirmity, and died, and was lying dead in his couch. And when Jesus heard
them in the city mourning, and weeping, and lamenting over the dead man, He said to
Joseph: Why dost thou not afford the benefit of thy favour to this man, seeing that he is
called by thy name? And Joseph answered him: How have I any power or ability to afford
him a benefit? And Jesus said to him: Take the handkerchief which is upon thy head, and
go and put it on the face of the dead man, and say to him: Christ heal thee; and immediately
the dead man will be healed, and will rise from his couch. And when Joseph heard this, he
went away at the command of Jesus, and ran, and entered the house of the dead man, and
put the handkerchief which he was wearing on his head upon the face of him who was lying
in the couch, and said: Jesus heal thee. And forthwith the dead man rose from his bed, and
asked who Jesus was.1687</p>

vegetables for the purpose of making broth. And Jesus followed His brother James into the
garden; but Joseph and Mary did not know this. And while James was collecting the vegetables,
a viper suddenly came out of a hole and struck his hand,1689 and he began to cry out
from excessive pain. And, becoming exhausted, he said, with a bitter cry: Alas! alas! an
accursed viper has struck my hand. And Jesus, who was standing opposite to him, at the
bitter cry ran up to James, and took hold of his hand; and all that He did was to blow on the
hand of James, and cool it: and immediately James was healed, and the serpent died. And
Joseph and Mary did not know what had been done; but at the cry of James, and the command

<p>And Joseph having come to a feast with his sons, James, Joseph, and Judah, and Simeon
and his two daughters, Jesus met them, with Mary His mother, along with her sister Mary
of Cleophas, whom the Lord God had given to her father Cleophas and her mother Anna,
because they had offered Mary the mother of Jesus to the Lord. And she was called by the
same name, Mary, for the consolation of her parents.1690 And when they had come together,
Jesus sanctified and blessed them, and He was the first to begin to eat and drink; for none
of them dared to eat or drink, or to sit at table, or to break bread, until He had sanctified
them, and first done so. And if He happened to be absent, they used to wait until He should
do this. And when He did not wish to come for refreshment, neither Joseph nor Mary, nor
the sons of Joseph, His brothers, came. And, indeed, these brothers, keeping His life as a
lamp before their eyes, observed Him, and feared Him. And when Jesus slept, whether by
day or by night, the brightness of God shone upon Him. To whom be all praise and glory
for ever and ever. Amen, amen.</p>
<note type="footnote">1690 One of themss. has: And when Joseph, worn out with old age, died and was buried with his parents, the
blessed Mary lived with her nephews, or with the children of her sisters; for Anna and Emerina were sisters. Of
Emerina was born Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. And as Anna, the mother of the blessed Mary, was
very beautiful, when Joachim was dead she was married to Cleophas, by whom she had a second daughter. She
called her Mary, and gave her to Alphæus to wife; and of her was born James the son of Alphæus, and Philip
his brother. And her second husband having died, Anna was married to a third husband named Salome, by
whom she had a third daughter. She called her Mary likewise, and gave her to Zebedee to wife; and of her were
born James the son of Zebedee, and John the Evangelist. Another passage to the same effect is prefixed to the
Gospel. It reads Emeria for Emerina, and Joseph for Philip. It ends with a quotation from Jerome’s sermon
upon Easter:—We read in the Gospels that there were four Mary’s—first, the mother of the Lord the Saviour;
second, His maternal aunt, who was called Mary of Cleophas; third, Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
fourth, Mary Magdalene—though some maintain that the mother of James and Joseph was His aunt. The same
ms. thus concludes: The holy Apostle and Evangelist John with his own hand wrote this little book in Hebrew,
and the learned doctor Jerome rendered it from Hebrew into Latin.</note>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>The blessed and glorious ever-virgin Mary, sprung from the royal stock and family of
David, born in the city of Nazareth, was brought up at Jerusalem in the temple of the Lord.
Her father was named Joachim, and her mother Anna. Her father’s house was from Galilee
and the city of Nazareth, but her mother’s family from Bethlehem. Their life was guileless
and right before the Lord, and irreproachable and pious before men. For they divided all
their substance into three parts. One part they spent upon the temple and the temple servants;
another they distributed to strangers and the poor; the third they reserved, for themselves
and the necessities of their family. Thus, dear to God, kind to men, for about twenty years
they lived in their own house, a chaste married life, without having any children. Nevertheless
they vowed that, should the Lord happen to give them offspring, they would deliver it to
the service of the Lord; on which account also they used to visit the temple of the Lord at
each of the feasts during the year.</p>

<p>And it came to pass that the festival of the dedication1691 was at hand; wherefore also
Joachim went up to Jerusalem with some men of his own tribe. Now at that time Issachar1692
was high priest there. And when he saw Joachim with his offering among his other fellowcitizens,
he despised him, and spurned his gifts, asking why he, who had no offspring, presumed
to stand among those who had; saying that his gifts could not by any means be acceptable
to God, since He had deemed him unworthy of off-spring: for the Scripture said,
Cursed is every one who has not begot a male or a female in Israel.1693 He said, therefore,
that he ought first to be freed from this curse by the begetting of children; and then, and
then only, that he should come into the presence of the Lord with his offerings. And Joachim,
covered with shame from this reproach that was thrown in his teeth, retired to the shepherds,
who were in their pastures with their flocks; nor would he return home, lest perchance he
might be branded with the same reproach by those of his own tribe, who were there at the
time, and had heard this from the priest.</p>

<p>Now, when he had been there for some time, on a certain day when he was alone, an
angel of the Lord stood by him in a great light. And when he was disturbed at his appearance,
the angel who had appeared to him restrained his fear, saying: Fear not, Joachim, nor be
disturbed by my appearance; for I am the angel of the Lord, sent by Him to thee to tell thee
that thy prayers have been heard, and that thy charitable deeds have gone up into His presence.
1694 For He hath seen thy shame, and hath heard the reproach of unfruitfulness which
has been unjustly brought against thee. For God is the avenger of sin, not of nature: and,
therefore, when He shuts up the womb of any one, He does so that He may miraculously
open it again; so that that which is born may be acknowledged to be not of lust, but of the
gift of God. For was it not the case that the first mother of your nation—Sarah—was barren
up to her eightieth year?1695 And, nevertheless, in extreme old age she brought forth Isaac,
to whom the promise was renewed of the blessing of all nations. Rachel also, so favoured
of the Lord, and so beloved by holy Jacob, was long barren; and yet she brought forth Joseph,
who was not only the lord of Egypt, but the deliverer of many nations who were ready to
perish of hunger. Who among the judges was either stronger than Samson, or more holy
than Samuel? And yet the mothers of both were barren. If, therefore, the reasonableness
of my words does not persuade thee, believe in fact that conceptions very late in life, and
births in the case of women that have been barren, are usually attended with something
wonderful. Accordingly thy wife Anna will bring forth a daughter to thee, and thou shalt
call her name Mary: she shall be, as you have vowed, consecrated to the Lord from her in-
fancy, and she shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from her mother’s womb. She shall
neither eat nor drink any unclean thing, nor shall she spend her life among the crowds of
the people without, but in the temple of the Lord, that it may not be possible either to say,
or so much as to suspect, any evil concerning her. Therefore, when she has grown up, just
as she herself shall be miraculously born of a barren woman, so in an incomparable manner
she, a virgin, shall bring forth the Son of the Most High, who shall be called Jesus, and who,
according to the etymology of His name, shall be the Saviour of all nations. And this shall
be the sign to thee of those things which I announce: When thou shalt come to the Golden
gate in Jerusalem, thou shalt there meet Anna thy wife, who, lately anxious from the delay
of thy return, will then rejoice at the sight of thee. Having thus spoken, the angel departed
from him.</p>

of the favour of the Lord even from her birth, shall remain three years in her father’s house
until she be weaned. Thereafter, being delivered to the service of the Lord, she shall not
depart from the temple until she reach the years of discretion. There, in fine, serving God
day and night in fastings and prayers, she shall abstain from every unclean thing; she shall
never know man, but alone, without example, immaculate, uncorrupted, without intercourse
with man, she, a virgin, shall bring forth a son; she, His hand-maiden, shall bring forth the
Lord—both in grace, and in name, and in work, the Saviour of the world. Wherefore arise,
and go up to Jerusalem; and when thou shalt come to the gate which, because it is plated
with gold, is called Golden, there, for a sign, thou shalt meet thy husband, for whose safety
thou hast been anxious. And when these things shall have so happened, know that what I

in the certainty of the promised offspring, they gave the thanks due to the Lord, who exalteth

<p>And when the circle of three years had rolled round, and the time of her weaning was
fulfilled, they brought the virgin to the temple of the Lord with offerings. Now there were
round the temple, according to the fifteen Psalms of Degrees,1696 fifteen steps going up; for,
on account of the temple having been built on a mountain, the altar of burnt-offering, which
stood outside, could not be reached except by steps. On one of these, then, her parents
placed the little girl, the blessed virgin Mary. And when they were putting off the clothes
which they had worn on the journey, and were putting on, as was usual, others that were
neater and cleaner, the virgin of the Lord went up all the steps, one after the other, without
the help of any one leading her or lifting her, in such a manner that, in this respect at least,
you would think that she had already attained full age. For already the Lord in the infancy
of His virgin wrought a great thing, and by the indication of this miracle foreshowed how
great she was to be. Therefore, a sacrifice having been offered according to the custom of
the law, and their vow being perfected, they left the virgin within the enclosures of the
temple, there to be educated with the other virgins, and themselves returned home.</p>

<p>But the virgin of the Lord advanced in age and in virtues; and though, in the words of
the Psalmist, her father and mother had forsaken her, the Lord took her up.1697 For daily
was she visited by angels, daily did she enjoy a divine vision, which preserved her from all
evil, and made her to abound in all good. And so she reached her fourteenth year; and not
only were the wicked unable to charge her with anything worthy of reproach, but all the
good, who knew her life and conversation, judged her to be worthy of admiration. Then
the high priest publicly announced that the virgins who were publicly settled in the temple,
and had reached this time of life, should return home and get married, according to the
custom of the nation and the ripeness of their years. The others readily obeyed this command;
but Mary alone, the virgin of the Lord, answered that she could not do this, saying
both that her parents had devoted her to the service of the Lord, and that, moreover, she
herself had made to the Lord a vow of virginity, which she would never violate by any intercourse
with man. And the high priest, being placed in great perplexity of mind, seeing that
neither did he think that the vow should be broken contrary to the Scripture, which says,
Vow and pay,1698 nor did he dare to introduce a custom unknown to the nation, gave order
that at the festival, which was at hand, all the chief persons from Jerusalem and the neighbourhood
should be present, in order that from their advice he might know what was to be
done in so doubtful a case. And when this took place, they resolved unanimously that the
Lord should be consulted upon this matter. And when they all bowed themselves in prayer,
the high priest went to consult God in the usual way. Nor had they long to wait: in the
hearing of all a voice issued from the oracle and from the mercy-seat, that, according to the
prophecy of Isaiah, a man should be sought out to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted
and espoused. For it is clear that Isaiah says: A rod shall come forth from the root of Jesse,
and a flower shall ascend from his root; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of wisdom
and piety; and he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord.1699 According to this
prophecy, therefore, he predicted that all of the house and family of David that were unmarried
and fit for marriage should bring there rods to the altar; and that he whose rod after it
was brought should produce a flower, and upon the end of whose rod the Spirit of the Lord
should settle in the form of a dove, was the man to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted
and espoused.</p>

<p>Now there was among the rest Joseph, of the house and family of David, a man of great
age: and when all brought there rods, according to the order, he alone withheld his.
Wherefore, when nothing in conformity with the divine voice appeared, the high priest
thought it necessary to consult God a second time; and He answered, that of those who had
been designated, he alone to whom the virgin ought to be espoused had not brought his
rod. Joseph, therefore, was found out. For when he had brought his rod, and the dove came
from heaven; and settled upon the top of it, it clearly appeared to all that he was the man to
whom the virgin should be espoused. Therefore, the usual ceremonies of betrothal having
been gone through, he went back to the city of Bethlehem to put his house in order, and to
procure things necessary for the marriage. But Mary, the virgin of the Lord, with seven
other virgins of her own age, and who had been weaned at the same time, whom she had
received from the priest, returned to the house of her parents in Galilee.</p>

<p>And in those days, that is, at the time of her first coming into Galilee, the angel Gabriel
was sent to her by God, to announce to her the conception of the Lord, and to explain to
her the manner and order of the conception. Accordingly, going in, he filled the chamber
where she was with a great light; and most courteously saluting her, he said: Hail, Mary!
O virgin highly favoured by the Lord, virgin full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art
thou above all women, blessed above all men that have been hitherto born.1700 And the
virgin, who was already well acquainted with angelic faces, and was not unused to the light
from heaven, was neither terrified by the vision of the angel, nor astonished at the greatness
of the light, but only perplexed by his words; and she began to consider of what nature a
salutation so unusual could be, or what it could portend, or what end it could have. And
the angel, divinely inspired, taking up this thought, says: Fear not, Mary, as if anything
contrary to thy chastity were hid under this salutation. For in choosing chastity, thou hast
found favour with the Lord; and therefore thou, a virgin, shalt conceive without sin, and
shalt bring forth a son. He shall be great, because He shall rule from sea to sea, and from
the river even to the ends of the earth;1701 and He shall be called the Son of the Most High,
because He who is born on earth in humiliation, reigns in heaven in exaltation; and the
Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign in the house of
Jacob for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end;1702 forasmuch as He is King of
kings and Lord of lords,1703 and His throne is from everlasting to everlasting. The virgin
did not doubt these words of the angel; but wishing to know the manner of it, she answered:
How can that come to pass? For while, according to my vow, I never know man, how can
I bring forth without the addition of man’s seed? To this the angel says: Think not, Mary,
that thou shalt conceive in the manner of mankind: for without any intercourse with man,
thou, a virgin, wilt conceive; thou, a virgin, wilt bring forth; thou, a virgin, wilt nurse: for
the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow
thee,1704 without any of the heats of lust; and therefore that which shall be born of thee shall
alone be holy, because it alone, being conceived and born without sin, shall be called the
Son of God. Then Mary stretched forth her hands, and raised her eyes to heaven, and said:
Behold the hand-maiden of the Lord, for I am not worthy of the name of lady; let it be to
me according to thy word.</p>

<p>Joseph therefore came from Judæa into Galilee, intending to marry the virgin who had
been betrothed to him; for already three months had elapsed, and it was the beginning of
the fourth since she had been betrothed to him. In the meantime, it was evident from her
shape that she was pregnant, nor could she conceal this from Joseph. For in consequence
of his being betrothed to her, coming to her more freely and speaking to her more familiarly,
he found out that she was with child. He began then to be in great doubt and perplexity,
because he did not know what was best for him to do. For, being a just man, he was not
willing to expose her; nor, being a pious man, to injure her fair fame by a suspicion of fornication.
He came to the conclusion, therefore, privately to dissolve their contract, and to
send her away secretly. And while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, thou son of David, fear not; that is, do not have
any suspicion of fornication in the virgin, or think any evil of her; and fear not to take her
as thy wife: for that which is begotten in her, and which now vexes thy soul, is the work not
of man, but of the Holy Spirit. For she alone of all virgins shall bring forth the Son of God,
and thou shalt call His name Jesus, that is, Saviour; for He shall save His people from their
sins. Therefore Joseph, according to the command of the angel, took the virgin as his wife;
nevertheless he knew her not, but took care of her, and kept her in chastity.1705 And now
the ninth month from her conception was at hand, when Joseph, taking with him his wife
along with what things he needed, went to Bethlehem, the city from which he came. And
it came to pass, while they were there, that her days were fulfilled that she should bring forth;
and she brought forth her first-born son, as the holy evangelists have shown, our Lord Jesus
Christ, who with the Father and the Son1706 and the Holy Ghost lives and reigns God from
everlasting to everlasting.</p>

<head>The History of Joseph the Carpenter.</head>
<p>In the name of God, of one essence and three persons.</p>
<p>The History of the death of our father, the holy old man, Joseph the carpenter.</p>
<p>May his blessings and prayers preserve us all, O brethren! Amen.</p>
<p>His whole life was one hundred and eleven years, and his departure from this world
happened on the twenty-sixth of the month Abib, which answers to the month Ab. May
his prayer preserve us! Amen. And, indeed, it was our Lord Jesus Christ Himself who related
this history to His holy disciples on the Mount of Olives, and all Joseph’s labour, and the
end of his days. And the holy apostles have preserved this conversation, and have left it
written down in the library at Jerusalem. May their prayers preserve us! Amen.1707</p>
<p>1. It happened one day, when the Saviour, our Master, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ,
was sitting along with His disciples, and they were all assembled on the Mount of Olives,
that He said to them: O my brethren and friends, sons of the Father who has chosen you
from all men, you know that I have often told you that I must be crucified, and must die for
the salvation of Adam and his posterity, and that I shall rise from the dead. Now I shall
commit to you the doctrine of the holy gospel formerly announced to you, that you may
declare it throughout the whole world. And I shall endow you with power from on high,
and fill you with the Holy Spirit.1708 And you shall declare to all nations repentance and
remission of sins.1709 For a single cup of water,1710 if a man shall find it in the world to
come, is greater and better than all the wealth of this whole world. And as much ground as
one foot can occupy in the house of my Father, is greater and more excellent than all the
riches of the earth. Yea, a single hour in the joyful dwelling of the pious is more blessed and
more precious than a thousand years among sinners:1711 inasmuch as their weeping and
lamentation shall not come to an end, and their tears shall not cease, nor shall they find for
themselves consolation and repose at any time for ever. And now, O my honoured members,
<note type="footnote">1707 The Coptic has: The 26th day of Epep. This is the departure from the body of our father Joseph the
carpenter, the father of Christ after the flesh, who was 111 years old. Our Saviour narrated all his life to His
apostles on Mount Olivet; and His apostles wrote it, and put it in the library which is in Jerusalem. Also that
the day on which the holy old man laid down his body was the 26th of the month Epep. In the peace of God,
amen. His day is the 19th of March in the Roman calendar.</note>

go declare to all nations, tell them, and say to them: Verily the Saviour diligently inquires
into the inheritance which is due, and is the administrator of justice. And the angels will
cast down their enemies, and will fight for them in the day of conflict. And He will examine
every single foolish and idle word which men speak, and they shall give an account of it.1712
For as no one shall escape death, so also the works of every man shall be laid open on the
day of judgment, whether they have been good or evil.1713 Tell them also this word which
I have said to you to-day: Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the rich man in
his riches; but let him who wishes to glory, glory in the Lord.1714</p>
<p>2. There was a man whose name was Joseph, sprung from a family of Bethlehem, a
town of Judah, and the city of King David. This same man, being well furnished with wisdom
and learning, was made a priest in the temple of the Lord. He was, besides, skilful in his
trade, which was that of a carpenter; and after the manner of all men, he married a wife.
Moreover, he begot for himself sons and daughters, four sons, namely, and two daughters.
Now these are their names—Judas, Justus, James, and Simon. The names of the two
daughters were Assia and Lydia. At length the wife of righteous Joseph, a woman intent on
the divine glory in all her works, departed this life. But Joseph, that righteous man, my
father after the flesh, and the spouse of my mother Mary, went away with his sons to his
trade, practising the art of a carpenter.</p>
<p>3. Now when righteous Joseph became a widower, my mother Mary, blessed, holy, and
pure, was already twelve years old. For her parents offered her in the temple when she was
three years of age, and she remained in the temple of the Lord nine years. Then when the
priests saw that the virgin, holy and God-fearing, was growing up, they spoke to each other,
saying: Let us search out a man, righteous and pious, to whom Mary may be entrusted until
the time of her marriage; lest, if she remain in the temple, it happen to her as is wont to
happen to women, and lest on that account we sin, and God be angry with us.</p>
<p>4. Therefore they immediately sent out, and assembled twelve old men of the tribe of
Judah. And they wrote down the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. And the lot fell upon
the pious old man, righteous Joseph. Then the priests answered, and said to my blessed
mother: Go with Joseph, and be with him till the time of your marriage. Righteous Joseph
therefore received my mother, and led her away to his own house. And Mary found James
the Less in his father’s house, broken-hearted and sad on account of the loss of his mother,
and she brought him up. Hence Mary was called the mother of James.1715 Thereafter Joseph
left her at home, and went away to the shop where he wrought at his trade of a carpenter.

And after the holy virgin had spent two years in his house her age was exactly fourteen years,
including the time at which he received her.</p>
<p>5. And I chose her of my own will, with the concurrence of my Father, and the counsel
of the Holy Spirit. And I was made flesh of her, by a mystery which transcends the grasp
of created reason. And three months after her conception the righteous man Joseph returned
from the place where he worked at his trade; and when he found my virgin mother pregnant,
he was greatly perplexed, and thought of sending her away secretly.1716 But from fear, and
sorrow, and the anguish of his heart, he could endure neither to eat nor drink that day.</p>
<p>6. But at mid-day there appeared to him in a dream the prince of the angels, the holy
Gabriel, furnished with a command from my Father; and he said to him: Joseph, son of
David, fear not to take Mary as thy wife: for she has conceived of the Holy Spirit; and she
will bring forth a son, whose name shall be called Jesus. He it is who shall rule all nations
with a rod of iron.1717 Having thus spoken, the angel departed from him. And Joseph rose
from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had said to him; and Mary abode with
him.1718</p>
<p>7. Some time after that, there came forth an order from Augustus Cæsar the king, that
all the habitable world should be enrolled, each man in his own city. The old man therefore,
righteous Joseph, rose up and took the virgin Mary and came to Bethlehem, because the
time of her bringing forth was at hand. Joseph then inscribed his name in the list; for Joseph
the son of David, whose spouse Mary was, was of the tribe of Judah. And indeed Mary, my
mother, brought me forth in Bethlehem, in a cave near the tomb of Rachel the wife of the
patriarch Jacob, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin.</p>
<p>8. But Satan went and told this to Herod the Great, the father of Archelaus. And it was
this same Herod1719 who ordered my friend and relative John to be beheaded. Accordingly
he searched for me diligently, thinking that my kingdom was to be of this world.1720 But
Joseph, that pious old man, was warned of this by a dream. Therefore he rose and took
Mary my mother, and I lay in her bosom. Salome1721 also was their fellow-traveller. Having
therefore set out from home, he retired into Egypt, and remained there the space of one
whole year, until the hatred of Herod passed away.</p>

<p>9. Now Herod died by the worst form of death, atoning for the shedding of the blood
of the children whom he wickedly cut off, though there was no sin in them. And that impious
tyrant Herod being dead, they returned into the land of Israel, and lived in a city of Galilee
which is called Nazareth. And Joseph, going back to his trade of a carpenter, earned his
living by the work of his hands; for, as the law of Moses had commanded, he never sought
to live for nothing by another’s labour.1722</p>
<p>10. At length, by increasing years, the old man arrived at a very advanced age. He did
not, however, labour under any bodily weakness, nor had his sight failed, nor had any tooth
perished from his mouth. In mind also, for the whole time of his life, he never wandered;
but like a boy he always in his business displayed youthful vigour, and his limbs remained
unimpaired, and free from all pain. His life, then, in all, amounted to one hundred and eleven
years, his old age being prolonged to the utmost limit.</p>
<p>11. Now Justus and Simeon, the elder sons of Joseph, were married, and had families
of their own. Both the daughters were likewise married, and lived in their own houses. So
there remained in Joseph’s house, Judas and James the Less, and my virgin mother. I
moreover dwelt along with them, not otherwise than if I had been one of his sons. But I
passed all my life without fault. Mary I called my mother, and Joseph father, and I obeyed
them in all that they said; nor did I ever contend against them, but complied with their
commands, as other men whom earth produces are wont to do; nor did I at any time arouse
their anger, or give any word or answer in opposition to them. On the contrary, I cherished
them with great love, like the pupil of my eye.</p>
<p>12. It came to pass, after these things, that the death of that old man, the pious Joseph,
and his departure from this world, were approaching, as happens to other men who owe
their origin to this earth. And as his body was verging on dissolution, an angel of the Lord
informed him that his death was now close at hand. Therefore fear and great perplexity
came upon him. So he rose up and went to Jerusalem; and going into the temple of the
Lord, he poured out his prayers there before the sanctuary, and said:</p>
<p>13. O God! author of all consolation, God of all compassion, and Lord of the whole
human race; God of my soul, body, and spirit; with supplications I reverence thee, O Lord
and my God. If now my days are ended, and the time draws near when I must leave this
world, send me, I beseech Thee, the great Michael, the prince of Thy holy angels: let him
remain with me, that my wretched soul may depart from this afflicted body without trouble,
without terror and impatience. For great fear and intense sadness take hold of all bodies
on the day of their death, whether it be man or woman, beast wild or tame, or whatever
creeps on the ground or flies in the air. At the last all creatures under heaven in whom is
the breath of life are struck with horror, and their souls depart from their bodies with strong
<note type="footnote">1722 Gen. iii. 19.</note>

<pb n="1312"/>
fear and great depression. Now therefore, O Lord and my God, let Thy holy angel be present
with his help to my soul and body, until they shall be dissevered from each other. And let
not the face of the angel, appointed my guardian from the day of my birth,1723 be turned
away from me; but may he be the companion of my journey even until he bring me to Thee:
let his countenance be pleasant and gladsome to me, and let him accompany me in peace.
And let not demons of frightful aspect come near me in the way in which I am to go, until
I come to Thee in bliss. And let not the doorkeepers hinder my soul from entering paradise.
And do not uncover my sins, and expose me to condemnation before Thy terrible tribunal.
Let not the lions rush in upon me; nor let the waves of the sea of fire overwhelm my soul—for
this must every soul pass through1724—before I have seen the glory of Thy Godhead. O
God, most righteous Judge, who in justice and equity wilt judge mankind, and wilt render
unto each one according to his works, O Lord and my God, I beseech Thee, be present to
me in Thy compassion, and enlighten my path that I may come to Thee; for Thou art a
fountain overflowing with all good things, and with glory for evermore. Amen.</p>
<p>14. It came to pass thereafter, when he returned to his own house in the city of Nazareth,
that he was seized by disease, and had to keep his bed. And it was at this time that he died,
according to the destiny of all mankind. For this disease was very heavy upon him, and he
had never been ill, as he now was, from the day of his birth. And thus assuredly it pleased
Christ1725 to order the destiny of righteous Joseph. He lived forty years unmarried; thereafter
his wife remained under his care forty-nine years, and then died. And a year after her death,
my mother, the blessed Mary, was entrusted to him by the priests, that he should keep her
until the time of her marriage. She spent two years in his house; and in the third year of her
stay with Joseph, in the fifteenth year of her age, she brought me forth on earth by a mystery
which no creature can penetrate or understand, except myself, and my Father and the Holy
Spirit, constituting one essence with myself.1726</p>

by the priests to take charge of her until the time of her marriage. And my mother Mary brought me forth in
the third year that she was in Joseph’s house, in the fifteenth year of her age. My mother bore me in a cave (this
seems a mistranslation for mystery), which it is unlawful either to name or seek, and there is not in the whole

<p>15. The whole age of my father, therefore, that righteous old man, was one hundred
and eleven years, my Father in heaven having so decreed. And the day on which his soul
left his body was the twenty-sixth of the month Abib. For now the fine gold began to lose
its splendour, and the silver to be worn down by use—I mean his understanding and his
wisdom. He also loathed food and drink, and lost all his skill in his trade of carpentry, nor
did he any more pay attention to it. It came to pass, then, in the early dawn of the twentysixth
day of Abib, that Joseph, that righteous old man, lying in his bed, was giving up his
unquiet soul. Wherefore he opened his mouth with many sighs, and struck his hands one
against the other, and with a loud voice cried out, and spoke after the following manner:—</p>
<p>16. Woe to the day on which I was born into the world! Woe to the womb which bare
me! Woe to the bowels which admitted me! Woe to the breasts which suckled me! Woe
to the feet upon which I sat and rested! Woe to the hands which carried me and reared me
until I grew up!1727 For I was conceived in iniquity, and in sins did my mother desire
me.1728 Woe to my tongue and my lips, which have brought forth and spoken vanity, detraction,
falsehood, ignorance, derision, idle tales, craft, and hypocrisy! Woe to mine eyes,
which have looked upon scandalous things! Woe to mine ears, which have delighted in the
words of slanderers! Woe to my hands, which have seized what did not of right belong to
them! Woe to my belly and my bowels, which have lusted after food unlawful to be eaten!
Woe to my throat, which like a fire has consumed all that it found! Woe to my feet, which
have too often walked in ways displeasing to God! Woe to my body; and woe to my miserable
soul, which has already turned aside from God its Maker! What shall I do when I arrive at
that place where I must stand before the most righteous Judge, and when He shall call me
to account for the works which I have heaped up in my youth? Woe to every man dying in
his sins! Assuredly that same dreadful hour, which came upon my father Jacob,1729 when
his soul was flying forth from his body, is now, behold, near at hand for me. Oh! how
wretched I am this day, and worthy of lamentation! But God alone is the disposer of my
soul and body; He also will deal with them after His own good pleasure.</p>
<p>17. These are the words spoken by Joseph, that righteous old man. And I, going in
beside him, found his soul exceedingly troubled, for he was placed in great perplexity. And
I said to him: Hail! my father Joseph, thou righteous man; how is it with thee? And he
answered me: All hail! my well-beloved son. Indeed, the agony and fear of death have
already environed me; but as soon as I heard Thy voice, my soul was at rest. O Jesus of

Nazareth! Jesus, my Saviour! Jesus, the deliverer of my soul! Jesus, my protector! Jesus!
O sweetest name in my mouth, and in the mouth of all those that love it! O eye which seest,
and ear which hearest, hear me! I am Thy servant; this day I most humbly reverence Thee,
and before Thy face I pour out my tears. Thou art altogether my God; Thou art my Lord,
as the angel has told me times without number, and especially on that day when my soul
was driven about with perverse thoughts about the pure and blessed Mary, who was carrying
Thee in her womb, and whom I was thinking of secretly sending away. And while I was
thus meditating, behold, there appeared to me in my rest angels of the Lord, saying to me
in a wonderful mystery: O Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take Mary as thy wife; and
do not grieve thy soul, nor speak unbecoming words of her conception, because she is with
child of the Holy Spirit, and shall bring forth a son, whose name shall be called Jesus, for
He shall save His people from their sins. Do not for this cause wish me evil, O Lord! for I
was ignorant of the mystery of Thy birth. I call to mind also, my Lord, that day when the
boy died of the bite of the serpent. And his relations wished to deliver Thee to Herod, saying
that Thou hadst killed him; but Thou didst raise him from the dead, and restore him to
them. Then I went up to Thee, and took hold of Thy hand, saying: My son, take care of
thyself. But Thou didst say to me in reply: Art thou not my father after the flesh? I shall
teach thee who I am.1730 Now therefore, O Lord and my God, do not be angry with me, or
condemn me on account of that hour. I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaiden;
1731 but Thou art my Lord, my God and Saviour, most surely the Son of God.</p>
<p>18. When my father Joseph had thus spoken, he was unable to weep more. And I saw
that death now had dominion over him. And my mother, virgin undefiled, rose and came
to me, saying: O my beloved son, this pious old man Joseph is now dying. And I answered:
Oh my dearest mother, assuredly upon all creatures produced in this world the same necessity
of death lies; for death holds sway over the whole human race. Even thou, O my virgin
mother, must look for the same end of life as other mortals. And yet thy death, as also the
death of this pious man, is not death, but life enduring to eternity. Nay more, even I must
die, as concerns the body which I have received from thee. But rise, O my venerable
mother, and go in to Joseph, that blessed old man, in order that thou mayst see what will
happen as his soul ascends from his body.</p>
<p>19. My undefiled mother Mary, therefore, went and entered the place where Joseph
was. And I was sitting at his feet looking at him, for the signs of death already appeared in
his countenance. And that blessed old man raised his head, and kept his eyes fixed on my

face; but he had no power of speaking to me, on account of the agonies of death, which held
him in their grasp. But he kept fetching many sighs. And I held his hands for a whole hour;
and he turned his face to me, and made signs for me not to leave him. Thereafter I put my
hand upon his breast, and perceived his soul now near his throat, preparing to depart from
its receptacle.</p>
<p>20. And when my virgin mother saw me touching his body, she also touched his feet.
And finding them already dead and destitute of heat, she said to me: O my beloved son,
assuredly his feet are already beginning to stiffen, and they are as cold as snow. Accordingly
she summoned his sons and daughters, and said to them: Come, as many as there are of
you, and go to your father; for assuredly he is now at the very point of death. And Assia,
his daughter, answered and said: Woe’s me, O my brothers, this is certainly the same disease
that my beloved mother died of. And she lamented and shed tears; and all Joseph’s other
children mourned along with her. I also, and my mother Mary, wept along with them.1732</p>
<p>21. And turning my eyes towards the region of the south, I saw Death already approaching,
and all Gehenna with him, closely attended by his army and his satellites; and their
clothes, their faces, and their mouths poured forth flames. And when my father Joseph saw
them coming straight to him, his eyes dissolved in tears, and at the same time he groaned
after a strange manner. Accordingly, when I saw the vehemence of his sighs, I drove back
Death and all the host of servants which accompanied him. And I called upon my good
Father, saying:—</p>
<p>22. O Father of all mercy, eye which seest, and ear which hearest, hearken to my prayers
and supplications in behalf of the old man Joseph; and send Michael, the prince of Thine
angels, and Gabriel, the herald of light, and all the light of Thine angels, and let their whole
array walk with the soul of my father Joseph, until they shall have conducted it to Thee.
This is the hour in which my father has need of compassion. And I say unto you, that all
the saints, yea, as many men as are born in the world, whether they be just or whether they
be perverse, must of necessity taste of death.</p>
<p>23. Therefore Michael and Gabriel came to the soul of my father Joseph, and took it,
and wrapped it in a shining wrapper. Thus he committed his spirit into the hands of my
good Father, and He bestowed upon him peace. But as yet none of his children knew that
he had fallen asleep. And the angels preserved his soul from the demons of darkness which
were in the way, and praised God even until they conducted it into the dwelling-place of
the pious.</p>
<p>24. Now his body was lying prostrate and bloodless; wherefore I reached forth my hand,
and put right his eyes and shut his mouth, and said to the virgin Mary: O my mother, where

<pb n="1316"/>
is the skill which he showed in all the time that he lived in this world? Lo! it has perished,
as if it had never existed. And when his children heard me speaking with my mother, the
pure virgin, they knew that he had already breathed his last, and they shed tears, and
lamented. But I said to them: Assuredly the death of your father is not death, but life
everlasting: for he has been freed from the troubles of this life, and has passed to perpetual
and everlasting rest. When they heard these words, they rent their clothes, and wept.</p>
<p>25. And, indeed, the inhabitants of Nazareth and of Galilee, having heard of their
lamentation, flocked to them, and wept from the third hour even to the ninth. And at the
ninth hour they all went together to Joseph’s bed. And they lifted his body, after they had
anointed it with costly unguents. But I entreated my Father in the prayer of the celestials—
that same prayer which with my own hand I made before I was carried in the womb
of the virgin Mary, my mother. And as soon as I had finished it, and pronounced the amen,
a great multitude of angels came up; and I ordered two of them to stretch out their shining
garments, and to wrap in them the body of Joseph, the blessed old man.</p>
<p>26. And I spoke to Joseph, and said: The smell or corruption of death shall not have
dominion over thee, nor shall a worm ever come forth from thy body. Not a single limb of
it shall be broken, nor shall any hair on thy head be changed. Nothing of thy body shall
perish, O my father Joseph, but it will remain entire and uncorrupted even until the banquet
of the thousand years.1733 And whosoever shall make an offering on the day of thy remembrance,
him will I bless and recompense in the congregation of the virgins; and whosoever
shall give food to the wretched, the poor, the widows, and orphans from the work of his
hands, on the day on which thy memory shall be celebrated, and in thy name, shall not be
in want of good things all the days of his life. And whosoever shall have given a cup of water,
or of wine, to drink to the widow or orphan in thy name, I will give him to thee, that thou
mayst go in with him to the banquet of the thousand years. And every man who shall present
an offering on the day of thy commemoration will I bless and recompense in the church of
the virgins: for one I will render unto him thirty, sixty, and a hundred. And whosoever
shall write the history of thy life, of thy labour, and thy departure from this world, and this
narrative that has issued from my mouth, him shall I commit to thy keeping as long as he
shall have to do with this life. And when his soul departs from the body, and when he must
leave this world, I will burn the book of his sins, nor will I torment him with any punishment
in the day of judgment; but he shall cross the sea of flames, and shall go through it without

trouble or pain.1734 And upon every poor man who can give none of those things which I
have mentioned this is incumbent: viz., if a son is born to him, he shall call his name Joseph.
So there shall not take place in that house either poverty or any sudden death for ever.</p>
<p>27. Thereafter the chief men of the city came together to the place where the body of
the blessed old man Joseph had been laid, bringing with them burial-clothes; and they wished
to wrap it up in them after the manner in which the Jews are wont to arrange their dead
bodies. And they perceived that he kept his shroud fast; for it adhered to the body in such
a way, that when they wished to take it off, it was found to be like iron—impossible to be
moved or loosened. Nor could they find any ends in that piece of linen, which struck them
with the greatest astonishment. At length they carried him out to a place where there was
a cave, and opened the gate, that they might bury his body beside the bodies of his fathers.
Then there came into my mind the day on which he walked with me into Egypt, and that
extreme trouble which he endured on my account. Accordingly, I bewailed his death for a
long time; and lying upon his body, I said:—</p>
<p>28. O Death! who makest all knowledge to vanish away, and raisest so many tears and
lamentations, surely it is God my Father Himself who hath granted thee this power. For
men die for the transgression of Adam and his wife Eve, and Death spares not so much as
one. Nevertheless, nothing happens to any one, or is brought upon him, without the command
of my Father. There have certainly been men who have prolonged their life even to
nine hundred years; but they died. Yea, though some of them have lived longer, they have,
notwithstanding, succumbed to the same fate; nor has any one of them ever said: I have
not tasted death. For the Lord never sends the same punishment more than once, since it
hath pleased my Father to bring it upon men. And at the very moment when it, going forth,
beholds the command descending to it from heaven, it says: I will go forth against that man,
and will greatly move him. Then, without delay, it makes an onset on the soul, and obtains
the mastery of it, doing with it whatever it will. For, because Adam did not the will of my
Father, but transgressed His commandment, the wrath of my Father was kindled against
him, and He doomed him to death; and thus it was that death came into the world. But if
Adam had observed my Father’s precepts, death would never have fallen to his lot. Think
you that I can ask my good Father to send me a chariot of fire,1735 which may take up the
body of my father Joseph, and convey it to the place of rest, in order that it may dwell with
the spirits? But on account of the transgression of Adam, that trouble and violence of death

has descended upon all the human race. And it is for this cause that I must die according
to the flesh, for my work which I have created, that they may obtain grace.</p>
<p>29. Having thus spoken, I embraced the body of my father Joseph, and wept over it;
and they opened the door of the tomb, and placed his body in it, near the body of his father
Jacob. And at the time when he fell asleep he had fulfilled a hundred and eleven years.
Never did a tooth in his mouth hurt him, nor was his eyesight rendered less sharp, nor his
body bent, nor his strength impaired; but he worked at his trade of a carpenter to the very
last day of his life; and that was the six-and-twentieth of the month Abib.</p>
<p>30. And we apostles, when we heard these things from our Saviour, rose up joyfully,
and prostrated ourselves in honour of Him, and said: O our Saviour, show us Thy grace.
Now indeed we have heard the word of life: nevertheless we wonder, O our Saviour, at the
fate of Enoch and Elias, inasmuch as they had not to undergo death. For truly they dwell
in the habitation of the righteous even to the present day, nor have their bodies seen corruption.
Yet that old man Joseph the carpenter was, nevertheless, Thy father after the flesh.
And Thou hast ordered us to go into all the world and preach the holy Gospel; and Thou
hast said: Relate to them the death of my father Joseph, and celebrate to him with annual
solemnity a festival and sacred day. And whosoever shall take anything away from this
narrative, or add anything to it, commits sin.1736 We wonder especially that Joseph, even
from that day on which Thou wast born in Bethlehem, called Thee his son after the flesh.
Wherefore, then, didst Thou not make him immortal as well as them, and Thou sayest that
he was righteous and chosen?</p>
<p>31. And our Saviour answered and said: Indeed, the prophecy of my Father upon
Adam, for his disobedience, has now been fulfilled. And all things are arranged according
to the will and pleasure of my Father. For if a man rejects the commandment of God, and
follows the works of the devil by committing sin, his life is prolonged; for he is preserved
in order that he may perhaps repent, and reflect that he must be delivered into the hands
of death. But if any one has been zealous of good works, his life also is prolonged, that, as
the fame of his old age increases, upright men may imitate him. But when you see a man
whose mind is prone to anger, assuredly his days are shortened; for it is these that are taken
away in the flower of their age. Every prophecy, therefore, which my Father has pronounced
concerning the sons of men, must be fulfilled in every particular. But with reference to
Enoch and Elias, and how they remain alive to this day, keeping the same bodies with which
they were born; and as to what concerns my father Joseph, who has not been allowed as well
as they to remain in the body: indeed, though a man live in the world many myriads of
years, nevertheless at some time or other he is compelled to exchange life for death. And I
say to you, O my brethren, that they also, Enoch and Elias,1737 must towards the end of

time return into the world and die—in the day, namely, of commotion, of terror, of perplexity,
and affliction. For Antichrist will slay four bodies, and will pour out their blood like water,
because of the reproach to which they shall expose him, and the ignominy with which they,
in their lifetime, shall brand him when they reveal his impiety.</p>
<p>32. And we said: O our Lord, our God and Saviour, who are those four whom Thou
hast said Antichrist will cut off from the reproach they bring upon him? The Lord answered:
They are Enoch, Elias, Schila, and Tabitha.1738 When we heard this from our Saviour, we
rejoiced and exulted; and we offered all glory and thanksgiving to the Lord God, and our
Saviour Jesus Christ. He it is to whom is due glory, honour, dignity, dominion, power, and
praise, as well as to the good Father with Him, and to the Holy Spirit that giveth life,
henceforth and in all time for evermore. Amen.</p>

<head>Thomas the Israelite Philosopher’s Account of the Infancy of the Lord.</head>
<p>1. I Thomas, an Israelite, write you this account, that all the brethren from among the
heathen may know the miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ in His infancy, which He did after
His birth in our country. The beginning of it is as follows:—</p>
<p>2. This child Jesus, when five years old, was playing in the ford of a mountain stream;
and He collected the flowing waters into pools, and made them clear immediately, and by
a word alone He made them obey Him. And having made some soft clay, He fashioned out
of it twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when He did these things. And there were
also many other children playing with Him. And a certain Jew, seeing what Jesus was doing,
playing on the Sabbath, went off immediately, and said to his father Joseph: Behold, thy
son is at the stream, and has taken clay, and made of it twelve birds, and has profaned the
Sabbath. And Joseph, coming to the place and seeing, cried out to Him, saying: Wherefore
doest thou on the Sabbath what it is not lawful to do? And Jesus clapped His hands, and
cried out to the sparrows, and said to them: Off you go! And the sparrows flew, and went
off crying. And the Jews seeing this were amazed, and went away and reported to their chief
men what they had seen Jesus doing.1739</p>
<p>3. And the son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Joseph; and he took a willow
branch, and let out the waters which Jesus had collected. And Jesus, seeing what was done,
was angry, and said to him: O wicked, impious, and foolish! what harm did the pools and
the waters do to thee? Behold, even now thou shalt be dried up like a tree, and thou shalt
not bring forth either leaves, or root,1740 or fruit. And straightway that boy was quite dried
up. And Jesus departed, and went to Joseph’s house. But the parents of the boy that had
been dried up took him up, bewailing his youth, and brought him to Joseph, and reproached
him because, said they, thou hast such a child doing such things.1741</p>
<p>4. After that He was again passing through the village; and a boy ran up against Him,
and struck His shoulder. And Jesus was angry, and said to him: Thou shalt not go back the
way thou camest. And immediately he fell down dead. And some who saw what had taken

<pb n="1321"/>
place, said: Whence was this child begotten, that every word of his is certainly accomplished?
And the parents of the dead boy went away to Joseph, and blamed him, saying: Since thou
hast such a child, it is impossible for thee to live with us in the village; or else teach him to
bless, and not to curse:1742 for he is killing our children.</p>
<p>5. And Joseph called the child apart, and admonished Him, saying: Why doest thou
such things, and these people suffer, and hate us, and persecute us? And Jesus said: I know
that these words of thine are not thine own;1743 nevertheless for thy sake I will be silent; but
they shall bear their punishment. And straightway those that accused Him were struck
blind. And those who saw it were much afraid and in great perplexity, and said about Him:
Every word which he spoke, whether good or bad, was an act, and became a wonder. And
when they saw that Jesus had done such a thing, Joseph rose and took hold of His ear, and
pulled it hard. And the child was very angry, and said to him: It is enough for thee to seek,
and not to find; and most certainly thou hast not done wisely. Knowest thou not that I am
thine? Do not trouble me.1744</p>
<p>6. And a certain teacher, Zacchæus by name, was standing in a certain place, and heard
Jesus thus speaking to his father; and he wondered exceedingly, that, being a child, he should
speak in such a way. And a few days thereafter he came to Joseph, and said to him: Thou
hast a sensible child, and he has some mind. Give him to me, then, that he may learn letters;
and I shall teach him along with the letters all knowledge, both how to address all the elders,
and to honour them as forefathers and fathers, and how to love those of his own age. And
He said to him all the letters from the Alpha even to the Omega, clearly and with great exactness.
And He looked upon the teacher Zacchæus, and said to him: Thou who art ignorant
of the nature of the Alpha, how canst thou teach others the Beta? Thou hypocrite! first, if
thou knowest, teach the A, and then we shall believe thee about the B. Then He began to
question the teacher about the first letter, and he was not able to answer Him. And in the
hearing of many, the child says to Zacchæus: Hear, O teacher, the order of the first letter,
and notice here how it has lines, and a middle stroke crossing those which thou seest common;
(lines) brought together; the highest part supporting them, and again bringing them
under one head; with three points of intersection; of the same kind; principal and subordinate;
of equal length. Thou hast the lines of the A.1745</p>
<note type="footnote">1742 Or, either teach him to bless, and not to curse, or depart with him from this place; for, etc.</note>

<note type="footnote">1744 Pseudo-Matt. 29. <del>The numerous references to the latter part of Pseudo-Matthæi, see pp. 378–383,
shows the close relationship. But it is generally agreed that this narrative is the older, and one of the sources of
Pseudo-Matthæi.—R.</del></note>
<note type="footnote">1745 Pseud.-Matt. 30, 31. Various explanations have been given of this difficult passage by annotators, who
refer it to the A of the Hebrew, or of the Greek, or of the Armenian alphabet. It seems, however, to answer very
closely to the old Phenician A, which was written ***or***. The Paris ms. has: And he sat down to teach Jesus</note>

<pb n="1322"/>
<p>7. And when the teacher Zacchæus heard the child speaking such and so great allegories
of the first letter, he was at a great loss about such a narrative, and about His teaching. And
He said to those that were present: Alas! I, wretch that I am, am at a loss, bringing shame
upon myself by having dragged this child hither. Take him away, then, I beseech thee,
brother Joseph. I cannot endure the sternness of his look; I cannot make out his meaning
at all. That child does not belong to this earth; he can tame even fire. Assuredly he was
born before the creation of the world. What sort of a belly bore him, what sort of a womb
nourished him, I do not know. Alas! my friend, he has carried me away; I cannot get at his
meaning: thrice wretched that I am, I have deceived myself. I made a struggle to have a
scholar, and I was found to have a teacher. My mind is filled with shame, my friends, because
I, an old man, have been conquered by a child. There is nothing for me but despondency
and death on account of this boy, for I am not able at this hour to look him in the face; and
when everybody says that I have been beaten by a little child, what can I say? And how can
I give an account of the lines of the first letter that he spoke about? I know not, O my friends;
for I can make neither beginning nor end of him. Therefore, I beseech thee, brother Joseph,
take him home. What great thing he is, either god or angel, or what I am to say, I know
not.1746</p>
<p>8. And when the Jews were encouraging Zacchæus, the child laughed aloud, and said:
Now let thy learning bring forth fruit, and let the blind in heart see. I am here from above,
that I may curse them, and call them to the things that are above, as He that sent me on your
account has commanded me. And when the child ceased speaking, immediately all were
made whole who had fallen under His curse. And no one after that dared to make Him
angry, lest He should curse him, and he should be maimed.</p>
<p>9. And some days after, Jesus was playing in an upper room of a certain house, and one
of the children that were playing with Him fell down from the house, and was killed. And,
when the other children saw this, they ran away, and Jesus alone stood still. And the parents
of the dead child coming, reproached1747…and they threatened Him. And Jesus leaped
down from the roof, and stood beside the body of the child, and cried with a loud voice,
and said: Zeno—for that was his name—stand up, and tell me; did I throw thee down? And
he stood up immediately, and said: Certainly not, my lord; thou didst not throw me down,
<note type="footnote">the letters, and began the first letter Aleph; and Jesus says the second, Beth, Gimel, and told him all the letters
to the end. And shutting the book, He taught the master the prophets.</note>
<note type="footnote">1746 Instead of this chapter, the Paris ms. has: And he was ashamed and perplexed, because he knew not
whence he knew the letters. And he arose, and went home, in great astonishment at this strange thing. It then

but hast raised me up. And those that saw this were struck with astonishment. And the
child’s parents glorified God on account of the miracle that had happened, and adored Jesus.
1748</p>
<p>10. A few days after, a young man was splitting wood in the corner,1749and the axe
came down and cut the sole of his foot in two, and he died from loss of blood. And there
was a great commotion, and people ran together, and the child Jesus ran there too. And He
pressed through the crowd, and laid hold of the young man’s wounded foot, and he was
cured immediately. And He said to the young man: Rise up now, split the wood, and remember
me. And the crowd seeing what had happened, adored the child, saying: Truly
the Spirit of God dwells in this child.</p>
<p>11. And when He was six years old, His mother gave Him a pitcher, and sent Him to
draw water, and bring it into the house. But He struck against some one in the crowd, and
the pitcher was broken. And Jesus unfolded the cloak which He had on, and filled it with
water, and carried it to His mother. And His mother, seeing the miracle that had happened,
kissed Him, and kept within herself the mysteries which she had seen Him doing.1750</p>
<p>12. And again in seed-time the child went out with His father to sow corn in their land.
And while His father was sowing, the child Jesus also sowed one grain of corn. And when
He had reaped it, and threshed it, He made a hundred kors;1751 and calling all the poor of
the village to the threshing-floor, He gave them the corn, and Joseph took away what was
left of the corn. And He was eight years old when He did this miracle.1752</p>
<p>13. And His father was a carpenter, and at that time made ploughs and yokes. And a
certain rich man ordered him to make him a couch. And one of what is called the cross
pieces being too short, they did not know what to do. The child Jesus said to His father
Joseph: Put down the two pieces of wood, and make them even in the middle. And Joseph
did as the child said to him. And Jesus stood at the other end, and took hold of the shorter
piece of wood, and stretched it, and made it equal to the other. And His father Joseph saw
it, and wondered, and embraced the child, and blessed Him, saying: Blessed am I, because
God has given me this child.1753</p>
<p>14. And Joseph, seeing that the child was vigorous in mind and body, again resolved
that He should not remain ignorant of the letters, and took Him away, and handed Him
over to another teacher. And the teacher said to Joseph: I shall first teach him the Greek

letters, and then the Hebrew. For the teacher was aware of the trial that had been made of
the child, and was afraid of Him. Nevertheless he wrote out the alphabet, and gave Him all
his attention for a long time, and He made him no answer. And Jesus said to him: If thou
art really a teacher, and art well acquainted with the letters, tell me the power of the Alpha,
and I will tell thee the power of the Beta. And the teacher was enraged at this, and struck
Him on the head. And the child, being in pain, cursed him; and immediately he swooned
away, and fell to the ground on his face. And the child returned to Joseph’s house; and
Joseph was grieved, and gave orders to His mother, saying: Do not let him go outside of
the door, because those that make him angry die.1754</p>
<p>15. And after some time, another master again, a genuine friend of Joseph, said to him:
Bring the child to my school; perhaps I shall be able to flatter him into learning his letters.
And Joseph said: If thou hast the courage, brother, take him with thee. And he took Him
with him in fear and great agony; but the child went along pleasantly. And going boldly
into the school, He found a book lying on the reading-desk; and taking it, He read not the
letters that were in it, but opening His mouth, He spoke by the Holy Spirit, and taught the
law to those that were standing round. And a great crowd having come together, stood by
and heard Him, and wondered at the ripeness of His teaching, and the readiness of His
words, and that He, child as He was, spoke in such a way. And Joseph hearing of it, was
afraid, and ran to the school, in doubt lest his master too should be without experience.1755
And the master said to Joseph: Know, brother, that I have taken the child as a scholar, and
he is full of much grace and wisdom; but I beseech thee, brother, take him home. And when
the child heard this, He laughed at him directly, and said: Since thou hast spoken aright,
and witnessed aright, for thy sake he also that was struck down shall be cured. And immediately
the other master was cured. And Joseph took the child, and went away home.1756</p>
<p>16. And Joseph sent his son James to tie up wood and bring it home, and the child Jesus
also followed him. And when James was gathering the fagots, a viper bit James’ hand. And
when he was racked with pain, and at the point of death, Jesus came near and blew upon
the bite; and the pain ceased directly, and the beast burst, and instantly James remained safe
and sound.1757</p>
<p>17. And after this the infant of one of Joseph’s neighbours fell sick and died, and its
mother wept sore. And Jesus heard that there was great lamentation and commotion, and
ran in haste, and found the child dead, and touched his breast, and said: I say to thee, child,
be not dead, but live, and be with thy mother. And directly it looked up and laughed. And

He said to the woman: Take it, and give it milk, and remember me. And seeing this, the
crowd that was standing by wondered, and said: Truly this child was either God or an angel
of God, for every word of his is a certain fact. And Jesus went out thence, playing with the
other children.1758</p>
<p>18. And some time after there occurred a great commotion while a house was building,
and Jesus stood up and went away to the place. And seeing a man lying dead, He took him
by the hand, and said: Man, I say to thee, arise, and go on with thy work. And directly he
rose up, and adored Him. And seeing this, the crowd wondered, and said: This child is
from heaven, for he has saved many souls from death, and he continues to save during all
his life.</p>
<p>19. And when He was twelve years old His parents went as usual to Jerusalem to the
feast of the passover with their fellow-travellers. And after the passover they were coming
home again. And while they were coming home, the child Jesus went back to Jerusalem.
And His parents thought that He was in the company. And having gone one day’s journey,
they sought for Him among their relations; and not finding Him, they were in great grief,
and turned back to the city seeking for Him. And after the third day they found Him in the
temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing the law and asking them questions.
And they were all attending to Him, and wondering that He, being a child, was shutting the
mouths of the elders and teachers of the people, explaining the main points of the law and
the parables of the prophets. And His mother Mary coming up, said to Him: Why hast
thou done this to us, child? Behold, we have been seeking for thee in great trouble. And
Jesus said to them: Why do you seek me? Do you not know that I must be about my Father’s
business?1759 And the scribes and the Pharisees said: Art thou the mother of this child?
And she said: I am. And they said to her: Blessed art thou among women, for God hath
blessed the fruit of thy womb; for such glory, and such virtue and wisdom, we have neither
seen nor heard ever. And Jesus rose up, and followed His mother, and was subject to His
parents. And His mother observed all these things that had happened. And Jesus advanced
in wisdom, and stature, and grace.1760 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Second Greek Form.</head>
<head>The Writing of the Holy Apostle Thomas Concerning the Childhood
of the Lord.</head>
<p>1. I Thomas the Israelite have deemed it necessary to make known to all the brethren
of the heathen the great things which our Lord Jesus Christ did in His childhood, when He
dwelt in the body in the city of Nazareth, going in the fifth year of His age.</p>
<p>2. On one of the days, there being a rainstorm, He went out of the house where His
mother was, and played on the ground where the waters were flowing. And He made pools,
and brought in the waters, and the pools were filled with water. Then He says: It is my will
that you become clear and excellent waters. And they became so directly. And a certain
boy, the son of Annas the scribe, came past, and with a willow branch which he was carrying
threw down the pools, and the water flowed out. And Jesus turning, said to him: O impious
and wicked, how have the pools wronged thee, that thou hast emptied them? Thou shalt
not go on thy way, and thou shalt be dried up like the branch which thou art carrying. And
as he went along, in a short time he fell down and died. And when the children that were
playing with him saw this, they wondered, and went away and told the father of the dead
boy. And he ran and found his child dead, and he went away and reproached Joseph.</p>
<p>3. And Jesus made of that clay twelve sparrows, and it was the Sabbath. And a child
ran and told Joseph, saying: Behold, thy child is playing about the stream, and of the clay
he has made sparrows, which is not lawful. And when he heard this, he went, and said to
the child: Why dost thou do this, profaning the Sabbath? But Jesus gave him no answer,
but looked upon the sparrows, and said: Go away, fly, and live, and remember me. And at
this word they flew, and went up into the air. And when Joseph saw it, he wondered.</p>
<p>4. And some days after, when Jesus was going through the midst of the city, a boy threw
a stone at Him, and struck Him on the shoulder. And Jesus said to him: Thou shalt not go
on thy way. And directly falling down, he also died. And they that happened to be there
were struck with astonishment, saying: Whence is this child, that every word he says is
certainly accomplished? And they also went and reproached Joseph, saying: It is impossible
for thee to live with us in this city: but if thou wishest to do so, teach thy child to bless, and
not to curse: for he is killing our children, and everything that he says is certainly accomplished.</p>
<p>5. And Joseph was sitting in his seat, and the child stood before him; and he took hold
of Him by the ear, and pinched it hard. And Jesus looked at him steadily, and said: It is
enough for thee.</p>
<p>6. And on the day after he took Him by the hand, and led Him to a certain teacher,
Zacchæus by name, and says to him: O master, take this child, and teach him his letters.

<pb n="1327"/>
And he says: Hand him over to me, brother, and I shall teach him the Scripture; and I shall
persuade him to bless all, and not to curse. And Jesus hearing, laughed, and said to them:
You say what you know; but I know more than you, for I am before the ages. And I know
when your fathers’ fathers were born; and I know how many are the years of your life. And
hearing this, they were struck with astonishment. And again Jesus said to them: You
wonder because I said to you that I knew how many are the years of your life. Assuredly I
know when the world was created. Behold, you do not believe me now. When you see my
cross, then will ye believe that I speak the truth. And they were struck with astonishment
when they heard these things.</p>
<p>7. And Zacchæus, having written the alphabet in Hebrew, says to Him: Alpha. And
the child says: Alpha. And again the teacher: Alpha; and the child likewise. Then again
the teacher says the Alpha for the third time. Then Jesus, looking in the master’s face, says:
How canst thou, not knowing the Alpha, teach another the Beta? And the child, beginning
from the Alpha, said by Himself the twenty-two letters. Then also He says again: Hear, O
teacher, the order of the first letter, and know how many entrances and lines it has, and
strokes common, crossing and coming together.1761 And when Zacchæus heard such an
account of the one letter, he was so struck with astonishment, that he could make no answer.
And he turned and said to Joseph: This child assuredly, brother, does not belong to the
earth. Take him, then, away from me.</p>
<p>8. And after these things, on one of the days Jesus was playing with other children on
the roof of a house. And one boy was pushed by another, and hurled down upon the ground,
and he died. And seeing this, the boys that were playing with him ran away; and Jesus only
was left standing upon the roof from which the boy had been hurled down. And when the
news was brought to the parents of the dead boy, they ran weeping; and finding their boy
lying dead upon the ground, and Jesus standing above, they supposed that their boy had
been thrown down by Him; and fixing their eyes upon Him, they reviled Him. And seeing
this, Jesus directly came down from the roof, and stood at the head of the dead body, and
says to him: Zeno, did I throw thee down? Stand up, and tell us. For this was the name of
the boy. And at the word the boy stood up and adored Jesus, and said: My lord, thou didst
not throw me down, but thou hast brought me to life when I was dead.</p>
<p>9. And a few days after, one of the neighbours, when splitting wood, cut away the lower
part of his foot with the axe, and was on the point of death from loss of blood. And a great
number of people ran together, and Jesus came with them to the place. And He took hold
of the young man’s wounded foot, and cured him directly, and says to him: Rise up, split
thy wood. And he rose up and adored Him, giving thanks, and splitting the wood. Likewise
also all that were there wondered, and gave thanks to Him.</p>
<note type="footnote">1761 [Compare the account in the version of the first Greek form, chap. 6, and the footnote.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1328"/>
<p>10. And when He was six years old, Mary His mother sent Him to bring water from
the fountain. And as He went along, the pitcher was broken. And going to the fountain
He unfolded His overcoat, and drew water from the fountain, and filled it, and took the
water to His mother. And seeing this, she was struck with astonishment, and embraced
Him, and kissed Him.</p>
<p>11. And when Jesus had come to the eighth year of His age, Joseph was ordered by a
certain rich man to make him a couch. For he was a carpenter. And he went out into the
field to get wood; and Jesus went with him. And having cut two pieces of wood, and
smoothed them with the axe, he put the one beside the other; and in measuring he found
it too short. And when he saw this he was grieved, and sought to find another piece. And
seeing this, Jesus says to him: Put these two pieces together, so as to make both ends even.
And Joseph, in doubt as to what the child should mean, did as he was told. And He says to
him again: Take a firm hold of the short piece. And Joseph, in astonishment, took hold of
it. Then Jesus also, taking hold of the other end, drew it towards Himself, and make it equal
to the other piece of wood. And He says to Joseph: Grieve no more, but do thy work without
hindrance. And seeing this, he wondered greatly, and says to himself: Blessed am I, because
God has given me such a boy. And when they came back to the city, Joseph gave an account
of the matter to Mary. And when she heard and saw the strange miracles of her son, she
rejoiced and glorified Him, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and for
evermore. Amen.</p>

<p>When a commotion took place in consequence of the search made by Herod for our

flee into Egypt from the face of those who seek to kill Him. And Jesus was two years old

<p>And as He was walking through a field of corn, He stretched forth His hand, and took
of the ears, and put them over the fire, and rubbed them, and began to eat.</p>

widow, and they remained in the same place one year.
And Jesus was in His third year. And seeing boys playing, He began to play with them.</p>

began to move about. And He said again to the fish: Throw out thy salt which thou hast,
and walk into the water. And it so came to pass. And the neighbours, seeing what had been
done, told it to the widow woman in whose house Mary His mother lived. And as soon as

that teacher saw Him making merry, he said to his scholars with great fury: Go and bring
him to me. And when they had carried Him to the master, he seized Him by the ear, and
said: What didst thou see, to amuse thee so much? And He said to him: Master, see my
hand full of wheat. I showed it to them, and scattered the wheat among them, and they
carry it out of the middle of the street where they are in danger; and on this account they
fought among themselves to divide the wheat. And Jesus did not pass from the place until
it was accomplished. And this being done, the master began to thrust Him out of the city,

<head>Chapter IV.—What the Lord Jesus Did in the City of Nazareth.</head>
<p>It is glorious that Thomas the Israelite and apostle of the Lord gives an account also of
the works of Jesus after He came out of Egypt into Nazareth. Understand all of you, my
dearest brethren, what the Lord Jesus did when He was in the city of Nazareth; the first
chapter of which is as follows:—</p>
<p>And when Jesus was five years old, there fell a great rain upon the earth, and the boy
Jesus walked up and down through it. And there was a terrible rain, and He collected it into
a fish-pond, and ordered it by His word to become clear. And immediately it became so.
Again He took of the clay which was of that fish-pond, and made of it to the number of
twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when Jesus did this among the boys of the Jews.
And the boys of the Jews went away, and said to Joseph His father: Behold, thy son was
playing along with us, and he took clay and made sparrows, which it was not lawful to do
on the Sabbath; and he has broken it. And Joseph went away to the boy Jesus, and said to
Him: Why hast thou done this, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath? And Jesus
opened His hands, and ordered the sparrows, saying: Go up into the air, and fly; nobody
shall kill you. And they flew, and began to cry out, and praise God Almighty. And the Jews
seeing what had happened, wondered, and went away and told the miracles which Jesus
had done. But a Pharisee who was with Jesus took an olive branch, and began to let the
water out of the fountain which Jesus had made. And when Jesus saw this, He said to him
in a rage: Thou impious and ignorant Sodomite, what harm have my works the fountains
of water done thee? Behold, thou shalt become like a dry tree, having neither roots, nor
leaves, nor fruit. And immediately he dried up, and fell to the ground, and died. And his
parents took him away dead, and reproached Joseph, saying: See what thy son has done;
teach him to pray, and not to blaspheme.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—How the Citizens Were Enraged Against Joseph on Account of the

<p>And a few days after, as Jesus was walking through the town with Joseph, one of the
children ran up and struck Jesus on the arm. And Jesus said to him: So shalt thou not finish
thy journey. And immediately he fell to the ground, and died. And those who saw these
wonderful things cried out, saying: Whence is that boy? And they said to Joseph: It is not
right for such a boy to be among us. And Joseph went and brought Him. And they said to
him: Go away from this place; but if thou must live with us, teach him to pray, and not to
blaspheme: but our children have been killed. Joseph called Jesus, and reproved Him, saying:
Why dost thou blaspheme? For these people who live here hate us. And Jesus said: I know
that these words are not mine, but thine; but I will hold my tongue for thy sake: and let
them see to it in their wisdom. And immediately those who were speaking against Jesus
became blind. And they walked up and down, and said: All the words which proceed from
his mouth are accomplished. And Joseph seeing what Jesus had done, in a fury seized Him
by the ear; and Jesus said to Joseph in anger: It is enough for thee to see me, not to touch
me. For thou knowest not who I am; but if thou didst know, thou wouldst not make me
angry. And although just now I am with thee, I was made before thee.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—How Jesus Was Treated by the Schoolmaster.</head>
<p>Therefore a certain man named Zacheus1762 listened to all that Jesus was saying to
Joseph, and in great astonishment said to himself: Such a boy speaking in this way I have
never seen. And he went up to Joseph, and said: That is an intelligent boy of thine; hand
him over to me to learn his letters; and when he has thoroughly learned his letters, I shall
teach him honourably, so that he may be no fool. But Joseph answered and said to him:
No one can teach him but God alone. You do not believe that that little boy will be of little
consequence? And when Jesus heard Joseph speaking in this way, He said to Zacheus: Indeed,
master, whatever proceeds from my mouth is true. And before all I was Lord, but you
are foreigners. To me has been given the glory of the ages, to you has been given nothing;
because I am before the ages. And I know how many years of life thou wilt have, and that
thou wilt be carried into exile: and my Father hath appointed this, that thou mayest understand
that whatever proceeds from my mouth is true. And the Jews who were standing by,
and hearing the words which Jesus spoke, were astonished, and said: We have seen such
wonderful things, and heard such words from that boy, as we have never heard, nor are
likely to hear from any other human being,—either from the high priests, or the masters,
or the Pharisees. Jesus answered and said to them: Why do you wonder? Do you consider
it incredible that I have spoken the truth? I know when both you and your fathers were
born, and to tell you more, when the world was made: I know also who sent me to you.1763
And when the Jews heard the words which the child had spoken, they wondered, because
that they were not able to answer. And, communing with Himself, the child exulted and
said: I have told you a proverb; and I know that you are weak and ignorant.</p>
<p>And that schoolmaster said to Joseph: Bring him to me, and I shall teach him letters.
And Joseph took hold of the boy Jesus, and led Him to the house of a certain schoolmaster,
where other boys were being taught. Now the master in soothing words began to teach Him
His letters, and wrote for Him the first line, which is from A to T,1764 and began to stroke
Him and teach Him. And that teacher struck the child on the head: and when He had received
the blow, the child said to him: I should teach thee, and not thou me; I know the
letters which thou wishest to teach me, and I know that you are to me like vessels from
which there come forth only sounds, and no wisdom. And, beginning the line, He said the
letters from A to T in full, and very fast. And He looked at the master, and said to him:
Thou indeed canst not tell us what A and B are; how dost thou wish to teach others? O hypocrite,
if thou knowest and will tell me about the A, then will I tell thee about the B. And
<note type="footnote">1762 [In this book, the name Zacheus is given in different form, following the Latin.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1763 A slight alteration is here made upon the punctuation of the original.</note>
<note type="footnote">1764 This refers to the Hebrew alphabet.</note>

<pb n="1335"/>
when that teacher began to tell1765 about the first letter, he was unable to give any answer.
And Jesus said to Zacheus: Listen to me, master; understand the first letter. See how it has
two lines; advancing in the middle, standing still, giving, scattering, varying, threatening;
triple intermingled with double; at the same time homogeneous, having all common.1766</p>
<p>And Zacheus, seeing that He so divided the first letter, was stupefied about the first
letter, and about such a human being and such learning; and he cried out, and said: Woe’s
me, for I am quite stupefied; I have brought disgrace upon myself through that child. And
he said to Joseph: I earnestly entreat thee, brother, take him away from me, because I cannot
look upon his face, nor hear his mighty words. Because that child can tame fire and bridle
the sea: for he was born before the ages. What womb brought him forth, or what mother1767
nursed him, I know not. Oh, my friends, I am driven out of my senses; I have become a
wretched laughing-stock. And I said that I had got a scholar; but he has been found to be
my master. And my disgrace I cannot get over, because I am an old man; and what to say
to him I cannot find. All I have to do is to fall into some grievous illness, and depart from
this world; or to leave this town, because all have seen my disgrace. An infant has deceived
me. What answer can I give to others, or what words can I say, because he has got the better
of me in the first letter? I am struck dumb, O my friends and acquaintances; neither beginning
nor end can I find of an answer to him. And now I beseech thee, brother Joseph, take
him away from me, and lead him home, because he is a master, or the Lord, or an angel.
What to say I do not know. And Jesus turned to the Jews who were with Zacheus, and said
to them: Let all not seeing see, and not understanding understand; let the deaf hear, and
let those who are dead through me rise again; and those who are exalted, let me call to still
higher things, as He who sent me to you hath commanded me. And when Jesus ceased
speaking, all who had been affected with any infirmity through His words were made whole.
And they did not dare to speak to Him.</p>

Take hold of this piece of wood by one end, and I by the other; I and let us draw it out. And
they did so; and immediately he found it useful for that which he wished. And He said to
Joseph: Behold, do the work which thou wishest. And Joseph, seeing what He had done,

Hebrew. For the teacher knew that He was very intelligent, and willingly took Him in hand.
And writing for Him the first line, which is A and B, he taught Him for some hours.1772
But Jesus was silent, and made him no answer. Jesus said to the master: If thou art indeed
a master, and if thou indeed knowest the letters, tell me the power1773 of the A, and I shall
tell thee the power of the B. Then His master was filled with fury, and struck Him on the

<p>Many days after came another teacher, a friend of Joseph, and said to him: Hand him

If thou art able, take him and teach him. May it be attended with joy. When the teacher
had taken Him, he went along in fear and in great firmness, and held Him with exultation.
And when He had come to the teacher’s house, He found a book lying there, and took it
and opened it, and did not read what was written in the book; but opened His mouth, and
spoke from the Holy Spirit, and taught the law. And, indeed, all who were standing there
listened to Him attentively; and the master sat down beside Him, and listened to Him with
pleasure, and entreated Him to teach them more. And a great crowd being gathered together,
they heard all the holy teaching which He taught, and the choice words which came forth
from the mouth of Him who, child as He was, spake such things. And Joseph, hearing of
this, was afraid, and running1774…the master, where Jesus was, said to Joseph: Know,
brother, that I have received thy child to teach him or train him; but he is filled with much
gravity and wisdom. Lo, now, take him home with joy, my brother; because the gravity
which he has, has been given him by the Lord. And Jesus, hearing the master thus speaking,
became cheerful, and said: Lo, now, master, thou hast truly said. For thy sake, he who is
dead shall rise again. And Joseph took Him home.</p>

<p>And Joseph sent James to gather straw, and Jesus followed him. And while James was
gathering the straw, a viper bit him; and he fell to the ground, as if dead from the poison.
And Jesus seeing this, blew upon his wound; and immediately James was made whole, and
the viper died.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—How Jesus Raised a Boy to Life.</head>
<p>A few days after, a child, His neighbour, died, and his mother mourned for him sore.
Jesus, hearing this, went and stood over the boy, and knocked upon his breast, and said: I
say to thee, child, do not die, but live. And immediately the child rose up. And Jesus said
to the boy’s mother: Take thy son, and give him the breast, and remember me. And the
crowd, seeing this miracle, said: In truth, this child is from heaven; for already has he freed
many souls from death, and he has made whole all that hope in him.</p>
<p>The scribes and Pharisees said to Mary: Art thou the mother of this child? And Mary
said: Indeed I am. And they said to her: Blessed art thou among women,1775 since God
hath blessed the fruit of thy womb, seeing that He hath given thee such a glorious child, and
such a gift of wisdom, as we have never seen nor heard of. Jesus rose up and followed His
mother. And Mary kept in her heart all the great miracles that Jesus had done among the
people, in healing many that were diseased. And Jesus grew in stature and wisdom; and all
who saw Him glorified God the Father Almighty, who is blessed for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>And all these things I Thomas the Israelite have written what I have seen, and have recounted
them to the Gentiles and to our brethren, and many other things done by Jesus,
who was born in the land of Judah. Behold, the house of Israel has seen all, from the first
even to the last; how great signs and wonders Jesus did among them, which were exceedingly
good, and invisible to their father,1776 as holy Scripture relates, and the prophets have borne
witness to His works in all the peoples of Israel. And He it is who is to judge the world according
to the will of immortality, since He is the Son of God throughout all the world. To
Him is due all glory and honour for ever, who lives and reigns God through all ages of ages.
Amen.</p>

<head>The Arabic Gospel of the Infancy of the Saviour.</head>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, one God.</p>
<p>With the help and favour of the Most High we begin to write a book of the miracles of
our Lord and Master and Saviour Jesus Christ, which is called the Gospel of the Infancy:
in the peace of the Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>1. We find1777 what follows in the book of Joseph the high priest, who lived in the time
of Christ. Some say that he is Caiaphas.1778 He has said that Jesus spoke, and, indeed, when
He was lying in His cradle said to Mary His mother: I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Logos,
whom thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel announced to thee; and my Father has
sent me for the salvation of the world.</p>
<p>2. In the three hundred and ninth year of the era of Alexander, Augustus put forth an
edict, that every man should be enrolled in his native place. Joseph therefore arose, and
taking Mary his spouse, went away to1779 Jerusalem, and came to Bethlehem, to be enrolled
along with his family in his native city. And having come to a cave, Mary told Joseph that
the time of the birth was at hand, and that she could not go into the city; but, said she, let
us go into this cave. This took place at sunset. And Joseph went out in haste to go for a
woman to be near her. When, therefore, he was busy about that, he saw an Hebrew old
woman belonging to Jerusalem, and said: Come hither, my good woman, and go into this
cave, in which there is a woman near her time.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore, after sunset, the old woman, and Joseph with her, came to the cave, and
they both went in. And, behold, it was filled with lights more beautiful than the gleaming
of lamps and candles,1780 and more splendid than the light of the sun. The child, enwrapped
in swaddling clothes, was sucking the breast of the Lady Mary His mother, being placed in
a stall. And when both were wondering at this light, the old woman asks the Lady Mary:
Art thou the mother of this Child? And when the Lady Mary gave her assent, she says:
Thou art not at all like the daughters of Eve. The Lady Mary said: As my son has no equal
among children, so his mother has no equal among women. The old woman replied: My
mistress, I came to get payment; I have been for a long time affected with palsy. Our mistress

<note type="footnote">1779 The Latin translation in Tischendorf has Hierosolyma, which, as the form in the rest of the translation
is feminine, means “from Jerusalem.” But as the Arabic can mean only “to Jerusalem,” the acc. plural of the
neut. form may be here intended.</note>
<note type="footnote">1780 Or, with the lights of lamps and candles, more beautiful than lightning, and more splendid than sunlight.</note>

<pb n="1346"/>
the Lady Mary said to her: Place thy hands upon the child. And the old woman did so, and
was immediately cured. Then she went forth, saying: Henceforth I will be the attendant
and servant of this child all the days of my life.</p>
<p>4. Then came shepherds; and when they had lighted a fire, and were rejoicing greatly,
there appeared to them the hosts of heaven praising and celebrating God Most High. And
while the shepherds were doing the same, the cave was at that time made like a temple of
the upper world, since both heavenly and earthly voices glorified and magnified God on
account of the birth of the Lord Christ. And when that old Hebrew woman saw the manifestation
of those miracles, she thanked God, saying: I give Thee thanks, O God, the God
of Israel, because mine eyes have seen the birth of the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>5. And the time of circumcision, that is, the eighth day, being at hand, the child was to
be circumcised according to the law. Wherefore they circumcised Him in the cave. And
the old Hebrew woman took the piece of skin; but some say that she took the navel-string,
and laid it past in a jar of old oil of nard. And she had a son, a dealer in unguents, and she
gave it to him, saying: See that thou do not sell this jar of unguent of nard, even although
three hundred denarii1781 should be offered thee for it. And this is that jar which Mary the
sinner bought and poured upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, which thereafter
she wiped with the hair of her head.1782 Ten days after, they took Him to Jerusalem; and
on the fortieth day1783 after His birth they carried Him into the temple, and set Him before
the Lord, and offered sacrifices for Him, according to the commandment of the law of Moses,
which is: Every male that openeth the womb shall be called the holy of God.1784</p>
<p>6. Then old Simeon saw Him shining like a pillar of light, when the Lady Mary, His
virgin mother, rejoicing over Him, was carrying Him in her arms. And angels, praising
Him, stood round Him in a circle, like life guards standing by a king. Simeon therefore
went up in haste to the Lady Mary, and, with hands stretched out before her, said to the
Lord Christ: Now, O my Lord, let Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for
mine eyes have seen Thy compassion, which Thou hast prepared for the salvation of all
peoples, a light to all nations, and glory to Thy people Israel. Hanna also, a prophetess, was
present, and came up, giving thanks to God, and calling the Lady Mary blessed.1785</p>
<p>7. And it came to pass, when the Lord Jesus was born at Bethlehem of Judæa, in the
time of King Herod, behold, magi came from the east to Jerusalem, as Zeraduscht1786 had
<note type="footnote">1781 John xii. 5. The denarius was worth about 7-3/4 d.</note>

<pb n="1347"/>
predicted; and there were with them gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. And they
adored Him, and presented to Him their gifts. Then the Lady Mary took one of the swaddling-
bands, and, on account of the smallness of her means, gave it to them; and they received
it from her with the greatest marks of honour. And in the same hour there appeared to
them an angel in the form of that star which had before guided them on their journey; and
they went away, following the guidance of its light, until they arrived in their own country.1787</p>
<p>8. And their kings and chief men came together to them, asking what they had seen or
done, how they had gone and come back, what they had brought with them. And they
showed them that swathing-cloth which the Lady Mary had given them. Wherefore they
celebrated a feast, and, according to their custom, lighted a fire and worshipped it, and threw
that swathing-cloth into it; and the fire laid hold of it, and enveloped it. And when the fire
had gone out, they took out the swathing-cloth exactly as it had been before, just as if the
fire had not touched it. Wherefore they began to kiss it, and to put it on their heads and
their eyes, saying: This verily is the truth without doubt. Assuredly it is a great thing that
the fire was not able to burn or destroy it. Then they took it, and with the greatest honour
laid it up among their treasures.</p>
<p>9. And when Herod saw that the magi had left him, and not come back to him, he
summoned the priests and the wise men, and said to them: Show me where Christ is to be
born. And when they answered, In Bethlehem of Judæa, he began to think of putting the
Lord Jesus Christ to death. Then appeared an angel of the Lord to Joseph in his sleep, and
said: Rise, take the boy and His mother, and go away into Egypt.1788 He rose, therefore,
towards cockcrow, and set out.</p>
<p>10. While he is reflecting how he is to set about his journey, morning came upon him
after he had gone a very little way. And now he was approaching a great city, in which there
was an idol, to which the other idols and gods of the Egyptians offered gifts and vows. And
there stood before this idol a priest ministering to him, who, as often as Satan spoke from
that idol, reported it to the inhabitants of Egypt and its territories. This priest had a son,
three years old, beset by several demons; and he made many speeches and utterances; and
when the demons seized him, he tore his clothes, and remained naked, and threw stones at
the people. And there was a hospital in that city dedicated to that idol. And when Joseph
and the Lady Mary had come to the city, and had turned aside into that hospital, the citizens
were very much afraid; and all the chief men and the priests of the idols came together to
that idol, and said to it: What agitation and commotion is this that has arisen in our land?
The idol answered them: A God has come here in secret, who is God indeed; nor is any god
besides Him worthy of divine worship, because He is truly the Son of God. And when this
<note type="footnote">1787 Matt. ii. 1–12.</note>
<note type="footnote">1788 Matt. ii. 13, 14.</note>

<pb n="1348"/>
land became aware of His presence, it trembled at His arrival, and was moved and shaken;
and we are exceedingly afraid from the greatness of His power. And in the same hour that
idol fell down, and at its fall all, inhabitants of Egypt and others, ran together.</p>
<p>11. And the son of the priest, his usual disease having come upon him, entered the
hospital, and there came upon Joseph and the Lady Mary, from whom all others had fled.
The Lady Mary had washed the cloths of the Lord Christ, and had spread them over some
wood. That demoniac boy, therefore, came and took one of the cloths, and put it on his
head. Then the demons, fleeing in the shape of ravens and serpents, began to go forth out
of his mouth. The boy, being immediately healed at the command of the Lord Christ, began
to praise God, and then to give thanks to the Lord who had healed him. And when his
father saw him restored to health, My son, said he, what has happened to thee? and by what
means hast thou been healed? The son answered: When the demons had thrown me on
the ground, I went into the hospital, and there I found an august woman with a boy, whose
newly-washed cloths she had thrown upon some wood: one of these I took up and put upon
my head, and the demons left me and fled. At this the father rejoiced greatly, and said: My
son, it is possible that this boy is the Son of the living God who created the heavens and the
earth: for when he came over to us, the idol was broken, and all the gods fell, and perished
by the power of his magnificence.</p>
<p>12. Here was fulfilled the prophecy which says, Out of Egypt have I called my son.1789
Joseph indeed, and Mary, when they heard that that idol had fallen down and perished,
trembled, and were afraid. Then they said: When we were in the land of Israel, Herod
thought to put Jesus to death, and on that account slew all the children of Bethlehem and
its confines; and there is no doubt that the Egyptians, as soon as they have heard that this
idol has been broken, will burn us with fire.1790</p>
<p>13. Going out thence, they came to a place where there were robbers who had plundered
several men of their baggage and clothes, and had bound them. Then the robbers heard a
great noise, like the noise of a magnificent king going out of his city with his army, and his
chariots and his drums; and at this the robbers were terrified, and left all their plunder. And
their captives rose up, loosed each other’s bonds, recovered their baggage, and went away.
And when they saw Joseph and Mary coming up to the place, they said to them: Where is
that king, at the hearing of the magnificent sound of whose approach the robbers have left
us, so that we have escaped safe? Joseph answered them: He will come behind us.</p>
<p>14. Thereafter they came into another city, where there was a demoniac woman whom
Satan, accursed and rebellious, had beset, when on one occasion she had gone out by night
<note type="footnote">1789 Hos. xi. 1; Matt. ii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1790 Burning to death was the punishment of those convicted of sacrilege and the practice of magic. It was
inflicted also on slaves for grave offences against their masters.</note>

<pb n="1349"/>
for water. She could neither bear clothes, nor live in a house; and as often as they tied her
up with chains and thongs, she broke them, and fled naked into waste places; and, standing
in cross-roads and cemeteries, she kept throwing stones at people, and brought very heavy
calamities upon her friends. And when the Lady Mary saw her, she pitied her; and upon
this Satan immediately left her, and fled away in the form of a young man, saying: Woe to
me from thee, Mary, and from thy son. So that woman was cured of her torment, and being
restored to her senses, she blushed on account of her nakedness; and shunning the sight of
men, went home to her friends. And after she put on her clothes, she gave an account of
the matter to her father and her friends; and as they were the chief men of the city, they received
the Lady Mary and Joseph with the greatest honour and hospitality.</p>
<p>15. On the day after, being supplied by them with provision for their journey, they went
away, and on the evening of that day arrived at another town, in which they were celebrating
a marriage; but, by the arts of accursed Satan and the work of enchanters, the bride had become
dumb, and could not speak a word. And after the Lady Mary entered the town, carrying
her son the Lord Christ, that dumb bride saw her, and stretched out her hands towards the
Lord Christ, and drew Him to her, and took Him into her arms, and held Him close and
kissed Him, and leaned over Him, moving His body back and forwards. Immediately the
knot of her tongue was loosened, and her ears were opened; and she gave thanks and praise
to God, because He had restored her to health. And that night the inhabitants of that town
exulted with joy, and thought that God and His angels had come down to them.</p>
<p>16. There they remained three days, being held in great honour, and living splendidly.
Thereafter, being supplied by them with provision for their journey, they went away and
came to another city, in which, because it was very populous, they thought of passing the
night. And there was in that city an excellent woman: and once, when she had gone to the
river to bathe, lo, accursed Satan, in the form of a serpent, had leapt upon her, and twisted
himself round her belly; and as often as night came on, he tyrannically tormented her. This
woman, seeing the mistress the Lady Mary, and the child, the Lord Christ, in her bosom,
was struck with a longing for Him, and said to the mistress the Lady Mary: O mistress, give
me this child, that I may carry him, and kiss him. She therefore gave Him to the woman;
and when He was brought to her, Satan let her go, and fled and left her, nor did the woman
ever see him after that day. Wherefore all who were present praised God Most High, and
that woman bestowed on them liberal gifts</p>
<p>17. On the day after, the same woman took scented water to wash the Lord Jesus; and
after she had washed Him, she took the water with which she had done it, and poured part
of it upon a girl who was living there, whose body was white with leprosy, and washed her

<pb n="1350"/>
with it. And as soon as this was done, the girl was cleansed from her leprosy. And the towns
people said: There is no doubt that Joseph and Mary and that boy are gods, not men. And
when they were getting ready to go away from them, the girl who had laboured under the
leprosy came up to them, and asked them to let her go with them.</p>
<p>18. When they had given her permission, she went with them. And afterwards they
came to a city, in which was the castle of a most illustrious prince, who kept a house for the
entertainment of strangers. They turned into this place; and the girl went away to the prince’s
wife; and she found her weeping and sorrowful, and she asked why she was weeping. Do
not be surprised, said she, at my tears; for I am overwhelmed by a great affliction, which as
yet I have not endured to tell to any one. Perhaps, said the girl, if you reveal it and disclose
it to me, I may have a remedy for it. Hide this secret, then, replied the princess, and tell it
to no one. I was married to this prince, who is a king and ruler over many cities, and I lived
long with him, but by me he had no son. And when at length I produced him a son, he was
leprous; and as soon as he saw him, he turned away with loathing, and said to me: Either
kill him, or give him to the nurse to be brought up in some place from which we shall never
hear of him more. After this I can have nothing to do with thee, and I will never see thee
more. On this account I know not what to do, and I am overwhelmed with grief. Alas! my
son. Alas! my husband. Did I not say so? said the girl. I have found a cure for thy disease,
and I shall tell it thee. For I too was a leper; but I was cleansed by God, who is Jesus, the son
of the Lady Mary. And the woman asking her where this God was whom she had spoken
of, Here, with thee, said the girl; He is living in the same house. But how is this possible?
said she. Where is he? There, said the girl, are Joseph and Mary; and the child who is with
them is called Jesus; and He it is who cured me of my disease and my torment. But by what
means, said she, wast thou cured of thy leprosy? Wilt thou not tell me that? Why not? said
the girl. I got from His mother the water in which He had been washed, and poured it over
myself; and so I was cleansed from my leprosy. Then the princess rose up, and invited them
to avail themselves of her hospitality. And she prepared a splendid banquet for Joseph in
a great assembly of the men of the place. And on the following day she took scented water
with which to wash the Lord Jesus, and thereafter poured the same water over her son,
whom she had taken with her; and immediately her son was cleansed from his leprosy.
Therefore, singing thanks and praises to God, she said: Blessed is the mother who bore thee,
O Jesus; dost thou so cleanse those who share the same nature with thee with the water in
which thy body has been washed? Besides, she bestowed great gifts upon the mistress the
Lady Mary, and sent her away with great honour.</p>
<p>19. Coming thereafter to another city, they wished to spend the night in it. They turned
aside, therefore, to the house of a man newly married, but who, under the influence of
witchcraft, was not able to enjoy his wife; and when they had spent that night with him, his

<pb n="1351"/>
bond was loosed. And at daybreak, when they were girding themselves for their journey,
the bridegroom would not let them go, and prepared for them a great banquet.</p>
<p>20. They set out, therefore, on the following day; and as they came near another city,
they saw three women weeping as they came out of a cemetery. And when the Lady Mary
beheld them, she said to the girl who accompanied her: Ask them what is the matter with
them, or what calamity has befallen them. And to the girl’s questions they made no reply,
but asked in their turn: Whence are you, and whither are you going? for the day is already
past, and night is coming on apace. We are travellers, said the girl, and are seeking a house
of entertainment in which we may pass the night. They said: Go with us, and spend the
night with us. They followed them, therefore, and were brought into a new house with
splendid decorations and furniture. Now it was winter; and the girl, going into the chamber
of these women, found them again weeping and lamenting. There stood beside them a
mule, covered with housings of cloth of gold, and sesame was put before him; and the women
were kissing him, and giving him food. And the girl said: What is all the ado, my ladies,
about this mule? They answered her with tears, and said: This mule, which thou seest, was
our brother, born of the same mother with ourselves. And when our father died, and left
us great wealth, and this only brother, we did our best to get him married, and were preparing
his nuptials for him, after the manner of men. But some women, moved by mutual jealousy,
bewitched him unknown to us; and one night, a little before daybreak, when the door of
our house was shut, we saw that this our brother had been turned into a mule, as thou now
beholdest him. And we are sorrowful, as thou seest, having no father to comfort us: there
is no wise man, or magician, or enchanter in the world that we have omitted to send for;
but nothing has done us any good. And as often as our hearts are overwhelmed with grief,
we rise and go away with our mother here, and weep at our father’s grave, and come back
again.</p>
<p>21. And when the girl heard these things, Be of good courage, said she, and weep not:
for the cure of your calamity is near; yea, it is beside you, and in the middle of your own
house. For I also was a leper; but when I saw that woman, and along with her that young
child, whose name is Jesus, I sprinkled my body with the water with which His mother had
washed Him, and I was cured. And I know that He can cure your affliction also. But rise,
go to Mary my mistress; bring her into your house, and tell her your secret; and entreat and
supplicate her to have pity upon you. After the woman had heard the girl’s words, they
went in haste to the Lady Mary, and brought her into their chamber, and sat down before
her weeping, and saying: O our mistress, Lady Mary, have pity on thy hand-maidens; for
no one older than ourselves, and no head of the family, is left—neither father nor brother—to
live with us; but this mule which thou seest was our brother, and women have made him
such as thou seest by witchcraft. We beseech thee, therefore, to have pity upon us. Then,
grieving at their lot, the Lady Mary took up the Lord Jesus, and put Him on the mule’s back;

<pb n="1352"/>
and she wept as well as the women, and said to Jesus Christ: Alas! my son, heal this mule
by Thy mighty power, and make him a man endowed with reason as he was before. And
when these words were uttered by the Lady Mary, his form was changed, and the mule became
a young man, free from every defect. Then he and his mother and his sisters adored
the Lady Mary, and lifted the boy above their heads, and began to kiss Him, saying: Blessed
is she that bore Thee, O Jesus, O Saviour of the world; blessed are the eyes which enjoy the
felicity of seeing Thee.</p>
<p>22. Moreover, both the sisters said to their mother: Our brother indeed, by the aid of
the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the salutary intervention of this girl, who pointed out to us
Mary and her son, has been raised to human form. Now, indeed, since our brother is unmarried,
it would do very well for us to give him as his wife this girl, their servant. And
having asked the Lady Mary, and obtained her consent, they made a splendid wedding for
the girl; and their sorrow being changed into joy, and the beating of their breasts into dancing,
they began to be glad, to rejoice, to exult, and sing—adorned, on account of their great joy,
in most splendid and gorgeous attire. Then they began to recite songs and praises, and to
say: O Jesus, son of David, who turnest sorrow into gladness, and lamentations into joy!
And Joseph and Mary remained there ten days. Thereafter they set out, treated with great
honours by these people, who bade them farewell, and from bidding them farewell returned
weeping, especially the girl.</p>
<p>23. And turning away from this place, they came to a desert; and hearing that it was
infested by robbers, Joseph and the Lady Mary resolved to cross this region by night. But
as they go along, behold, they see two robbers lying in the way, and along with them a great
number of robbers, who were their associates, sleeping. Now those two robbers, into whose
hands they had fallen, were Titus and Dumachus. Titus therefore said to Dumachus: I beseech
thee to let these persons go freely, and so that our comrades may not see them. And
as Dumachus refused, Titus said to him again: Take to thyself forty drachmas from me,
and hold this as a pledge. At the same time he held out to him the belt which he had about
his waist, to keep him from opening his mouth or speaking. And the Lady Mary, seeing
that the robber had done them a kindness, said to him: The Lord God will sustain thee by
His right hand, and will grant thee remission of thy sins. And the Lord Jesus answered, and
said to His mother: Thirty years hence, O my mother, the Jews will crucify me at Jerusalem,
and these two robbers will be raised upon the cross along with me, Titus on my right hand
and Dumachus on my left; and after that day Titus shall go before me into Paradise. And
she said: God keep this from thee, my son. And they went thence towards a city of idols,
which, as they came near it, was changed into sand-hills.</p>

<pb n="1353"/>
<p>24. Hence they turned aside to that sycamore which is now called Matarea,1791 and the
Lord Jesus brought forth in Matarea a fountain in which the Lady Mary washed His shirt.
And from the sweat of the Lord Jesus which she sprinkled there, balsam was produced in
that region.</p>
<p>25. Thence they came down to Memphis, and saw Pharaoh, and remained three years
in Egypt; and the Lord Jesus did in Egypt very many miracles which are recorded neither
in the Gospel of the Infancy nor in the perfect Gospel.</p>
<p>26. And at the end of the three years He came back out of Egypt, and returned. And
when they had arrived at Judæa, Joseph was afraid to enter it; but hearing that Herod was
dead, and that Archelaus his son had succeeded him, he was afraid indeed, but he went into
Judæa. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: O Joseph, go into the city of
Nazareth, and there abide.</p>
<p>Wonderful indeed, that the Lord of the world should be thus borne and carried about
through the world!</p>
<p>27. Thereafter, going into the city of Bethlehem, they saw there many and grievous
diseases infesting the eyes of the children, who were dying in consequence. And a woman
was there with a sick son, whom, now very near death, she brought to the Lady Mary, who
saw him as she was washing Jesus Christ. Then said the woman to her: O my Lady Mary,
look upon this son of mine, who is labouring under a grievous disease. And the Lady Mary
listened to her, and said: Take a little of that water in which I have washed my son, and
sprinkle him with it. She therefore took a little of the water, as the Lady Mary had told her,
and sprinkled it over her son. And when this was done his illness abated; and after sleeping
a little, he rose up from sleep safe and sound. His mother rejoicing at this, again took him
to the Lady Mary. And she said to her: Give thanks to God, because He hath healed this
thy son.</p>
<p>28. There was in the same place another woman, a neighbour of her whose son had
lately been restored to health. And as her son was labouring under the same disease, and
his eyes were now almost blinded, she wept night and day. And the mother of the child that
had been cured said to her: Why dost thou not take thy son to the Lady Mary, as I did with
mine when he was nearly dead? And he got well with that water with which the body of
her son Jesus had been washed. And when the woman heard this from her, she too went
and got some of the same water, and washed her son with it, and his body and his eyes were
instantly made well. Her also, when she had brought her son to her, and disclosed to her

<pb n="1354"/>
all that had happened, the Lady Mary ordered to give thanks to God for her son’s restoration
to health, and to tell nobody of this matter.</p>
<p>29. There were in the same city two women, wives of one man, each having a son ill
with fever. The one was called Mary, and her son’s name was Cleopas. She rose and took
up her son, and went to the Lady Mary, the mother of Jesus, and offering her a beautiful
mantle, said: O my Lady Mary, accept this mantle, and for it give me one small bandage.
Mary did so, and the mother of Cleopas went away, and made a shirt of it, and put it on her
son. So he was cured of his disease; but the son of her rival died. Hence there sprung up
hatred between them; and as they did the house-work week about, and as it was the turn of
Mary the mother of Cleopas, she heated the oven to bake bread; and going away to bring
the lump that she had kneaded, she left her son Cleopas beside the oven. Her rival seeing
him alone—and the oven was very hot with the fire blazing under it—seized him and threw
him into the oven, and took herself off. Mary coming back, and seeing her son Cleopas lying
in the oven laughing, and the oven quite cold, as if no fire had ever come near it, knew that
her rival had thrown him into the fire. She drew him out, therefore, and took him to the
Lady Mary, and told her of what had happened to him. And she said: Keep silence, and
tell nobody of the affair; for I am afraid for you if you divulge it. After this her rival went
to the well to draw water; and seeing Cleopas playing beside the well, and nobody near, she
seized him and threw him into the well, and went home herself. And some men who had
gone to the well for water saw the boy sitting on the surface of the water; and so they went
down and drew him out. And they were seized with a great admiration of that boy, and
praised God. Then came his mother, and took him up, and went weeping to the Lady Mary,
and said: O my lady, see what my rival has done to my son, and how she has thrown him
into the well; she will be sure to destroy him some day or other. The Lady Mary said to her:
God will avenge thee upon her. Thereafter, when her rival went to the well to draw water,
her feet got entangled in the rope, and she fell into the well. Some men came to draw her
out, but they found her skull fractured and her bones broken. Thus she died a miserable
death, and in her came to pass that saying: They have digged a well deep, but have fallen
into the pit which they had prepared.1792</p>
<p>30. Another woman there had twin sons who had fallen into disease, and one of them
died, and the other was at his last breath. And his mother, weeping, lifted him up, and took
him to the Lady Mary, and said: O my lady, aid me and succour me. For I had two sons,
and I have just buried the one, and the other is at the point of death. See how I am going
to entreat and pray to God. And she began to say: O Lord, Thou art compassionate, and
merciful, and full of affection. Thou gavest me two sons, of whom Thou hast taken away
the one: this one at least leave to me. Wherefore the Lady Mary, seeing the fervour of her
<note type="footnote">1792 Ps. vii. 15, lvii. 6.</note>

<pb n="1355"/>
weeping, had compassion on her, and said: Put thy son in my son’s bed, and cover him
with his clothes. And when she had put him in the bed in which Christ was lying, he had
already closed his eyes in death; but as soon as the smell of the clothes of the Lord Jesus
Christ reached the boy, he opened his eyes, and, calling upon his mother with a loud voice,
he asked for bread, and took it and sucked it. Then his mother said: O Lady Mary, now I
know that the power of God dwelleth in thee, so that thy son heals those that partake of the
same nature with himself, as soon as they have touched his clothes. This boy that was healed
is he who in the Gospel is called Bartholomew.</p>
<p>31. Moreover, there was there a leprous woman, and she went to the Lady Mary, the
mother of Jesus, and said: My lady, help me. And the Lady Mary answered: What help
dost thou seek? Is it gold or silver? or is it that thy body be made clean from the leprosy?
And that woman asked: Who can grant me this? And the Lady Mary said to her: Wait a
little, until I shall have washed my son Jesus, and put him to bed. The woman waited, as
Mary had told her; and when she had put Jesus to bed, she held out to the woman the water
in which she had washed His body, and said: Take a little of this water, and pour it over thy
body. And as soon as she had done so, she was cleansed, and gave praise and thanks to God.</p>
<p>32. Therefore, after staying with her three days, she went away; and coming to a city,
saw there one of the chief men, who had married the daughter of another of the chief men.
But when he saw the woman, he beheld between her eyes the mark of leprosy in the shape
of a star; and so the marriage was dissolved, and became null and void. And when that
woman saw them in this condition, weeping and overwhelmed with sorrow, she asked the
cause of their grief. But they said: Inquire not into our condition, for to no one living can
we tell our grief, and to none but ourselves can we disclose it. She urged them, however,
and entreated them to entrust it to her, saying that she would perhaps be able to tell them
of a remedy. And when they showed her the girl, and the sign of leprosy which appeared
between her eyes, as soon as she saw it, the woman said: I also, whom you see here, laboured
under the same disease, when, upon some business which happened to come in my way, I
went to Bethlehem. There going into a cave, I saw a woman named Mary, whose son was
he who was named Jesus; and when she saw that I was a leper, she took pity on me, and
handed me the water with which she had washed her son’s body. With it I sprinkled my
body, and came out clean. Then the woman said to her: Wilt thou not, O lady, rise and go
with us, and show us the Lady Mary? And she assented; and they rose and went to the Lady
Mary, carrying with them splendid gifts. And when they had gone in, and presented to her
the gifts, they showed her the leprous girl whom they had brought. The Lady Mary therefore
said: May the compassion of the Lord Jesus Christ descend upon you; and handling to them
also a little of the water in which she had washed the body of Jesus Christ, she ordered the
wretched woman to be bathed in it. And when this had been done, she was immediately
cured; and they, and all standing by, praised God. Joyfully therefore they returned to their

<pb n="1356"/>
own city, praising the Lord for what He had done. And when the chief heard that his wife
had been cured, he took her home, and made a second marriage, and gave thanks to God
for the recovery of his wife’s health.</p>
<p>33. There was there also a young woman afflicted by Satan; for that accursed wretch
repeatedly appeared to her in the form of a huge dragon, and prepared to swallow her. He
also sucked out all her blood, so that she was left like a corpse. As often as he came near
her, she, with her hands clasped over her head, cried out, and said: Woe, woe’s me, for
nobody is near to free me from that accursed dragon. And her father and mother, and all
who were about her or saw her, bewailed her lot; and men stood round her in a crowd, and
all wept and lamented, especially when she wept, and said: Oh, my brethren and friends, is
there no one to free me from that murderer? And the daughter of the chief who had been
healed of her leprosy, hearing the girl’s voice, went up to the roof of her castle, and saw her
with her hands clasped over her head weeping, and all the crowds standing round her
weeping as well. She therefore asked the demoniac’s husband whether his wife’s mother
were alive. And when he answered that both her parents were living, she said: Send for her
mother to come to me. And when she saw that he had sent for her, and she had come, she
said: Is that distracted girl thy daughter? Yes, O lady, said that sorrowful and weeping
woman, she is my daughter. The chief’s daughter answered: Keep my secret, for I confess
to thee that I was formerly a leper; but now the Lady Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, has
healed me. But if thou wishest thy daughter to be healed, take her to Bethlehem, and seek
Mary the mother of Jesus, and believe that thy daughter will be healed; I indeed believe that
thou wilt come back with joy, with thy daughter healed. As soon as the woman heard the
words of the chief’s daughter, she led away her daughter in haste; and going to the place
indicated, she went to the Lady Mary, and revealed to her the state of her daughter. And
the Lady Mary hearing her words, gave her a little of the water in which she had washed the
body of her son Jesus, and ordered her to pour it on the body of her daughter. She gave her
also from the clothes of the Lord Jesus a swathing-cloth, saying: Take this cloth, and show
it to thine enemy as often as thou shalt see him. And she saluted them, and sent them away.</p>
<p>34. When, therefore, they had gone away from her, and returned to their own district,
and the time was at hand at which Satan was wont to attack her, at this very time that accursed
one appeared to her in the shape of a huge dragon, and the girl was afraid at the sight of
him. And her mother said to her: Fear not, my daughter; allow him to come near thee, and
then show him the cloth which the Lady Mary hath given us, and let us see what will happen.
Satan, therefore, having come near in the likeness of a terrible dragon, the body of the girl
shuddered for fear of him; but as soon as she took out the cloth, and placed it on her head,
and covered her eyes with it, flames and live coals began to dart forth from it, and to be cast
upon the dragon. O the great miracle which was done as soon as the dragon saw the cloth
of the Lord Jesus, from which the fire darted, and was cast upon his head and eyes! He cried

<pb n="1357"/>
out with a loud voice: What have I to do with thee, O Jesus, son of Mary? Whither shall I
fly from thee? And with great fear he turned his back and departed from the girl, and never
afterwards appeared to her. And the girl now had rest from him, and gave praise and thanks
to God, and along with her all who were present at that miracle.</p>
<p>35. Another woman was living in the same place, whose son was tormented by Satan.
He, Judas by name, as often as Satan seized him, used to bite all who came near him; and if
he found no one near him, he used to bite his own hands and other limbs. The mother of
this wretched creature, then, hearing the fame of the Lady Mary and her son Jesus, rose up
and brought her son Judas with her to the Lady Mary. In the meantime, James and Joses
had taken the child the Lord Jesus with them to play with the other children; and they had
gone out of the house and sat down, and the Lord Jesus with them. And the demoniac Judas
came up, and sat down at Jesus’ right hand: then, being attacked by Satan in the same
manner as usual, he wished to bite the Lord Jesus, but was not able; nevertheless he struck
Jesus on the right side, whereupon He began to weep. And immediately Satan went forth
out of that boy, fleeing like a mad dog. And this boy who struck Jesus, and out of whom
Satan went forth in the shape of a dog, was Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him to the Jews;
and that same side on which Judas struck Him, the Jews transfixed with a lance.1793</p>
<p>36. Now, when the Lord Jesus had completed seven years from His birth, on a certain
day He was occupied with boys of His own age. For they were playing among clay, from
which they were making images of asses, oxen, birds, and other animals; and each one
boasting of his skill, was praising his own work. Then the Lord Jesus said to the boys: The
images that I have made I will order to walk. The boys asked Him whether then he were
the son of the Creator; and the Lord Jesus bade them walk. And they immediately began
to leap; and then, when He had given them leave, they again stood still. And He had made
figures of birds and sparrows, which flew when He told them to fly, and stood still when He
told them to stand, and ate and drank when He handed them food and drink. After the
boys had gone away and told this to their parents, their fathers said to them: My sons, take
care not to keep company with him again, for he is a wizard: flee from him, therefore, and
avoid him, and do not play with him again after this.</p>
<p>37. On a certain day the Lord Jesus, running about and playing with the boys, passed
the shop of a dyer, whose name was Salem; and he had in his shop many pieces of cloth
which he was to dye. The Lord Jesus then, going into his shop, took up all the pieces of
cloth, and threw them into a tub full of indigo. And when Salem came and saw his cloths
destroyed, he began to cry out with a loud voice, and to reproach Jesus, saying: Why hast
thou done this to me, O son of Mary? Thou hast disgraced me before all my townsmen:
for, seeing that every one wished the colour that suited himself, thou indeed hast come and
<note type="footnote">1793 John xix. 34.</note>

<pb n="1358"/>
destroyed them all. The Lord Jesus answered: I shall change for thee the colour of any piece
of cloth which thou shalt wish to be changed. And immediately He began to take the pieces
of cloth out of the tub, each of them of that colour which the dyer wished, until He had
taken them all out. When the Jews saw this miracle and prodigy, they praised God.</p>
<p>38. And Joseph used to go about through the whole city, and take the Lord Jesus with
him, when people sent for him in the way of his trade to make for them doors, and milkpails,
and beds, and chests; and the Lord Jesus was with him wherever he went. As often,
therefore, as Joseph had to make anything a cubit or a span longer or shorter, wider or
narrower, the Lord Jesus stretched His hand towards it; and as soon as He did so, it became
such as Joseph wished. Nor was it necessary for him to make anything with his own hand,
for Joseph was not very skilful in carpentry.</p>
<p>39. Now, on a certain day, the king of Jerusalem sent for him, and said: I wish thee,
Joseph, to make for me a throne to fit that place in which I usually sit. Joseph obeyed, and
began the work immediately, and remained in the palace two years, until he finished the
work of that throne. And when he had it carried to its place, he perceived that each side
wanted two spans of the prescribed measure. And the king, seeing this, was angry with
Joseph; and Joseph, being in great fear of the king, spent the night without supper, nor did
he taste anything at all. Then, being asked by the Lord Jesus why he was afraid, Joseph said:
Because I have spoiled all the work that I have been two years at. And the Lord Jesus said
to him: Fear not, and do not lose heart; but do thou take hold of one side of the throne; I
shall take the other; and we shall put that to rights. And Joseph, having done as the Lord
Jesus had said and each having drawn by his own side, the throne was put to rights, and
brought to the exact measure of the place. And those that stood by and saw this miracle
were struck with astonishment, and praised God. And the woods used in that throne were
of those which are celebrated in the time of Solomon the son of David; that is, woods of
many and various kinds.</p>
<p>40. On another day the Lord Jesus went out into the road, and saw the boys that had
come together to play, and followed them; but the boys hid themselves from Him. The Lord
Jesus, therefore, having come to the door of a certain house, and seen some women standing
there, asked them where the boys had gone; and when they answered that there was no one
there, He said again: Who are these whom you see in the furnace?1794 They replied that
they were kids of three years old. And the Lord Jesus cried out, and said: Come out hither,
O kids, to your Shepherd. Then the boys, in the form of kids, came out, and began to dance
round Him; and the women, seeing this, were very much astonished, and were seized with
trembling, and speedily supplicated and adored the Lord Jesus, saying: O our Lord Jesus,
son of Mary, Thou art of a truth that good Shepherd of Israel; have mercy on Thy handmaid-
<note type="footnote">1794 Perhaps the correct reading is fornice, archway, and not fornace.</note>

<pb n="1359"/>
ens who stand before Thee, and who have never doubted: for Thou hast come, O our Lord,
to heal, and not to destroy. And when the Lord Jesus answered that the sons of Israel were
like the Ethiopians among the nations, the women said: Thou, O Lord, knowest all things,
nor is anything hid from Thee; now, indeed, we beseech Thee, and ask Thee of Thy affection
to restore these boys Thy servants to their former condition. The Lord Jesus therefore said:
Come, boys, let us go and play. And immediately, while these women were standing by,
the kids were changed into boys.</p>
<p>41. Now in the month Adar, Jesus, after the manner of a king, assembled the boys together.
They spread their clothes on the ground, and He sat down upon them. Then they
put on His head a crown made of flowers, and, like chamber-servants, stood in His presence,
on the right and on the left, as if He were a king. And whoever passed by that way was forcibly
dragged by the boys, saying: Come hither, and adore the king; then go thy way.</p>
<p>42. In the meantime, while these things were going on, some men came up carrying a
boy. For this boy had gone into the mountain with those of his own age to seek wood, and
there he found a partridge’s nest; and when he stretched out his hand to take the eggs from
it, a venomous serpent bit him from the middle of the nest, so that he called out for help.
His comrades accordingly went to him with haste, and found him lying on the ground like
one dead. Then his relations came and took him up to carry him back to the city. And after
they had come to that place where the Lord Jesus was sitting like a king, and the rest of the
boys standing round Him like His servants, the boys went hastily forward to meet him who
had been bitten by the serpent, and said to his relations: Come and salute the king. But
when they were unwilling to go, on account of the sorrow in which they were, the boys
dragged them by force against their will. And when they had come up to the Lord Jesus,
He asked them why they were carrying the boy. And when they answered that a serpent
had bitten him, the Lord Jesus said to the boys: Let us go and kill that serpent. And the
parents of the boy asked leave to go away, because their son was in the agony of death; but
the boys answered them, saying: Did you not hear the king saying: Let us go kill the serpent?
and will you not obey him? And so, against their will the couch was carried back. And
when they came to the nest, the Lord Jesus said to the boys: Is this the serpent’s place? They
said that it was; and the serpent, at the call of the Lord, came forth without delay, and submitted
itself to Him. And He said to it: Go away, and suck out all the poison which thou
hast infused into this boy. And so the serpent crawled to the boy, and sucked out all its
poison. Then the Lord Jesus cursed it, and immediately on this being done it burst asunder;
and the Lord Jesus stroked the boy with his hand, and he was healed. And he began to weep;

<pb n="1360"/>
but Jesus said: Do not weep, for by and by thou shalt be my disciple. And this is Simon the
Cananite,1795 of whom mention is made in the Gospel.1796</p>
<p>43. On another day, Joseph sent his son James to gather wood, and the Lord Jesus went
with him as his companion. And when they had come to the place where the wood was,
and James had begun to gather it, behold, a venomous viper bit his hand, so that he began
to cry out and weep. The Lord Jesus then, seeing him in this condition, went up to him,
and blew upon the place where the viper had bitten him; and this being done, he was healed
immediately.</p>
<p>44. One day, when the Lord Jesus was again with the boys playing on the roof of a house,
one of the boys fell down from above, and immediately expired. And the rest of the boys
fled in all directions, and the Lord Jesus was left alone on the roof. And the relations of the
boy came up and said to the Lord Jesus: It was thou who didst throw our son headlong
from the roof. And when He denied it, they cried out, saying: Our son is dead, and here is
he who has killed him. And the Lord Jesus said to them: Do not bring an evil report against
me; but if you do not believe me, come and let us ask the boy himself, that he may bring the
truth to light. Then the Lord Jesus went down, and standing over the dead body, said, with
a loud voice: Zeno, Zeno, who threw thee down from the roof? Then the dead boy answered
and said: My lord, it was not thou who didst throw me down, but such a one cast me down
from it. And when the Lord commanded those who were standing by to attend to His words,
all who were present praised God for this miracle.</p>
<p>45. Once upon a time the Lady Mary had ordered the Lord Jesus to go and bring her
water from the well. And when He had gone to get the water, the pitcher already full was
knocked against something, and broken. And the Lord Jesus stretched out His handkerchief,
and collected the water, and carried it to His mother; and she was astonished at it. And she
hid and preserved in her heart all that she saw.</p>
<p>46. Again, on another day, the Lord Jesus was with the boys at a stream of water, and
they had again made little fish-ponds. And the Lord Jesus had made twelve sparrows, and
had arranged them round His fish-pond, three on each side. And it was the Sabbath-day.
Wherefore a Jew, the son of Hanan, coming up, and seeing them thus engaged, said in anger
and great indignation: Do you make figures of clay on the Sabbath-day? And he ran quickly,
and destroyed their fish-ponds. But when the Lord Jesus clapped His hands over the sparrows
which He had made, they flew away chirping.</p>
<note type="footnote">1795 [So the Latin; but the Greek word in the Gospels is equivalent to “zealot.” See Rev. Vers. in the lists of
the Apostles.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1796 Matt. x. 4, etc.</note>

<pb n="1361"/>
<p>Then the son of Hanan came up to the fish-pond of Jesus also, and kicked it with his
shoes, and the water of it vanished away. And the Lord Jesus said to him: As that water has
vanished away, so thy life shall likewise vanish away. And immediately that boy dried up.</p>
<p>47. At another time, when the Lord Jesus was returning home with Joseph in the
evening, He met a boy, who ran up against Him with so much force that He fell. And the
Lord Jesus said to him: As thou hast thrown me down, so thou shalt fall and not rise again.
And the same hour the boy fell down, and expired.</p>
<p>48. There was, moreover, at Jerusalem, a certain man named Zacchæus, who taught
boys. He said to Joseph: Why, O Joseph, dost thou not bring Jesus to the to learn his letters?
Joseph agreed to do so, and reported the matter to the Lady Mary. They therefore took Him
to the master; and he, as soon as he saw Him, wrote out the alphabet for Him, and told Him
to say Aleph. And when He had said Aleph, the master ordered Him to pronounce Beth.
And the Lord Jesus said to him: Tell me first the meaning of the letter Aleph, and then I
shall pronounce Beth. And when the master threatened to flog Him, the Lord Jesus explained
to him the meanings of the letters Aleph and Beth; also which figures of the letter were
straight, which crooked, which drawn round into a spiral, which marked with points, which
without them, why one letter went before another; and many other things He began to recount
and to elucidate which the master himself had never either heard or read in any book.
The Lord Jesus, moreover, said to the master: Listen, and I shall say them to thee. And He
began clearly and distinctly to repeat Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, on to Tau. And the master
was astonished, and said: I think that this boy was born before Noah. And turning to Joseph,
he said: Thou hast brought to me to be taught a boy more learned than all the masters. To
the Lady Mary also he said: This son of thine has no need of instruction.</p>
<p>49. Thereafter they took Him to another and a more learned master, who, when he saw
Him, said: Say Aleph. And when He had said Aleph, the master ordered him to pronounce
Beth. And the Lord Jesus answered him, and said: First tell me the meaning of the letter
Aleph, and then I shall pronounce Beth. And when the master hereupon raised his hand
and flogged Him, immediately his hand dried up, and he died. Then said Joseph, to the
Lady Mary: From this time we shall not let him go out of the house, since every one who
opposes him is struck dead.</p>
<p>50. And when He was twelve years old, they took Him to Jerusalem to the feast. And
when the feast was finished, they indeed returned; but the Lord Jesus remained in the temple
among the teachers and elders and learned men of the sons of Israel, to whom He put various
questions upon the sciences, and gave answers in His turn.1797 For He said to them: Whose
son is the Messias? They answered Him: The son of David. Wherefore then, said He, does
<note type="footnote">1797 Luke ii. 42–47. [A comparison of the two narratives is very suggestive. The Evangelist Luke does not
present any such monster of precocity, nor does he adventure into discussions “upon the sciences.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="1362"/>
he in the Spirit call him his lord, when he says, The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right
hand, that I may put thine enemies under thy footsteps?1798 Again the chief of the teachers
said to Him: Hast thou read the books? Both the books, said the Lord Jesus, and the things
contained in the books. And He explained the books, and the law, and the precepts, and
the statutes, and the mysteries, which are contained in the books of the prophets—things
which the understanding of no creature attains to. That teacher therefore said: I hitherto
have neither attained to nor heard of such knowledge: Who, pray, do you think that boy
will be?</p>
<p>51. And a philosopher who was there present, a skilful astronomer, asked the Lord Jesus
whether He had studied astronomy. And the Lord Jesus answered him, and explained the
number of the spheres, and of the heavenly bodies, their natures and operations; their opposition;
their aspect, triangular, square, and sextile; their course, direct and retrograde; the
twenty-fourths,1799 and sixtieths of twenty-fourths; and other things beyond the reach of
reason.</p>
<p>52. There was also among those philosophers one very skilled in treating of natural
science, and he asked the Lord Jesus whether He had studied medicine. And He, in reply,
explained to him physics and metaphysics, hyperphysics and hypophysics, the powers likewise
and humours of the body, and the effects of the same; also the number of members and
bones, of veins, arteries, and nerves; also the effect of heat and dryness, of cold and moisture,
and what these give rise to; what was the operation of the soul upon the body, and its perceptions
and powers; what was the operation of the faculty of speech, of anger, of desire;
lastly, their conjunction and disjunction, and other things beyond the reach of any created
intellect. Then that philosopher rose up, and adored the Lord Jesus, and said: O Lord, from

<p>53. While they were speaking to each other of these and other things, the Lady Mary
came, after having gone about seeking Him for three days along with Joseph. She therefore,
seeing Him sitting among the teachers asking them questions, and answering in His turn,
said to Him: My son, why hast thou treated us thus? Behold, thy father and I have sought
thee with great trouble. But He said: Why do you seek me? Do you not know that I ought
to occupy myself in my Father’s house? But they did not understand the words that He
spoke to them. Then those teachers asked Mary whether He were her son; and when she
signified that He was, they said: Blessed art thou, O Mary, who hast brought forth such a
son. And returning with them to Nazareth, He obeyed them in all things. And His mother

<p>Prologue.—I Ananias, of the proprætor’s body-guard, being learned in the law, knowing
our Lord Jesus Christ from the Holy Scriptures, coming to Him by faith, and counted worthy
of the holy baptism, searching also the memorials written at that time of what was done in
the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the Jews had laid up in the time of Pontius Pilate,
found these memorials written in Hebrew, and by the favour of God have translated them
into Greek for the information of all who call upon the name of our Master Jesus Christ, in
the seventeenth year of the reign of our Lord Flavius Theodosius, and the sixth of Flavius
Valentinianus, in the ninth indiction.1802</p>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>Having called a council, the high priests and scribes Annas and Caiaphas and Semes
and Dathaes, and Gamaliel, Judas, Levi and Nephthalim, Alexander and Jaïrus,1804 and the
rest of the Jews, came to Pilate accusing Jesus about many things, saying: We know this
man to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is the Son of
God, and a king; moreover, he profanes the Sabbath, and wishes to do away with the law of
our fathers. Pilate says: And what are the things which he does, to show that he wishes to
do away with it?1805 The Jews say: We have a law not to cure any one on the Sabbath; but
this man1806 has on the Sabbath cured the lame and the crooked, the withered and the blind
and the paralytic, the dumb and the demoniac, by evil practices. Pilate says to them: What
evil practices? They say to him: He is a magician, and by Beelzebul prince of the demons
he casts out the demons, and all are subject to him. Pilate says to them: This is not casting
out the demons by an unclean spirit, but by the god Æsculapius.</p>
<p>The Jews say to Pilate: we entreat your highness that he stand at thy tribunal, and be
heard.1807 And Pilate having called them, says: Tell me how I, being a procurator, can try
a king? They say to him: We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says that he is.
And Pilate having called the runner, says to him: Let Jesus be brought in with respect. And
the runner going out, and recognising Him, adored Him, and took his cloak into his hand,
and spread it on the ground, and says to him: My lord, walk on this, and come in, for the
procurator calls thee. And the Jews seeing what the runner had done, cried out against Pilate,
saying: Why hast thou ordered him to come in by a runner, and not by a crier? for assuredly
the runner, when he saw him, adored him, and spread his doublet on the ground, and made
him walk like a king.</p>
<p>And Pilate having called the runner, says to him: Why hast thou done this, and spread
out thy cloak upon the earth, and made Jesus walk upon it? The runner says to him: My
lord procurator, when thou didst send me to Jerusalem to Alexander,1808 I saw him sitting
upon an ass, and the sons of the Hebrews held branches in their hands, and shouted; and
other spread their clothes under him saying, Save now, thou who art in the highest: blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.1809</p>

<p>The Jews cry out, and say to the runner: The sons of the Hebrews shouted in Hebrew;
whence then hast thou the Greek? The runner says to them: I asked one of the Jews, and
said, What is it they are shouting in Hebrew? And he interpreted it for me. Pilate says to
them: And what did they shout in Hebrew? The Jews say to him: Hosanna membrome
Baruchamma Adonaï.1810 Pilate says to them: And this hosanna, etc., how is it interpreted?
The Jews say to him: Save now in the highest; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord. Pilate says to them: If you bear witness to the words spoken by the children, in what
has the runner done wrong? And they were silent. And the procurator says to the runner:
Go out, and bring him in what way thou wilt. And the runner going out, did in the same
manner as before, and says to Jesus: My lord, come in; the procurator calleth thee.</p>
<p>And Jesus going in, and the standard-bearers holding their standards, the tops of the
standards were bent down, and adored Jesus. And the Jews seeing the bearing of the
standards, how they were bent down and adored Jesus, cried1811 out vehemently against
the standard-bearers. And Pilate says to the Jews: Do you not wonder how the tops of the
standards were bent down, and adored Jesus? The Jews say to Pilate: We saw how the
standard-bearers bent them down, and adored him. And the procurator having called the
standard-bearers, says to them: Why have you done this? They say to Pilate: We are Greeks
and temple-slaves, and how could we adore him? and assuredly, as we were holding them
up, the tops bent down of their own accord, and adored him.</p>
<p>Pilate says to the rulers of the synagogue and the elders of the people: Do you choose
for yourselves men strong and powerful, and let them hold up the standards, and let us see
whether they will bend down with them. And the elders of the Jews picked out twelve men
powerful and strong, and made them hold up the standards six by six; and they were placed
in front of the procurator’s tribunal. And Pilate says to the runner: Take him outside of
the prætorium, and bring him in again in whatever way may please thee. And Jesus and
the runner went out of the prætorium. And Pilate, summoning those who had formerly
held up the standards, says to them: I have sworn by the health of Cæsar, that if the standards
do not bend down when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads. And the procurator
ordered Jesus to come in the second time. And the runner did in the same manner as before,
and made many entreaties to Jesus to walk on his cloak. And He walked on it, and went
in. And as He went in, the standards were again bent down, and adored Jesus.</p>

<p>And Pilate seeing this, was afraid, and sought to go away from the tribunal; but when
he was still thinking of going away, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with
this just man, for many things have I suffered on his account this night.1812 And Pilate,
summoning the Jews, says to them: You know that my wife is a worshipper of God, and
prefers to adhere to the Jewish religion along with you. They say to him: Yes; we know.
Pilate says to them: Behold, my wife1813 has sent to me, saying, Have nothing to do with
this just man, for many things have I suffered on account of him this night. And the Jews
answering, say unto Pilate: Did we not tell thee that he was a sorcerer?1814 behold, he has
sent a dream to thy wife.</p>
<p>And Pilate, having summoned Jesus, says to Him: What do these witness against thee?
Sayest thou nothing? And Jesus said: Unless they had the power, they would say nothing;
for every one has the power of his own mouth to speak both good and evil. They shall see
to it.1815</p>
<p>And the elders of the Jews answered, and said to Jesus: What shall we see? first, that
thou wast born of fornication; secondly, that thy birth in Bethlehem was the cause of the
murder of the infants; thirdly, that thy father Joseph and thy mother Mary fled into Egypt
because they had no confidence in the people.</p>
<p>Some of the bystanders, pious men of the Jews, say: we deny that he was born of fornication;
for we know that Joseph espoused Mary, and he was not born of fornication. Pilate
says to the Jews who said that he was of fornication: This story of yours is not true, because
they were betrothed, as also these fellow-countrymen of yours say. Annas and Caiaphas
say to Pilate: All the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication, and are not
believed; these are proselytes, and his disciples. And Pilate, calling Annas and Caiaphas,
says to them: What are proselytes? They say to him: They are by birth children of the
Greeks, and have now become Jews. And those that said that He was not born of fornication,
viz.—Lazarus, Asterius, Antonius, James, Amnes, Zeras, Samuel, Isaac, Phinees, Crispus,
Agrippas, and Judas1816—say: We are not proselytes, but are children of the Jews, and speak
of the truth; for we were present at the betrothal of Joseph and Mary.</p>
<p>And Pilate, calling these twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, says
to them: I adjure you by the health of Cæsar, to tell me whether it be true that you say, that

he was not born of fornication. They say to Pilate: We have a law against taking oaths, because
it is a sin; but they will swear by the health of Cæsar,1817 that it is not as we have said,
and we are liable to death. Pilate says to Annas and Caiaphas: Have you nothing to answer
to this? Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate: These twelve are believed when they say that he
was not born of fornication; all the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication,
and that he is a sorcerer, and he says that he is the Son of God and a king, and we are not
believed.</p>
<p>And Pilate orders all the multitude to go out, except the twelve men who said that He
was not born of fornication, and he ordered Jesus to be separated from them. And Pilate
says to them: For what reason do they wish to put him to death? They say to him: They
are angry because he cures on the Sabbath. Pilate says: For a good work do they wish to
put him to death? They say to him: Yes.</p>

<p>And Pilate, filled with rage, went outside of the prætorium, and said to them: I take the
sun to witness1818 that I find no fault in this man. The Jews answered and said to the procurator:
Unless this man were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to thee. And
Pilate said, Do you take him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to Pilate:
It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. Pilate said: Has God said that you are not to
put to death, but that I am?</p>
<p>And Pilate went again into the prætorium, and spoke to Jesus privately, and said to
Him: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus answered Pilate: Dost thou say this of thyself,
or have others said it to thee of me? Pilate answered Jesus: Am I also a Jew?1819 Thy nation
and the chief priests have given thee up to me. What hast thou done? Jesus answered: My
kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight
in order that I should not be given up to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from thence.
Pilate said to Him: Art thou then a king? Jesus answered him: Thou sayest that I am a
king. Because for this have I been born, and have I come, in order that every one who is of
the truth might hear my voice. Pilate says to him: What is truth? Jesus says to him: Truth
is from heaven. Pilate says: Is truth not upon earth? Jesus says to Pilate: Thou seest how
those who speak the truth are judged by those that have the power upon earth.</p>

<p>And leaving Jesus within the prætorium, Pilate went out to the Jews, and said to them:
I find no fault in him. The Jews say to him: He said, I can destroy this temple, and in three
days build it. Pilate says: What temple? The Jews say: The one that Solomon1820 built in
forty-six years, and this man speaks of pulling it down and building it in three days. Pilate
says to them: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. See you to it. The Jews say: His
blood be upon us, and upon our children.</p>
<p>And Pilate having summoned the elders and priests and Levites, said to them privately:
Do not act thus, because no charge that you bring against him is worthy of death; for your
charge is about curing and Sabbath profanation. The elders and the priests and the Levites
say: If any one speak evil against Cæsar, is he worthy of death or not? Pilate says: He is
worthy of death. The Jews say to Pilate: If any one speak evil against Cæsar, he is worthy
of death; but this man has spoken evil against God.</p>
<p>And the procurator ordered the Jews to go outside of the prætorium; and summoning
Jesus, he says to Him: What shall I do to thee? Jesus says to Pilate: As it has been given to
thee. Pilate says: How given? Jesus says: Moses and the prophets have proclaimed beforehand
of my death and resurrection. And the Jews noticing this, and hearing it, say to Pilate:
What more wilt thou hear of this blasphemy? Pilate says to the Jews: If these words be
blasphemous, do you take him for the blasphemy, and lead him away to your synagogue,
and judge him according to your law. The Jews say to Pilate: Our law bears that a man who
wrongs his fellow-men is worthy to receive forty save one; but he that blasphemeth God is
to be stoned with stones.1821</p>
<p>Pilate says to them: Do you take him, and punish him in whatever way you please. The
Jews say to Pilate: We wish that he be crucified. Pilate says: He is not deserving of crucifixion.</p>
<p>And the procurator, looking round upon the crowds of the Jews standing by, sees many
of the Jews weeping, and says: All the multitude do not wish him to die. The elders of the
Jews say: For this reason all the multitude of us have come, that he should die. Pilate says
to the Jews: Why should he die? The Jews say: Because he called himself Son of God, and
King.</p>

<p>And one Nicodemus, a Jew, stood before the procurator, and said: I beseech your
honour, let me say a few words. Pilate says: Say on. Nicodemus says: I said to the elders
and the priests and Levites, and to all the multitude of the Jews in the synagogue, What do
you seek to do with this man? This man does many miracles and strange things, which no
one has done or will do. Let him go, and do not wish any evil against him. If the miracles
which he does are of God, they will stand; but if man, they will come to nothing.1822 For
assuredly Moses, being sent by God into Egypt, did many miracles, which the Lord commanded
him to do before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And there were there Jannes and Jambres,
servants of Pharaoh, and they also did not a few of the miracles which Moses did; and the
Egyptians took them to be gods—this Jannes and this Jambres.1823 But, since the miracles
which they did were not of God, both they and those who believed in them were destroyed.
And now release this man, for he is not deserving of death.</p>
<p>The Jews say to Nicodemus: Thou hast become his disciple, and therefore thou defendest
him. Nicodemus says to them: Perhaps, too, the procurator has become his disciple, because
he defends him. Has the emperor not appointed him to this place of dignity? And the Jews
were vehemently enraged, and gnashed their teeth against Nicodemus. Pilate says to them:
Why do you gnash your teeth against him when you hear the truth? The Jews say to
Nicodemus: Mayst thou receive his truth and his portion. Nicodemus says: Amen, amen;
may I receive it, as you have said.</p>

<p>One of the Jews, stepping up, asked leave of the procurator to say a word. The procurator
says: If thou wishest to say any thing, say on. And the Jew said: Thirty-eight years I
lay in my bed in great agony. And when Jesus came, many demoniacs, and many lying ill
of various diseases, were cured by him. And some young men, taking pity on me, carried
me, bed and all, and took me to him. And when Jesus saw me, he had compassion on me,
and said to me: Take up thy couch and walk. And I took up my couch, and walked. The
Jews say to Pilate: Ask him on what day it was that he was cured. He that had been cured
says: On a Sabbath.1824 The Jews say: Is not this the very thing that we said, that on a
Sabbath he cures and casts out demons?</p>
<p>And another Jew stepped up and said: I was born blind; I heard sounds, but saw not a
face. And as Jesus passed by, I cried out with a loud voice, Pity me, O son of David. And
he pitied me, and put his hands upon my eyes, and I instantly received my sight.1825 And
another Jew stepped up and said: I was crooked, and he straightened me with a word. And

<p>And having summoned Nicodemus and the twelve men that said He was not born of
fornication, he says to them: What shall I do, because there is an insurrection among the
people? They say to him: We know not; let them see to it. Again Pilate, having summoned
all the multitude of the Jews, says: You know that it is customary, at the feast of unleavened
bread, to release one prisoner to you. I have one condemned prisoner in the prison, a
murderer named Barabbas, and this man standing in your presence, Jesus, in whom I find
no fault. Which of them do you wish me to release to you? And they cry out: Barabbas.
Pilate says: What, then, shall we do to Jesus who is called Christ? The Jews say: Let him
be crucified. And others said: Thou art no friend of Cæsar’s if thou release this man, because
he called himself Son of God and king. You wish, then, this man to be king, and not
Cæsar?1831</p>
<p>And Pilate, in a rage, says to the Jews: Always has your nation been rebellious, and you
always speak against your benefactors. The Jews say: What benefactors? He says to them:
Your God led you out of the land of Egypt from bitter slavery, and brought you safe through
the sea as through dry land, and in the desert fed you with manna, and gave you quails, and
quenched your thirst with water from a rock, and gave you a law; and in all these things you
provoked your God to anger, and sought a molten calf. And you exasperated your God,
and He sought to slay you. And Moses prayed for you, and you were not put to death. And
now you charge me with hating the emperor.1832</p>
<p>And rising up from the tribunal, he sought to go out. And the Jews cry out, and say:
We know that Cæsar is king, and not Jesus. For assuredly the magi brought gifts to him as
to a king. And when Herod heard from the magi that a king had been born, he sought to
slay him; and his father Joseph, knowing this, took him and his mother, and they fled into
Egypt. And Herod hearing of it, destroyed the children of the Hebrews that had been born
in Bethlehem.1833</p>
<p>And when Pilate heard these words, he was afraid; and ordering the crowd to keep silence,
because they were crying out, he said to them: So this is he whom Herod sought? The Jews
say: Yes, it is he. And, taking water, Pilate washed his hands in the face of the sun, saying:
I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see you to it. Again the Jews cry out: His blood
be upon us, and upon our children.</p>
<p>Then Pilate ordered the curtain of the tribunal where he was sitting to be drawn,1834

<head>Chapter 10.</head>
<p>And Jesus went forth out of the prætorium, and the two malefactors with Him. And
when they came to the place, they stripped Him of his clothes, and girded Him with a towel,
and put a crown of thorns on Him round His head. And they crucified Him; and at the
same time also they hung up the two malefactors along with Him. And Jesus said: Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do. And the soldiers parted His clothes among
them; and the people stood looking at Him. And the chief priests, and the rulers with them,
mocked Him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself. If he be the Son of God, let
him come down from the cross. And the soldiers made sport of Him, coming near and offering
Him vinegar mixed with gall, and said: Thou art the king of the Jews; save thyself.1835</p>
<p>And Pilate, after the sentence, ordered the charge made against Him to be inscribed as
a superscription in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, according to what the Jews had said: He
is king of the Jews.</p>
<p>And one of the malefactors hanging up spoke to Him, saying: If thou be the Christ,
save thyself and us. And Dysmas answering, reproved him, saying: Dost thou not fear God,
because thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the fit
punishment of our deeds; but this man has done no evil. And he said to Jesus: Remember
me, Lord, in Thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Amen, amen; I say to thee, To-day shalt
thou be1836 with me in Paradise.</p>

<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the earth until the ninth
hour, the sun being darkened; and the curtain of the temple was split in the middle. And
crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said: Father, Baddach ephkid ruel, which is, interpreted:
Into Thy hands I commit my spirit.1837 And having said this, He gave up the ghost. And
the centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified God, and said: This was a just man.
And all the crowds that were present at this spectacle, when they saw what had happened,
beat their breasts and went away.</p>
<p>And the centurion reported what had happened to the procurator. And when the procurator
and his wife heard it, they were exceedingly grieved, and neither ate nor drank that
day. And Pilate sent for the Jews, and said to them: Have you seen what has happened?</p>
<p>And they say: There has been an eclipse of the sun in the usual way.1838
And His acquaintances were standing at a distance, and the women who came with
Him from Galilee, seeing these things. And a man named Joseph, a councillor from the city
of Arimathæa, who also waited for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate, and begged the body
of Jesus. And he took it down, and wrapped it in clean linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn
out of the rock, in which no one had ever lain.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.</head>
<p>And the Jews, hearing that Joseph had begged the body of Jesus, sought him and the
twelve who said that Jesus was not born of fornication, and Nicodemus, and many others
who had stepped up before Pilate and declared His good works. And of all these that were
hid, Nicodemus alone was seen by them, because he was a ruler of the Jews. And Nicodemus
says to them: How have you come into the synagogue? The Jews say to him: How hast
thou come into the synagogue? for thou art a confederate of his, and his portion is with thee
in the world to come. Nicodemus says: Amen, amen. And likewise Joseph also stepped
out and said to them: Why are you angry against me because I begged the body of Jesus?
Behold, I have put him in my new tomb, wrapping him in clean linen; and I have rolled a
stone to the door of the tomb. And you have acted not well against the just man, because
you have not repented of crucifying him, but also have pierced him with a spear. And the
Jews seized Joseph, and ordered him to be secured until the first day of the week, and said
to him: Know that the time does not allow us to do anything against thee, because the
Sabbath is dawning; and know that thou shalt not be deemed worthy of burial, but we shall
give thy flesh to the birds of the air. Joseph says to them: These are the words of the arrogant
Goliath, who reproached the living God and holy David.1839 For God has said by the
prophet, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the Lord.1840 And now he that is uncircumcised
in flesh, but circumcised in heart, has taken water, and washed his hands in the
face of the sun, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. And you
answered and said to Pilate, His blood be upon us, and upon our children. And now I am
afraid lest the wrath of God come upon you, and upon your children, as you have said. And
the Jews, hearing these words, were embittered in their souls, and seized Joseph, and locked
him into a room where there was no window; and guards were stationed at the door, and
they sealed the door where Joseph was locked in.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath, the rulers of the synagogue,1841 and the priests and the Levites,
made a decree that all should be found in the synagogue on the first day of the week. And
rising up early, all the multitude in the synagogue consulted by what death they should slay
him. And when the Sanhedrin was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much indignity.
And having opened the door, they found him not. And all the people were surprised,
and struck with dismay, because they found the seals unbroken, and because Caiaphas had
the key. And they no longer dared to lay hands upon those who had spoken before Pilate
in Jesus’ behalf.</p>

<p>And while they were still sitting in the synagogue, and wondering about Joseph, there
come some of the guard whom the Jews had begged of Pilate to guard the tomb of Jesus,
that His disciples might not come and steal Him. And they reported to the rulers of the
synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, what had happened: how there had been a great
earthquake; and we saw an angel coming down from heaven, and he rolled away the stone
from the mouth of the tomb, and sat upon it; and he shone like snow, and like lightning.
And we were very much afraid, and lay like dead men; and we heard the voice of the angel
saying to the women who remained beside the tomb, Be not afraid, for I know that you seek
Jesus who was crucified. He is not here: He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where
the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and is in
Galilee.1842</p>
<p>The Jews say: To what women did he speak? The men of the guard say: We do not
know who they were. The Jews say: At what time was this? The men of the guard say: At
midnight. The Jews say: And wherefore did you not lay hold of them? The men of the
guard say: We were like dead men from fear, not expecting to see the light of day, and how
could we lay hold of them? The Jews say: As the Lord liveth, we do not believe you. The
men of the guard say to the Jews: You have seen so great miracles in the case of this man,
and have not believed; and how can you believe us? And assuredly you have done well to
swear that the Lord liveth, for indeed He does live. Again the men of the guard say: We
have heard that you have locked up the man that begged the body of Jesus, and put a seal
on the door; and that you have opened it, and not found him. Do you then give us the man
whom you were guarding, and we shall give you Jesus. The Jews say: Joseph has gone away
to his own city. The men of the guard say to the Jews: And Jesus has risen, as we heard
from the angel, and is in Galilee.</p>
<p>And when the Jews heard these words, they were very much afraid, and said: We must
take care lest this story be heard, and all incline to Jesus. And the Jews called a council, and
paid down a considerable sum of money, and gave it to the soldiers, saying: Say, while we
slept, his disciples came by night and stole him; and if this come to the ears of the procurator,
we shall persuade him, and keep you out of trouble. And they took it, and said as they had
been instructed.1843</p>
<note type="footnote">1842 Matt. xxviii. 5–7.</note>
<note type="footnote">1843 Three of the Latin versions say: And they took the money, but could not hide the truth. For they wanted
to say, His disciples stole him while we slept, and could not utter it; but said, Truly the Lord Jesus Christ has
risen from the dead; and we saw an angel of God coming down from heaven, and he rolled back the stone, and
sat on it. And this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews even to this day.</note>

<p>And Phinees a priest, and Adas a teacher, and Haggai a Levite, came down from Galilee
to Jerusalem, and said to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites: We
saw Jesus and his disciples sitting on the mountain called Mamilch;1844 and he said to his
disciples, Go into all the world, and preach to every creature: he that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be condemned. And these signs shall attend
those who have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons, speak new tongues, take
up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall
lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well. And while Jesus was speaking to his disciples,
we saw him taken up to heaven.1845</p>
<p>The elders and the priests and Levites say: Give glory to the God of Israel, and confess
to Him whether you have heard and seen those things of which you have given us an account.
And those who had given the account said: As the Lord liveth, the God of our fathers Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, we heard these things, and saw him taken up into heaven. The elders
and the priests and the Levites say to them: Have you come to give us this announcement,
or to offer prayer to God? And they say: To offer prayer to God. The elders and the chief
priests and the Levites say to them: If you have come to offer prayer to God, why then have
you told these idle tales in the presence of all the people?1846 Says Phinees the priest, and
Adas the teacher, and Haggai the Levite to the rulers of the synagogues, and the priests and
the Levites: If what we have said and seen be sinful, behold, we are before you; do to us as
seems good in your eyes. And they took the law, and made them swear upon it, not to give
any more an account of these matters to any one. And they gave them to eat and drink, and
sent them out of the city, having given them also money, and three men with them; and
they sent them away to Galilee. And these men having gone into Galilee, the chief priests,
and the rulers of the synagogue, and the elders, came together into the synagogue, and
locked the door, and lamented with a great lamentation, saying: Is this a miracle that has
happened in Israel? And Annas and Caiaphas said: Why are you so much moved? Why
do you weep? Do you not know that his disciples have given a sum of gold to the guards of
the tomb, and have instructed them to say that an angel came down and rolled away the
stone from the door of the tomb? And the priests and the elders said: Be it that his disciples
have stolen his body; how is it that the life has come into his body, and that he is going about
in Galilee? And they being unable to give an answer to these things, said, after great hesitation:
It is not lawful for us to believe the uncircumcised.</p>

<p>And Nicodemus stood up, and stood before the Sanhedrin, saying: You say well;1847
you are not ignorant, you people of the Lord, of these men that come down from Galilee,
that they fear God, and are men of substance, haters of covetousness, men of peace; and
they have declared with an oath, We saw Jesus upon the mountain Mamilch with his disciples,
and he taught what we heard from him, and we saw him taken up into heaven. And no one
asked them in what form he went up. For assuredly, as the book of the Holy Scriptures
taught us, Helias also was taken up into heaven, and Elissæus cried out with a loud voice,
and Helias threw his sheepskin upon Elissæus, and Elissæus threw his sheepskin upon the
Jordan, and crossed, and came into Jericho. And the children of the prophets met him, and
said, O Elissæus, where is thy master Helias? And he said, He has been taken up into
heaven. And they said to Elissæus, Has not a spirit seized him, and thrown him upon one
of the mountains? But let us take our servants1848 with us, and seek him. And they persuaded
Elissæus, and he went away with them. And they sought him three days, and did not find
him; and they knew he had been taken up.1849 And now listen to me, and let us send into
every district of Israel, and see lest perchance Christ has been taken up by a spirit, and
thrown upon one of the mountains? And this proposal pleased all. And they sent into every
district of Israel, and sought Jesus, and did not find Him; but they found Joseph in Arimathæa,
and no one dared to lay hands on him.</p>
<p>And they reported to the elders, and the priests, and the Levites: We have gone round
to every district of Israel, and have not found Jesus; but Joseph we have found in Arimathæa.
And hearing about Joseph, they were glad, and gave glory to the God of Israel. And the
rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, having held a council as to the
manner in which they should meet with Joseph, took a piece of paper, and wrote to Joseph
as follows:—</p>
<p>Peace to thee! We know that we have sinned against God, and against thee; and we
have prayed to the God of Israel, that thou shouldst deign to come to thy fathers, and to thy
children, because we have all been grieved. For having opened the door, we did not find
thee. And we know that we have counselled evil counsel against thee; but the Lord has defended
thee, and the Lord Himself has scattered to the winds our counsel against thee, O
honourable father Joseph.</p>
<p>And they chose from all Israel seven men, friends of Joseph, whom also Joseph himself
was acquainted with; and the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, say
to them: Take notice: if, after receiving our letter, he read it, know that he will come with

you to us; but if he do not read it, know that he is ill-disposed towards us. And having saluted
him in peace, return to us. And having blessed the men, they dismissed them. And the
men came to Joseph, and did reverence to him, and said to him: Peace to thee! And he
said: Peace to you, and to all the people of Israel! And they gave him the roll of the letter.
And Joseph having received it, read the letter and rolled it up, and blessed God, and said:
Blessed be the Lord God, who has delivered Israel, that they should not shed innocent blood;
and blessed be the Lord, who sent out His angel, and covered me under his wings. And he
set a table for them; and they ate and drank, and slept there. And they rose up early, and
prayed. And Joseph saddled his ass, and set out with the men; and they came to the holy
city Jerusalem. And all the people met Joseph, and cried out: Peace to thee in thy coming
in! And he said to all the people: Peace to you! and he kissed them. And the people prayed
with Joseph, and they were astonished at the sight of him. And Nicodemus received him
into his house, and made a great feast, and called Annas and Caiaphas, and the elders, and
the priests, and the Levites to his house. And they rejoiced, eating and drinking with Joseph;
and after singing hymns, each proceeded to his own house. But Joseph remained in the
house of Nicodemus.</p>
<p>And on the following day, which was the preparation, the rulers of the synagogue and
the priests and the Levites went early to the house of Nicodemus; and Nicodemus met them,
and said: Peace to you! And they said: Peace to thee, and to Joseph, and to all thy house,
and to all the house of Joseph! And he brought them into his house. And all the Sanhedrin
sat down, and Joseph sat down between Annas and Caiaphas: and no one dared to say a
word to him. And Joseph said: Why have you called me? And they signalled to Nicodemus
to speak to Joseph. And Nicodemus, opening his mouth, said to Joseph: Father, thou
knowest that the honourable teachers, and the priests and the Levites, see to learn a word
from thee. And Joseph said: Ask. And Annas and Caiaphas having taken the law, made
Joseph swear, saying: Give glory to the God of Israel, and give Him confession; for Achar
being made to swear by the prophet Jesus,1850 did not forsware himself, but declared unto
him all, and did not hide a word from him. Do thou also accordingly not hide from us to
the extent of a word. And Joseph said: I shall not hide from you one word. And they said
to him: With grief were we grieved because thou didst beg the body of Jesus, and wrap it
in clean linen, and lay it in a tomb. And on account of this we secured thee in a room where
there was no windows: and we put locks and seals upon the doors and guards kept watching
where thou wast locked in. And on the first day of the week we opened, and found thee
not, and were grieved exceedingly; and astonishment fell upon all the people of the Lord
until yesterday. And now relate to us what has happened to thee.</p>

<p>And Joseph said: On the preparation, about the tenth hour, you locked me up, and I
remained all the Sabbath. And at midnight, as I was standing and praying, the room where
you locked me in was hung up by the four corners, and I saw a light like lightning into my
eyes.1851 And I was afraid, and fell to the ground. And some one took me by the hand, and
removed me from the place where I had fallen; and moisture of water was poured from my
head even to my feet, and a smell of perfumes came about my nostrils. And he wiped my
face, and kissed me, and said to me, Fear not, Joseph; open thine eyes, and see who it is that
speaks to thee. And looking up, I saw Jesus. And I trembled and thought it was a phantom;
and I said the commandments, and he said them with me.1852 Even so you are not ignorant
that a phantom, if it meet anybody, and hear the commandments, takes to flight. And seeing
that he said them with me, I said to him, Rabbi Helias. And he said to me, I am not Helias.
And I said to him, Who art thou, my lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus, whose body thou
didst beg from Pilate; and thou didst clothe me with clean linen, and didst put a napkin on
my face, and didst lay me in thy new tomb, and didst roll a great stone to the door of the
tomb. And I said to him that was speaking to me, Show me the place where I laid thee.
And he carried me away, and showed me the place where I laid him; and the linen cloth was
lying in it, and the napkin for his face. And I knew that it was Jesus. And he took me by
the hand, and placed me, though the doors were locked, in the middle of my house, and led
me away to my bed, and said to me, Peace to thee! And he kissed me, and said to me, For
forty days go not forth out of thy house; for, behold, I go to my brethren into Galilee.</p>

<p>And the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, when they heard these
words from Joseph, became as dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour.
And Nicodemus, along with Joseph, exhorted Annas and Caiaphas, the priests and the
Levites, saying: Rise up and stand upon your feet, and taste bread, and strengthen your
souls, because to-morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord. And they rose up, and prayed to God,
and ate and drank, and departed every man to his own house.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath our teachers and the priests and Levites sat questioning each other,
and saying: What is this wrath that has come upon us? for we know his father and mother.
Levi, a teacher, says: I know that his parents fear God, and do not withdraw themselves
from the prayers, and give the tithes thrice a year.1853 And when Jesus was born, his parents
brought him to this place, and gave sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God. And when the
great teacher Symeon took him into his arms, he said, Now Thou sendest away Thy servant,
Lord, according to Thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou
hast prepared before the face of all the peoples: a light for the revelation of the Gentiles,
and the glory of Thy people Israel. And Symeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother,
I give thee good news about this child. And Mary said, It is well, my lord. And Symeon
said to her, It is well; behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a
sign spoken against; and of thee thyself a sword shall go through the soul, in order that the
reasoning of many hearts may be revealed.1854</p>
<p>They say to the teacher Levi: How knowest thou these things? Levi says to them: Do
you not know that from him I learned the law? The Sanhedrin say to him: We wish to see
thy father. And they sent for his father. And they asked him; and he said to them: Why
have you not believed my son? The blessed and just Symeon himself taught him the law.
The Sanhedrin says to Rabbi Levi: Is the word that you have said true? And he said: It is
true. And the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, said to themselves:
Come, let us send into Galilee to the three men that came and told about his teaching and
his taking up, and let them tell us how they saw him taken up. And this saying pleased all.
And they sent away the three men who had already gone away into Galilee with them; and
they say to them: Say to Rabbi Adas, and Rabbi Phinees, and Rabbi Haggai: Peace to you,
and all who are with you! A great inquiry having taken place in the Sanhedrin, we have
been sent to you to call you to this holy place, Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And the men set out into Galilee, and found them sitting and considering the law; and
they saluted them in peace. And the men who were in Galilee said to those who had come
<note type="footnote">1853 This would seem to confirm the opinion that there were three tithes paid in the year. Comp. Smith’s

to them: Peace upon all Israel! And they said: Peace to you! And they again said to them:
Why have you come? And those who had been sent said: The Sanhedrin call you to the
holy city Jerusalem. And when the men heard that they were sought by the Sanhedrin, they
prayed to God, and reclined with the men, and ate and drank, and rose up, and set out in
peace to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And on the following day the Sanhedrin sat in the synagogue, and asked them, saying:
Did you really see Jesus sitting on the mountain Mamilch teaching his eleven disciples, and
did you see him taken up? And the men answered them, and said: As we saw him taken
up, so also we said.</p>
<p>Annas says: Take them away from one another, and let us see whether their account
agrees. And they took them away from one another. And first they call Adas, and say to
him: How didst thou see Jesus taken up? Adas says: While he was yet sitting on the
mountain Mamilch, and teaching his disciples, we saw a cloud overshadowing both him
and his disciples. And the cloud took him up into heaven, and his disciples lay upon their
face upon the earth. And they call Phinees the priest, and ask him also, saying: How didst
thou see Jesus taken up? And he spoke in like manner. And they again asked Haggai, and
he spoke in like manner. And the Sanhedrin said: The law of Moses holds: At the mouth
of two or three every word shall be established.1855 Buthem, a teacher, says: It is written
in the law, And Enoch walked with God, and is not, because God took him.1856 Jairus, a
teacher, said: And the death of holy Moses we have heard of, and have not seen it; for it is
written in the law of the Lord, And Moses died from the mouth of the Lord, and no man
knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.1857 And Rabbi Levi said: Why did Rabbi Symeon
say, when he saw Jesus, “Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and
for a sign spoken against?”1858 And Rabbi Isaac said: It is written in the law, Behold, I send
my messenger before thy face, who shall go before thee to keep thee in every good way, because
my name has been called upon him.1859</p>
<p>Then Annas and Caiaphas said: Rightly have you said what is written in the law of
Moses, that no one saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the death of Moses; but
Jesus was tried before Pilate, and we saw him receiving blows and spittings on his face, and
the soldiers put about him a crown of thorns, and he was scourged, and received sentence
from Pilate, and was crucified upon the Cranium, and two robbers with him; and they gave
him to drink vinegar with gall, and Longinus the soldier pierced his side with a spear; and

Joseph our honourable father begged his body, and, as he says, he is risen; and as the three
teachers say, We saw him taken up into heaven; and Rabbi Levi has given evidence of what
was said by Rabbi Symeon, and that he said, Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of
many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against. And all the teachers said to all the people of
the Lord: If this was from the Lord, and is wonderful in your eyes,1860 knowing you shall
know, O house of Jacob, that it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth upon a tree.1861
And another Scripture teaches: The gods which have not made the heaven and the earth
shall be destroyed.1862 And the priests and the Levites said to each other: If his memorial
be until the year that is called Jobel,1863 know that it shall it endure for ever, and he hath
raised for himself a new people. Then the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the
Levites, announced to all Israel, saying: Cursed is that man who shall worship the work of
man’s hand, and cursed is the man who shall worship the creatures more than the Creator.

<p>A narrative about the suffering of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His holy resurrection.</p>
<p>Written by a Jew, Æneas by name, and translated out of the Hebrew tongue into the
Romaic language by Nicodemus, a Roman toparch.</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the kingdom of the Hebrews, four hundred years having run
their course, and the Hebrews also coming at last under the kingdom of the Romans, and
the king of the Romans appointing them a king; when Tiberius Cæsar at last swayed the
Roman sceptre, in the eighteenth year of his reign,1872 he appointed as king of Judæa, Herod,
the son of the Herod who had formerly slaughtered the infants in Bethlehem, and he made
Pilate procurator in Jerusalem; when Annas and Caiaphas held the high-priesthood of Jerusalem,
Nicodemus, a Roman toparch, having summoned a Jew, Æneas by name, asked
him to write an account of the things done in Jerusalem about Christ in the times of Annas
and Caiaphas. The Jew accordingly did this, and delivered it to Nicodemus; and he, again,
translated it from the Hebrew writing into the Romaic language. And the account is as
follows:—</p>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ having wrought in Judæa many and great and extraordinary
miracles, and on account of this being hated by the Hebrews, while Pilate was procurator
in Jerusalem, and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, there came of the Jews to the chief
priests, Judas, Levi, Nephthalim, Alexander, Syrus, and many others, speaking against Christ.
And these chief priests sent them away to say these things to Pilate also. And they went
away, and said to him: A man walks about in this city whose father is called Joseph, and his
mother Mary; and he calls himself king and Son of God; and being a Jew, he overturns the
Scriptures, and does away with the Sabbath. Pilate then asked, in order to learn from them
in what manner he did away with the Sabbath. And they answered, saying: He cures the
sick on the Sabbath. Pilate says: If he makes the sick whole, he does no evil. They say to
him: If he effected the cures properly, small would be the evil; but by using magic he does
these things, and by having the demons on his side. Pilate says: To cure a person that is ill
is not a diabolic work, but a grace from God.</p>
<p>The Hebrews said: We beseech your highness to summon him, in order that thou mayst
make accurate inquiry into what we say. Pilate therefore, throwing off his cloak, gave it to
one of his officers,1873 saying: Go away, and show this to Jesus, and say to him, Pilate the
procurator calls thee to come before him. The officer accordingly went away, and finding
Jesus, summoned Him, having unfolded on the ground also Pilate’s mantle, and urged Him
to walk upon it. And the Hebrews, seeing this, and being greatly enraged, came to Pilate,
murmuring against him, how he had deemed Jesus worthy of so great honour.</p>
<p>And he, having inquired of the officer who had been sent how he had done so, the officer
answered: When thou didst send me to the Jew Alexander, I came upon Jesus entering the
gate of the city, sitting upon an ass. And I saw that the Hebrews spread their garments in
the way, and the ass walked upon the garments; and others cut branches, and they went
forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna in the highest! Thus, therefore, it was necessary
for me also to do.</p>
<p>The Jews, hearing these words, said to him: How didst thou, being a Roman, know
what was said by the Hebrews? The officer answered: I asked one of the Hebrews, and he
told me these things. Pilate said: What means Hosanna? The Jews said: Save us, O Lord.
Pilate answered: Since you confess that your children said so, how now do you bring charges,
and say against Jesus what you do say? The Jews were silent, and had nothing to answer.1874</p>
<note type="footnote">1873 One ms. inserts: by name Rachaab, the messenger.</note>

specimen may be given:—And he went home to make a halter to hang himself, and he found his wife roasting

deserve. And his wife said to him: Why do you speak like that? And Judas says: Know in truth that I unjustly</note>

<p>Now, as Jesus was coming to Pilate, the soldiers of Pilate adored Him. And others also
were standing before Pilate holding standards. And as Jesus was coming, the standards also
bowed down, and adored Him. As Pilate, therefore, was wondering at what had happened,
the Jews said to him: My lord, it was not the standards that adored Jesus, but the soldiers
who were holding them carelessly.</p>
<p>Pilate says to the ruler of the synagogue: Choose twelve powerful men, and give them
the standards, so that they may hold them firmly. And this having taken place, Pilate ordered
the officer to take Jesus outside, and bring Him in again. And as He was coming in, the
standards again bowed down, and adored Him. Pilate therefore wondered greatly. But the
Jews said: He is a magician, and through that he does these things.</p>
<note type="footnote">betrayed my master, etc., and that he is going to rise on the third day; and woe to us! And his wife says: Do not
speak or think in that way. It is just as likely as that this cock roasting on the coals will crow, that Jesus will rise,
as you say. No sooner said than the cock flapped his wings, and crew thrice. This decided Judas, and he immediately
made the halter, and hanged himself. [Themss. of the “Second Greek Form” are designated by

<head>Chapter 2.</head>
<p>Pilate says to Jesus: Hearest thou what these testify against thee, and answerest thou
not?1875 And Jesus answered and said: Every man has power to speak either good or bad,
as he wishes; these also, therefore, having power, say what they wish.1876</p>
<p>The Jews said to Him: What have we to say about thee? First, that thou wast begotten
from sin; second, that on account of thee, when thou wast born, the infants1877 were
murdered; third, that thy father and thy mother fled into Egypt, because they had no confidence
in the people.</p>
<p>To these the Jews who were there present, God-fearing men, answered and said: We
say that his birth is not from sin; for we know that Joseph received into keeping his mother
Mary, according to the practice of betrothal. Pilate said: Consequently you lie who say that
his birth is from sin. They say again to Pilate: All the people testify that he is a magician.
The God-fearing Jews answered and said: We also were at the betrothal of his mother, and
we are Jews, and know all his daily life; but that he is a magician, that we do not know. And
the Jews that thus said were these: Lazarus, Astharius, Antonius, James, Zaras, Samuel,
Isaac, Phinees, Crispus, Dagrippus, Amese, and Judas.</p>
<p>Pilate therefore says to them: By the life of Cæsar, I wish you to swear whether the birth
of this man is without sin. They answered: Our law lays down that we are to swear not at
all, because an oath is great sin. Notwithstanding, by the life of Cæsar we swear that his
birth is without sin; and if we lie, order us all to be beheaded. And when they had thus
spoken, the Jews that were bringing the charge answered Pilate, and said: And dost thou
believe these twelve single Jews more than all the multitude and us, who know for certain
that he is a magician and blasphemer, and that he names himself Son of God?</p>
<p>Then Pilate ordered them all to go forth out of the prætorium except the said twelve
alone. And when this had been done, Pilate says to them privately: As to this man, it appears
that from envy and madness the Jews wish to murder him: for of one thing—that he does
away with the Sabbath—they accuse him; but he then does a good work, because he cures
the sick. For this, sentence of death is not upon the man. The twelve also say to him: Assuredly,
my lord, it is so.</p>

<p>Pilate therefore went outside in rage and anger, and says to Annas and Caiaphas, and
to the crowd who brought Jesus: I take the sun to witness that I find no fault in this man.
The crowd answered: If he were not a sorcerer, and a magician, and a blasphemer, we should
not have brought him to your highness. Pilate said: Try him yourselves; and since you have
a law, do as your law says. The Jews said: Our law permits to put no man to death.1878
Pilate says: If you are unwilling to put him to death, how much more am I!</p>
<p>Then Pilate returned to the palace, and says to Jesus: Tell me, art thou the king of the
Jews? Jesus answered: Dost thou say this, or have the other Jews said this to thee, that thou
mightst question me? Pilate said: Thou dost not think that I am a Hebrew? I am not a
Hebrew. Thy people and the chief priests have delivered thee into my hands; and tell me if
thou art king of the Jews? Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; for if my
kingdom were in this world, my soldiers would not be unconcerned at my being seized:
wherefore my kingdom is not in this world. Pilate says: But art thou a king? Jesus said:
Thou hast said: for this was I born, to bear witness to the truth; and if any one be a man of
the truth, he believes my word, and does it. Pilate says: What is the truth?1879 Jesus
answered: The truth is from the heavens. Pilate says: On earth, then, is there no truth?
Christ says: I am the truth; and how is the truth judged on earth by those that have earthly
power!</p>

<p>Pilate therefore, leaving Christ alone, went outside, and says to the Jews: I find no fault
in this man. The Jews answered: Let us tell your highness what he said. He said, I am able
to destroy the temple of God, and in three days to build it. Pilate says: And what temple
did he say that he was to destroy? The Hebrews say: The temple of Solomon, which Solomon
built in forty-six years.1880</p>
<p>Pilate says privately to the chief priests and the scribes and the Pharisees: I entreat you,
do nothing evil against this man; for if you do evil against him, you will do unjustly: for it
is not just that such a man should die, who has done great good to many men. They said
to Pilate: If, my lord, he who has dishonoured Cæsar is worthy of death, how much more
this man who dishonours God!</p>
<p>Then Pilate dismissed them, and they all went outside. Thereupon he says to Jesus:
What dost thou wish that I shall do to thee? Jesus says to Pilate: Do to me as is determined.
Pilate says: How is it determined? Jesus answered: Moses and the prophets wrote about
me being crucified, and rising again. The Hebrews, hearing this, said to Pilate: Why do you
seek to hear a greater insult out of him against God? Pilate says: These words are not an
insult against God, since they are written in the books of the prophets. The Hebrews said:
Our Scripture says, If a man offend against a man, that is to say, if he insult him, he is worthy
to receive forty strokes with a rod; but if any one insult God, to be stoned.1881</p>
<p>Then came a messenger from Procle, the wife of Pilate, to him; and the message said:
Take care that thou do not agree that any evil should happen to Jesus the good man; because
during this night I have seen fearful dreams on account of him.1882 And Pilate spoke to the
Hebrews, saying: If you hold as insult against God the words which you declare Jesus to
have spoken, take and judge him yourselves according to your law.1883 The Jews said to
Pilate: We wish that you should crucify him. Pilate says: This is not good.</p>
<p>And Pilate, turning towards the people, saw many weeping, and said: To me it seems
that it is not the wish of all the people that this man should die. The priests and the scribes
say: We on this account have brought all the people, that thou mightst have full conviction
that all wish his death. Pilate says: For what evil hath he done? The Hebrews said: He says
that he is a king, and the Son of God.</p>

<p>A God-fearing Jew, therefore, Nicodemus by name, stood up in the midst, and said to
Pilate: I entreat your highness to permit me to say a few words. Say on, said Pilate.
Nicodemus says: I, being present in the synagogue, said to the priests, and the Levites, and
the scribes, and the people, What have you to say against this man? This man does many
miracles, such as man has never yet done nor will do. Let him go, therefore; and if indeed
what he does be from God, it will stand; but if from man, it will be destroyed.1884 Just as
happened also when God sent Moses into Egypt, and Pharoah king of Egypt told him to do
a miracle, and he did it. Then Pharoah had also two magicians, Jannes and Jambres; and
they also did miracles by the use of magic art, but not such as Moses did.1885 And the
Egyptians held these magicians to be gods; but because they were not from God, what they
did was destroyed. This Jesus, then, raised up Lazarus, and he is alive. On this account I
entreat thee, my lord, by no means to allow this man to be put to death.</p>
<p>The Hebrews were enraged against Nicodemus, and said: Mayst thou receive the truth
of Jesus, and have a portion with him. Nicodemus says: Amen, amen; be it to me as you
say.</p>

<p>And when Nicodemus had thus spoken, another Hebrew rose up, and said to Pilate: I
beg of thee, my lord Pilate, hear me also. Pilate answered: Say what thou wishest. The
Hebrew says: I lay sick in bed thirty-eight years; and when he saw me he was grieved, and
said to me, Rise, take up thy couch, and go into thine house. And while he was saying the
word to me, I rose and walked about. The Hebrews say: Ask him on what day of the week
this happened. He says: On Sabbath.1886 The Jews said: And consequently we say truly,
that he does not keep the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Another, again, standing in the midst, said: I was born blind; and as Jesus was going
along the road, I cried to him, saying, Have mercy upon me, Lord, thou son of David. And
he took clay, and anointed mine eyes; and straightway I received my sight.1887 Another
said: I was crooked; and seeing him, I cried, Have mercy upon me, O Lord. And he took
me by the hand, and I was immediately raised.1888 Another said: I was a leper, and he
healed me merely by a word.1889</p>

<p>Other men cried: This man is a prophet, and the demons are afraid of him. Pilate says:
And how were the demons not at all thus afraid of your parents also? They say: We do not

a single word.1892 Pilate therefore, hearing of the raising of Lazarus, was afraid, and said
to the people: Why do you wish to shed the blood of a just man?</p>

<p>Then he summoned Nicodemus and the twelve God-fearing Jews, and said to them:
What do you say that I should do? because the people are in commotion. They say: We do
not know: do as thou wilt; but what the people do, they do unjustly, in order to kill him.
Pilate again went outside, and said to the people: You know that in the feasts of unleavened
bread it is customary that I free on your account one of the criminals kept in custody. I
have, then, one malefactor in the prison, a robber named Barabbas. I have also Jesus, who
has never done any evil. Which of the two, then, do you wish that I release to you? The
people answered: Release to us Barabbas. Pilate says: What then shall I do with Jesus?
They say: Let him be crucified.1893 Again, others of them cried out: If thou release Jesus,
thou art no friend of Cæsar,1894 because he calls himself Son of God, and king. And if thou
free him, he becomes a king, and will take Cæsar’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Pilate therefore was enraged, and said: Always has your nation been devilish1895 and
unbelieving; and ever have you been adversaries to your benefactors. The Hebrews say:
And who were our benefactors? Pilate says: God, who freed you out of the hand of Pharaoh,
and brought you through the Red Sea as upon dry land, and fed you with quails, and gave
you water to drink out of the dry rock, and who gave you a law which, denying God you
broke; and if Moses had not stood and entreated God, you would have perished by a bitter
death. All these, then, you have forgotten. Thus also, even now, you say that I do not at all
love Cæsar, but hate him, and wish to plot against his kingdom.</p>
<p>And having thus spoken, Pilate rose up from the throne with anger, wishing to flee from
them. The Jews therefore cried out, saying: We wish Cæsar to be king over us, not Jesus,
because Jesus received gifts1896 from the Magi. And Herod also heard this—that there was
going to be a king—and wished to put him to death, and for this purpose sent and put to
death all the infants that were in Bethlehem. And on this account also his father Joseph and
his mother fled from fear of him into Egypt.1897</p>
<p>So then Pilate, hearing this, silenced all the people, and said: This, then, is the Jesus
whom Herod then sought that he might put him to death? They say to him: Yes. Pilate
therefore, having ascertained that he was of the jurisdiction of Herod, as being derived of
the race of the Jews, sent Jesus to him. And Herod, seeing Him, rejoiced greatly, because

he had been long desiring to see Him, hearing of the miracles which He did. He put on
Him, therefore, white garments. Then he began to question Him. But Jesus did not give
him an answer. And Herod, wishing to see also some miracle or other done by Jesus, and
not seeing it, and also because He did not answer him a single word, sent Him back again
to Pilate.1898 Pilate, seeing this, ordered his officers to bring water. Washing, then, his
hands with the water, he said to the people: I am innocent of the blood of this good man.
See you to it, that he is unjustly put to death, since neither I have found a fault in him, nor
Herod; for because of this he has sent him back again to me. The Jews said: His blood be
upon us, and upon our children.1899</p>
<p>Then Pilate sat down upon his throne to pass sentence. He gave order, therefore, and
Jesus came before him. And they brought a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and a
reed into His right hand.1900 Then he passed sentence, and said to Him: Thy nation says,
and testifies against thee, that thou wishest to be a king. Therefore I decree that they shall
beat thee first with a rod forty strokes, as the laws of the kings decree, and that they shall
mock thee; and finally, that they shall crucify thee.</p>

<p>The sentence to this effect, then, having been passed by Pilate, the Jews began to strike
Jesus, some with rods, others with their hands, others with their feet; some also spat in His
face. Immediately, therefore, they got ready the cross, and gave it to Him, and flew to take
the road. And thus going along, bearing also the cross, He came as far as the gate of the city
of Jerusalem. But as He, from the many blows and the weight of the cross, was unable to
walk, the Jews, out of the eager desire they had to crucify Him as quickly as possible, took
the cross from Him, and gave it to a man that met them, Simon by name, who had also two
sons, Alexander and Rufus. And he was from the city of Cyrene.1901 They gave the cross,
then, to him, not because they pitied Jesus, and wished to lighten Him of the weight, but
because they eagerly desired, as has been said, to put Him to death more speedily.</p>
<p>Of His disciples, therefore, John followed Him there. Then he came fleeing to the
mother of God,1902 and said to her: Where hast thou been, that thou hast not come to see
what has happened? She answered: What is it that has happened? John says: Know that
the Jews have laid hold of my Master, and are taking Him away to crucify Him. Hearing
this, His mother cried out with a loud voice, saying: My son, my son, what evil then hast
thou done, that1903 they are taking thee away to crucify thee? And she rose up as if
blinded,1904 and goes along the road weeping. And women followed her—Martha, and
Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other virgins. And John also was with her. When,
therefore, they came to the multitude of the crowd, the mother of God says to John: Where
is my son? John says: Seest thou Him bearing the crown of thorns, and having His hands
bound? And the mother of God, hearing this, and seeing Him, fainted, and fell backwards
to the ground, and lay a considerable time. And the women, as many as followed her, stood
round her, and wept. And as soon as she revived and rose up, she cried out with a loud
voice: My Lord, my son, where has the beauty of thy form sunk? how shall I endure to see
thee suffering such things? And thus saying, she tore her face with her nails, and beat her
breast. Where are they gone, said she, the good deeds which thou didst in Judæa? What
evil hast thou done to the Jews? The Jews, then, seeing her thus lamenting and crying, came
and drove her from the road; but she would not flee, but remained, saying: Kill me first, ye
lawless Jews.</p>

there the Jews set up the cross. Then they stripped Jesus, and the soldiers took His garments,
and divided them among themselves; and they put on Him a tattered robe of scarlet, and
raised Him, and drew Him up on the cross at the sixth hour of the day. After this they
brought also two robbers, the one on His right, the other on His left.</p>
<p>Then the mother of God, standing and looking, cried out with a loud voice, saying: My
son! my son! And Jesus, turning to her, and seeing John near her, and weeping with the
rest of the women, said: Behold thy son! Then He says also to John: Behold thy mother!1906
And she wept much, saying: For this I weep, my son, because thou sufferest unjustly, because
the lawless Jews have delivered thee to a bitter death. Without thee, my son, what will become
of me? How shall I live without thee? What sort of life shall I spend? Where are thy disciples,
who boasted that they would die with thee? Where those healed by thee? How has no one
been found to help thee? And looking to the cross, she said: Bend down, O cross, that I
may embrace and kiss my son, whom I suckled at these breasts after a strange manner, as
not having known man. Bend down, O cross; I wish to throw my arms round my son. Bend
down, O cross, that I may bid farewell to my son like a mother. The Jews, hearing these
words, came forward, and drove to a distance both her and the women and John.</p>
<p>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Father, let not this sin stand against
them; for they know not what they do.1907 Then He says: I thirst. And immediately there
ran one of the soldiers, and took a sponge, and filled it with gall and vinegar mixed, and put
it on a reed, and gave Jesus to drink. And having tasted it, He would not drink it.1908 And
the Jews standing and looking on laughed at Him, and said: If thou truly sayst that thou art
the Son of God, come down from the cross, and immediately, that we may believe in thee.
Others said mocking: Others he saved, others he cured, and he healed the sick, the paralytic,
the lepers, the demoniacs, the blind, the lame, the dead; and himself he cannot cure.1909</p>
<p>In the same manner also, the robber crucified on His left hand said to Him: If thou art
the Son of God, come down and save both thyself and us. His name was Gistas. And he
that was crucified on the right, Dysmas by name, reproved that robber, saying: O wretched
and miserable man, dost thou not fear God? We suffer the due punishment of what we
have done; but this man has done no evil at all. And turning to Jesus, he says to Him: Lord,
when Thou shalt reign do not forget me. And He said to him: To-day, I tell thee truth, I
shall have thee in paradise with me.1910</p>

<p>Then Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, Father, into Thy hands I shall commit my
spirit, breathed His last.1911 And immediately one could see the rocks rent: for there was
an earthquake over all the earth; and from the earthquake being violent and great, the rocks
also were rent. And the tombs of the dead were opened, and the curtain of the temple was
rent, and there was darkness from the sixth hour till the ninth. And from all these things
that had happened the Jews were afraid, and said: Certainly this was a just man. And
Longinus, the centurion who stood by, said: Truly this was a son of God. Others coming
and seeing Him, beat their breasts from fear, and again turned back.1912</p>
<p>And the centurion having perceived all these so great miracles, went away and reported
them to Pilate. And when he heard, he wondered and was astonished, and from his fear
and grief would neither eat nor drink that day. And he sent notice, and all the Sanhedrin
came to him as soon as the darkness was past; and he said to the people: You know how
the sun has been darkened; you know how the curtain has been rent. Certainly I did well
in being by no means willing to put to death the good man. And the malefactors said to
Pilate: This darkness is an eclipse of the sun, such as has happened also at other times.
Then they say to him: We hold the feast of unleavened bread to-morrow; and we entreat
thee, since the crucified are still breathing, that their bones be broken, and that they be
brought down. Pilate said: It shall be so. He therefore sent soldiers, and they found the
two robbers yet breathing, and they broke their legs; but finding Jesus dead, they did not
touch Him at all, except that a soldier speared Him in the right side, and immediately there
came forth blood and water.1913</p>
<p>And as the day of the preparation1914 was drawing towards evening, Joseph, a man wellborn
and rich, a God-fearing Jew, finding Nicodemus, whose sentiments his foregoing
speech had shown, says to him: I know that thou didst love Jesus when living, and didst
gladly hear his words, and I saw thee fighting with the Jews on his account. If, then, it seem
good to thee, let us go to Pilate, and beg the body of Jesus for burial, because it is a great sin
for him to lie unburied. I am afraid, said Nicodemus, lest Pilate should be enraged, and
some evil should befall me. But if thou wilt go alone, and beg the dead, and take him, then
will I also go with thee, and help thee to do everything necessary for the burial. Nicodemus
having thus spoken, Joseph directed his eyes to heaven, and prayed that he might not fail
in his request; and he went away to Pilate, and having saluted him, sat down. Then he says
to him: I entreat thee, my lord, not to be angry with me, if I shall ask anything contrary to

what seems good to your highness. And he said: And what is it that thou askest? Joseph
says: Jesus, the good man whom through hatred the Jews have taken away to crucify, him
I entreat that thou give me for burial. Pilate says: And what has happened, that we should
deliver to be honoured again the dead body of him against whom evidence of sorcery was
brought by his nation, and who was in suspicion of taking the kingdom of Cæsar, and so
was given up by us to death? And Joseph, weeping and in great grief, fell at the feet of Pilate,
saying: My lord, let no hatred fall upon a dead man; for all the evil that a man has done
should perish with him in his death. And I know your highness, how eager thou wast that
Jesus should not be crucified, and how much thou saidst to the Jews on his behalf, now in
entreaty and again in anger, and at last how thou didst wash thy hands, and declare that
thou wouldst by no means take part with those who wished him to be put to death; for all
which reasons I entreat thee not to refuse my request. Pilate, therefore, seeing Joseph thus
lying, and supplicating, and weeping, raised him up, and said: Go, I grant thee this dead
man; take him, and do whatever thou wilt.</p>
<p>And then Joseph, having thanked Pilate, and kissed his hands and his garments, went
forth, rejoicing indeed in heart as having obtained his desire, but carrying tears in his eyes.
Thus also, though grieved, he was glad. Accordingly he goes away to Nicodemus, and discloses
to him all that had happened. Then, having bought myrrh and aloes a hundred
pounds, and a new tomb,1915 they, along with the mother of God and Mary Magdalene and
Salome, along with John, and the rest of the women, did what was customary for the body
with white linen, and placed it in the tomb.1916</p>
<p>And the mother of God said, weeping: How am I not to lament thee, my son? How
should I not tear my face with my nails? This is that, my son, which Symeon the elder
foretold to me when I brought thee, an infant of forty days old, into the temple. This is the
sword which now goes through my soul.1917 Who shall put a stop to my tears, my sweetest
son? No one at all except thyself alone, if, as thou saidst, thou shalt rise again in three days.</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene said, weeping: Hear, O peoples, tribes, and tongues, and learn to what
death the lawless Jews have delivered him who did them ten thousand good deeds. Hear,
and be astonished. Who will let these things be heard by all the world? I shall go alone to
Rome, to the Cæsar. I shall show him what evil Pilate hath done in obeying the lawless
Jews. Likewise also, Joseph lamented, saying: Ah, me! sweetest Jesus, most excellent of
men, if indeed it be proper to call thee man, who hast wrought such miracles as no man has
ever done. How shall I enshroud thee? How shall I entomb thee? There should now have

been here those whom thou fedst with a few loaves; for thus should I not have seemed to
fail in what is due.</p>
<p>Then Joseph, along with Nicodemus, went home; and likewise also the mother of God,
with the women, John1918 also being present with them.
1918 It is to be observed that John’s Gospel is much more frequently quoted in this book than any of the
others.</p>

<p>When the Jews were made acquainted with these things done by Joseph and Nicodemus,
they were greatly stirred up against them. And the chief priests Annas and Caiaphas sent
for Joseph, and said: Why hast thou done this service to Jesus? Joseph says: I know that
Jesus was a man just, and true, and good in all respects; and I know also that you, through
hatred, managed to murder him: and therefore I buried him. Then the high priests were
enraged, and laid hold of Joseph, and threw him into prison, and said to him: If we had not
to-morrow the feast of unleavened bread, tomorrow also should we have put thee, like him,
to death; but being kept in the meantime, early in the morning of the Lord’s day1919 thou
shalt be given up to death. Thus they spoke, and affixed their seal to the prison, having secured
it by fastenings of all sorts.</p>
<p>Thus, therefore, when the Preparation was ended, early on the Sabbath the Jews went
away to Pilate, and said to him: My lord, that deceiver said, that after three days he should
rise again. Lest, therefore, his disciples should steal him by night, and lead the people astray
by such deceit, order his tomb to be guarded. Pilate therefore, upon this, gave them five
hundred soldiers, who also sat round the sepulchre so as to guard it, after having put seals
upon the stone of the tomb.1920</p>
<p>The Lord’s day, then, having dawned, the chief priests, along with the Jews, called a
council, and sent to take Joseph out of the prison, in order to put him to death. But having
opened it, they found him not. And they were astonished at this—how, with the doors shut,
and the bolts safe, and the seals unbroken, Joseph had disappeared.</p>

<p>And upon this there came up one of the soldiers guarding the tomb, and he said in the
synagogue: Learn that Jesus has risen. The Jews say: How? And he said: First there was
an earthquake; then an angel of the Lord, clothed with lightning, came from heaven, and
rolled the stone from the tomb, and sat upon it. And from fear of him, all of us soldiers
became as dead, and were able neither to flee nor speak. And we heard the angels saying
to the women who came there to see the tomb: Be not you afraid, for I know that you seek
Jesus. He is not here, but is risen, as He told you before. Bend down and see the tomb where
His body lay; but go and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and let them go
into Galilee, for there shall they find Him. For this reason I tell you this first.1921</p>
<p>The Jews say to the soldiers: What sort of women were they who came to the tomb?
and why did you not lay hold of them? The soldiers say: From the fear and the mere sight
of the angel, we were able neither to speak nor move. The Jews said: As the God of Israel
liveth, we do not believe a word you say. The soldiers say: Jesus did so great wonders, and
you believed not, and are you going to believe us? You say truly that God liveth; and certainly
he whom you crucified truly liveth. But we have heard that you had Joseph shut up in the
prison, and that you afterwards opened the doors, and did not find him. Do you then present
Joseph, and so we also shall present Jesus. The Jews say: Joseph, that fled from the prison,
you will find in Arimathæa, his own country. And the soldiers say: Go you too into Galilee,
and you will find Jesus, as the angel said to the women.</p>
<p>At these words the Jews were afraid, and said to the soldiers: See that you tell this story
to nobody, or all will believe in Jesus. And for this reason they gave them also much money.
And the soldiers said: We are afraid lest by any chance Pilate hear that we have taken money,
and he will kill us. And the Jews said: Take it; and we pledge ourselves that we shall speak
to Pilate in your defence. Only say that you were asleep, and in your slumber the disciples
of Jesus came and stole him from the tomb. The soldiers therefore took the money, and
said as they were bid. And up to this day this same lying tale is told among the Jews.1922</p>

<p>And a few days after there came from Galilee to Jerusalem three men. One of them was
a priest, by name Phinees; the second a Levite, by name Aggai; and the third a soldier, by
name Adas. These came to the chief priests, and said to them and to the people: Jesus,
whom you crucified, we have seen in Galilee with his eleven disciples upon the Mount of
Olives, teaching them, and saying, Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news; and
whosoever will believe and be baptized shall be saved; but whosoever will not believe shall
be condemned. And having thus spoken, he went up into heaven.1923 And both we and
many others of the five hundred1924 besides were looking on.</p>
<p>And when the chief priests and the Jews heard these things, they said to these three:
Give glory to the God of Israel, and repent of these lies that you have told. They answered:
As the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob liveth, we do not lie, but tell you the
truth. Then the high priest spoke, and they brought the old covenant of the Hebrews out
of the temple, and he made them swear, and giving them also money, he sent them into
another place, in order that they might not proclaim in Jerusalem the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>And when these stories had been heard by all the people, the crowd came together into
the temple, and there was a great commotion. For many said: Jesus has risen from the dead,
as we hear, and why did you crucify him? And Annas and Caiaphas said: Do not believe,
ye Jews, what the soldiers say; and do not believe that they saw an angel coming down from
heaven. For we have given money to the soldiers, in order that they should not tell such
tales to any one; and thus also have the disciples of Jesus given them money, in order that
they should say that Jesus has risen from the dead.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.</head>
<p>Nicodemus says: O children of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the prophet Helias went
up into the height of heaven with a fiery chariot, and it is nothing incredible if Jesus too has
risen; for the prophet Helias was a prototype of Jesus, in order that you, hearing that Jesus
has risen, might not disbelieve. I therefore say and advise, that it is befitting that we send
soldiers into Galilee, to that place where these men testify that they saw him with his disciples,
in order that they may go round about and find him, and that thus we may ask pardon of
him for the evil which we have done to him. This proposal pleased them; and they chose
soldiers, and sent them away into Galilee. And Jesus indeed they did not find; but they
found Joseph in Arimathæa.</p>
<p>When, therefore, the soldiers had returned, the chief priests, having ascertained that
Joseph was found, brought the people together, and said: What shall we do to get Joseph
to come to us? After deliberating, therefore, they wrote to him a letter to the following effect:—
O father Joseph, peace be to thee and all thy house, and thy friends! We know that
we have offended against God, and against thee His servant. On account of this, we entreat
thee to come here to us thy children. For we have wondered much how thou didst escape
from the prison, and we say in truth that we had an evil design against thee. But God, seeing
that our designs against thee were unjust, has delivered thee out of our hands. But come to
us, for thou art the honour of our people.</p>
<p>This letter the Jews sent to Arimathæa, with seven soldiers, friends of Joseph. And they
went away and found him; and having respectfully saluted him, as they had been ordered,
they gave him the letter. And after receiving it and reading it, he glorified God, and embraced
the soldiers; and having set a table, ate and drank with them during all the day and the night.</p>
<p>And on the following day he set out with them to Jerusalem; and the people came forth
to meet him, and embraced him. And Nicodemus received him into his own house. And
the day after, Annas and Caiaphas, the chief priests, having summoned him to the temple,
said to him: Give glory to the God of Israel, and tell us the truth. For we know that thou
didst bury Jesus; and on this account we laid hold of thee, and locked thee up in the prison.
Thereafter, when we sought to bring thee out to be put to death, we did not find thee, and
we were greatly astonished and afraid. Moreover, we prayed to God that we might find
thee, and ask thee. Tell us therefore the truth.</p>
<p>Joseph said to them: In the evening of the Preparation, when you secured me in prison,
I fell a-praying throughout the whole night, and throughout the whole day of the Sabbath.
And at midnight I see the prison-house that four angels lifted it up,1925 holding it by the
four corners. And Jesus came in like lightning, and I fell to the ground from fear. Taking
hold of me, therefore, by the hand, he raised me, saying, Fear not, Joseph. Thereafter, em-

bracing me, he kissed me, and said, Turn thyself, and see who I am. Turning myself,
therefore, and looking, I said, My lord, I know not who thou art. He says, I am Jesus, whom
thou didst bury the day before yesterday. I say to him, Show me the tomb, and then I shall
believe. He took me, therefore, by the hand, and led me away to the tomb, which had been
opened. And seeing the linen and the napkin, and recognising him, I said, Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord;1926 and I adored him. Then taking me by the hand, and
accompanied by the angels, he brought me to my house in Arimathæa, and said to me, Sit
here for forty days; for I go to my disciples, in order that I may enable them fully to proclaim
my resurrection.</p>

<p>When Joseph had thus spoken, the chief priests cried out to the people: We know that
Jesus had a father and mother; how can we believe that he is the Christ? One of the Levites
answered and said: I know the family of Jesus, noble-minded men,1927 great servants of
God, and receiving tithes from the people of the Jews. And I know also Symeon the elder,
that he received him when he was an infant, and said to him: Now thou sendest away Thy
servant, O Lord.</p>
<p>The Jews said: Let us now find the three men that saw him on the Mount of Olives, that
we may question them, and learn the truth more accurately. They found them, and brought
them before all, and made them swear to tell the truth. And they said: As the God of Israel
liveth, we saw Jesus alive on the Mount of Olives, and going up into heaven.</p>
<p>Then Annas and Caiaphas took the three apart, one by one, and questioned them singly
in private. They agreed with one another, therefore, and gave, even the three, one account.
The chief priests answered, saying: Our Scripture says that every word shall be established
by two or three witnesses.1928 Joseph, then, has confessed that he, along with Nicodemus,
attended to his body, and buried him, and how it is the truth that he has risen.1929</p>

<p>Joseph says: And why do you wonder that Jesus has risen? But it is wonderful that He
has not risen alone, but that He has also raised many others of the dead who have appeared
in Jerusalem to many.1930 And if you do not know the others, Symeon at least, who received
Jesus, and his two sons whom He has raised up—them at least you know. For we buried
them not long ago; but now their tombs are seen open and empty, and they are alive, and
dwelling in Arimathæa. They therefore sent men, and they found their tombs open and
empty. Joseph says: Let us go to Arimathæa and find them.</p>
<p>Then rose up the chief priests Annas and Caiaphas, and Joseph, and Nicodemus, and
Gamaliel, and others with them, and went away to Arimathæa, and found those whom
Joseph spoke of. They made prayer, therefore, and saluted each other. Then they came
with them to Jerusalem, and brought them into the synagogue, and secured the doors, and
placed in the midst the old covenant of the Jews; and the chief priests said to them: We wish
you to swear by the God of Israel and Adonai, and so that you tell the truth, how you have
risen, and who has raised you from the dead.</p>
<p>The men who had risen having heard this, made upon their faces the sign of the cross,
and said to the chief priests: Give us paper and ink and pen. These therefore they brought.

<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrection and the life of the world, grant us grace that we
may give an account of Thy resurrection, and Thy miracles which Thou didst in Hades.
We then were in Hades, with all who had fallen asleep since the beginning of the world.
And at the hour of midnight there rose a light as if of the sun, and shone into these dark
regions; and we were all lighted up, and saw each other. And straightway our father Abraham
was united with the patriarchs and the prophets, and at the same time they were filled with
joy, and said to each other: This light is from a great source of light. The prophet Hesaias,
who was there present, said: This light is from the Father, and from the Son, and from the
Holy Spirit; about whom I prophesied when yet alive, saying, The land of Zabulon, and the
land of Nephthalim, the people that sat in darkness, have seen a great light.1931
Then there came into the midst another, an ascetic from the desert; and the patriarchs
said to him: Who art thou? And he said: I am John, the last of the prophets, who made
the paths of the Son of God straight,1932 and proclaimed to the people repentance for the
remission of sins.1933 And the Son of God came to me; and I, seeing Him a long way off,
said to the people: Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.1934 And
with my hand I baptized Him in the river Jordan, and I saw like a dove also the Holy Spirit
coming upon Him;1935 and I heard also the voice of God, even the Father,1936 thus saying:
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.1937 And on this account He sent me
also to you, to proclaim how the only begotten Son of God is coming here, that whosoever
shall believe in Him shall be saved, and whosoever shall not believe in Him shall be condemned.
1938 On this account I say to you all, in order that when you see Him you all may
adore Him, that now only is for you the time of repentance for having adored idols in the
vain upper world, and for the sins you have committed, and that this is impossible at any
other time.</p>

<p>While John, therefore, was thus teaching those in Hades, the first created and forefather
Adam heard, and said to his son Seth: My son, I wish thee to tell the forefathers of the race
of men and the prophets where I sent thee, when it fell to my lot to die. And Seth said:
Prophets and patriarchs, hear. When my father Adam, the first created, was about to fall
once upon a time into death, he sent me to make entreaty to God very close by the gate of
paradise, that He would guide me by an angel to the tree of compassion and that I might
take oil and anoint my father, and that he might rise up from his sickness: which thing,
therefore, I also did. And after the prayer an angel of the Lord came, and said to me: What,
Seth, dost thou ask? Dost thou ask oil which raiseth up the sick, or the tree from which this
oil flows, on account of the sickness of thy father? This is not to be found now. Go, therefore,
and tell thy father, that after the accomplishing of five thousand five hundred years1939 from
the creation of the world, then shalt come into the earth the only begotten Son of God, being
made man; and He shall anoint him with this oil, and shall raise him up; and shall wash
clean, with water and with the Holy Spirit, both him and those out of him, and then shall

<head>Chapter 4 (20).</head>
<p>And when all were in such joy, came Satan the heir of darkness, and said to Hades: O
all-devouring and insatiable, hear my words. There is of the race of the Jews one named
Jesus, calling himself the Son of God; and being a man, by our working with them the Jews
have crucified him: and now when he is dead, be ready that we may secure him here. For
I know that he is a man, and I heard him also saying, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death.1941 He has also done me many evils when living with mortals in the upper
world. For wherever he found my servants, he persecuted them; and whatever men I made
crooked, blind, lame, lepers, or any such thing, by a single word he healed them; and many
whom I had got ready to be buried, even these through a single word he brought to life
again.</p>
<p>Hades says: And is this man so powerful as to do such things by a single word? or if he
be so, canst thou withstand him? It seems to me that, if he be so, no one will be able to
withstand him. And if thou sayest that thou didst hear him dreading death, he said this
mocking thee, and laughing, wishing to seize thee with the strong hand; and woe, woe to
thee, to all eternity!</p>
<p>Satan says: O all-devouring and insatiable Hades, art thou so afraid at hearing of our
common enemy? I was not afraid of him, but worked in the Jews, and they crucified him,
and gave him also to drink gall with vinegar.1942 Make ready, then, in order that you may
lay fast hold of him when he comes.</p>
<p>Hades answered: Heir of darkness, son of destruction, devil, thou hast just now told
me that many whom thou hadst made ready to be buried, be brought to life again by a single
word. And if he has delivered others from the tomb, how and with what power shall he be
laid hold of by us? For I not long ago swallowed down one dead, Lazarus by name; and not
long after, one of the living by a single word dragged him up by force out of my bowels:
and I think that it was he of whom thou speakest. If, therefore, we receive him here, I am
afraid lest perchance we be in danger even about the rest. For, lo, all those that I have
swallowed from eternity I perceive to be in commotion, and I am pained in my belly. And
the snatching away of Lazarus beforehand seems to me to be no good sign: for not like a
dead body, but like an eagle, he flew out of me; for so suddenly did the earth throw him out.
Wherefore also I adjure even thee, for thy benefit and for mine, not to bring him here; for
I think that he is coming here to raise all the dead. And this I tell thee: by the darkness in
which we live, if thou bring him here, not one of the dead will be left behind in it to me.</p>

<p>While Satan and Hades were thus speaking to each other, there was a great voice like
thunder, saying: Lift up your gates, O ye rulers; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and
the King of glory shall come in.1943 When Hades heard, he said to Satan: Go forth, if thou
art able, and withstand him. Satan therefore went forth to the outside. Then Hades says to
his demons: Secure well and strongly the gates of brass and the bars of iron, and attend to
my bolts, and stand in order,1944 and see to everything; for if he come in here, woe will seize
us.</p>
<p>The forefathers having heard this, began all to revile him, saying: O all-devouring and
insatiable! open, that the King of glory may come in. David the prophet says: Dost thou
not know, O blind, that I when living in the world prophesied this saying: Lift up your gates,
O ye rulers? Hesaias said: I, foreseeing this by the Holy Spirit, wrote: The dead shall rise
up, and those in their tombs shall be raised, and those in the earth shall rejoice.1945 And
where, O death, is thy sting? where, O Hades, is thy victory?1946</p>
<p>There came, then, again a voice saying: Lift up the gates. Hades, hearing the voice the
second time, answered as if forsooth he did not know, and says: Who is this King of glory?
The angels of the Lord say: The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.1947
And immediately with these words the brazen gates were shattered, and the iron bars broken,
and all the dead who had been bound came out of the prisons, and we with them. And the
King of glory came in in the form of a man, and all the dark places of Hades were lighted
up.</p>

<p>Immediately Hades cried out: We have been conquered: woe to us! But who art thou,
that hast such power and might? and what art thou, who comest here without sin who art
seen to be small and yet of great power, lowly and exalted, the slave and the master, the
soldier and the king, who hast power over the dead and the living? Thou wast nailed on the
cross, and placed in the tomb; and now thou art free, and hast destroyed all our power. Art
thou then the Jesus about whom the chief satrap Satan told us, that through cross and death
thou art to inherit the whole world?</p>
<p>Then the King of glory seized the chief satrap Satan by the head, and delivered him to
His angels, and said: With iron chains bind his hands and his feet, and his neck, and his
mouth. Then He delivered him to Hades, and said: Take him, and keep him secure till my

be crucified, so that he should come here and deprive us of our power? Turn and see that
not one of the dead has been left in me, but all that thou hast gained through the tree of
knowledge, all hast thou lost through the tree of the cross: and all thy joy has been turned
into grief; and wishing to put to death the King of glory, thou hast put thyself to death. For,
since I have received thee to keep thee safe, by experience shalt thou learn how many evils
I shall do unto thee. O arch-devil, the beginning of death, root of sin, end of all evil, what
evil didst thou find in Jesus, that thou shouldst compass his destruction? how hast thou
dared to do such evil? how hast thou busied thyself to bring down such a man into this
darkness, through whom thou hast been deprived of all who have died from eternity?</p>

<p>While Hades was thus discoursing to Satan, the King of glory stretched out His right
hand, and took hold of our forefather Adam, and raised him. Then turning also to the rest,
He said: Come all with me, as many as have died through the tree which he touched: for,
behold, I again raise you all up through the tree of the cross. Thereupon He brought them
all out, and our forefather Adam seemed to be filled with joy, and said: I thank Thy majesty,
O Lord, that Thou hast brought me up out of the lowest Hades.1948 Likewise also all the
prophets and the saints said: We thank Thee, O Christ, Saviour of the world, that Thou
hast brought our life up out of destruction.1949</p>
<p>And after they had thus spoken, the Saviour blessed Adam with the sign of the cross on

<p>And setting out to paradise, He took hold of our forefather Adam by the hand, and delivered
him, and all the just, to the archangel Michael. And as they were going into the door
of paradise, there met them two old men, to whom the holy fathers said: Who are you, who
have not seen death, and have not come down into Hades, but who dwell in paradise in
your bodies and your souls? One of them answered, and said: I am Enoch, who was wellpleasing
to God, and who was translated hither by Him; and this is Helias the Thesbite; and
we are also to live until the end of the world; and then we are to be sent by God to withstand
Antichrist, and to be slain by him, and after three days to rise again, and to be snatched up
in clouds to meet the Lord.1951</p>

<p>While they were thus speaking, there came another lowly man, carrying also upon his
shoulders a cross, to whom the holy fathers said: Who art thou, who hast the look of a
robber; and what is the cross which thou bearest upon thy shoulders? He answered: I, as
you say, was a robber and a thief in the world, and for these things the Jews laid hold of me,
and delivered me to the death of the cross, along with our Lord Jesus Christ. While, then,
He was hanging upon the cross, I, seeing the miracles that were done, believed in Him, and
entreated Him, and said, Lord, when Thou shalt be King, do not forget me. And immediately
He said to me, Amen, amen: to-day, I say unto thee, shalt thou be with me in paradise.
Therefore I came to paradise carrying my cross; and finding the archangel Michael, I said
to him, Our Lord Jesus, who has been crucified, has sent me here; bring me, therefore, to
the gate of Eden. And the flaming sword, seeing the sign of the cross, opened to me, and I
went in. Then the archangel says to me, Wait a little, for there cometh also the forefather
of the race of men, Adam, with the just, that they too may come in. And now, seeing you,
I came to meet you.</p>
<p>The saints hearing these things, all cried out with a loud voice: Great is our Lord, and

<p>All these things we saw and heard; we, the two brothers, who also have been sent by

<p>I Æneas was at first a protector of the Hebrews, and follower of the law; then the grace
of the Saviour and His great gift took possession of me. I recognised Christ Jesus in holy
Scripture; I came to Him, and embraced His faith, so that I might become worthy of His
holy baptism. First of all I searched for the memoirs written in those times about our Lord
Jesus Christ, which the Jews published in the age of Pontius Pilate, and we found them in
Hebrew writings, drawn up in the age of the Lord Jesus Christ; and I translated them into
the language of the Gentiles, in the reign of the eminent Theodosius, who was fulfilling his
seventeenth consulship, and of Valentinian, consul for the fifth time in the ninth indiction.
Whosoever of you read this book, and transfer it to other copies, remember me, and pray
for me, Æneas, least of the servants of God, that He be merciful to me, and pardon my sins
which I have committed against Him. Peace be to all who shall read these, and to all their

March, in the consulship of Rufinus and Rubellio, in the fourth year of the 202d Olympiad,
under the rule of Joseph and Caiaphas, priests of the Jews: the things done by the chief
priests and the rest of the Jews, which Nicodemus recorded after the cross and passion of

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>Annas and Caiaphas, Summas and Datam, Gamaliel, Judas, Levi, Neptalim, Alexander
and Jairus, and the rest of the Jews, came to Pilate, accusing the Lord Jesus Christ of many
things, and saying: We know him to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and
he says that he is the Son of God, and a king. Not only so, but he also breaks the Sabbath,
and wishes to do away with the law of our fathers. Pilate says: What is it that he does, and
wishes to destroy the law? The Jews say: We have a law, not to heal any one on the Sabbath;
but he, by evil arts, heals on the Sabbath the lame and the hunchbacked, the blind, the palsied,
the lepers, and the demoniacs. Pilate says to them: By what evil arts? They say to him: He
is a sorcerer; and by Beelzebub, prince of the demons, he casts out demons, and they are all
subject to him. Pilate says to them: It is not in an unclean spirit to cast out demons, but in
the god of Scolapius.</p>
<p>The Jews say: We pray thy majesty to set him before thy tribunal to be heard. Pilate,
calling the Jews to him, says to them: How can I, seeing that I am a governor,1954 hear a
king? They say to him: We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says he is. And Pilate,
calling a runner, says to him: Let Jesus be brought in with kindness. And the runner, going
out and recognising Him, adored Him, and spread on the ground the cloak which he carried
in his hand, saying: My lord, walk upon this, and come in, because the governor calls thee.
But the Jews, seeing what the runner did, cried out against Pilate, saying: Why didst not
thou make him come in by the voice of a crier, but by a runner? for the runner, too, seeing
him, has adored him, and has spread out before him on the ground the cloak which he held
in his hand, and has said to him: My lord, the governor calls thee.</p>
<p>And Pilate, calling the runner, says to him: Wherefore hast thou done this, and honoured
Jesus, who is called Christ? The runner says to him: When thou didst send me into Jerusalem
to Alexander, I saw him sitting upon an ass, and the children of the Hebrews breaking
branches from the trees, strewing them in the way; and others held branches in their hands;
and others spread their garments in the way, shouting and saying, Save, therefore, Thou
who art in the highest; blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!</p>
<p>The Jews cried out, saying against the runner: The children of the Hebrews indeed cried
out in Hebrew. How canst thou, a Gentile, know this? The runner says to them: I asked
one of the Jews, and said, What is it that they cry out in Hebrew? and he explained to me.
Pilate says to them: And how did they cry out in Hebrew? The Jews said: Osanna in the
highest! Pilate says to them: What is the meaning of Osanna in the highest? They say to
him: Save us, Thou who art in the highest. Pilate says to them: If you yourselves bear witness
to the terms and words in which the children cried out, in what has the runner sinned?
And they were silent. The governor says to the runner: Go out, and lead him in, in whatever

way thou wilt. And the runner, going forth, did after the same form as before, and says to
Jesus: My lord, go in, because the governor calls thee.</p>
<p>As Jesus, then, was going in, and the standard-bearers bearing the standards, the heads
of the standards were bowed of themselves, and adored Jesus. And the Jews, seeing the
standards, how they bowed themselves and adored Jesus, cried out the more against the
standard-bearers. And Pilate says to the Jews: Do you not wonder at the way in which the
standards have bowed themselves and adored Jesus? The Jews say to Pilate: we saw how
the men carrying the standards bowed themselves and adored Jesus. And the governor,
calling the standard-bearers, says to them: Why have you so done? They say to Pilate: We
are Gentile men, and slaves of the temples: how had we1955 to adore him? for when we were
holding the figures,1956 they themselves bowed and adored him.</p>
<p>Pilate says to the chiefs of the synagogue and the elders of the people: Choose ye men
powerful and strong, and let them hold the standards, and let us see whether they will bow
of themselves. And the elders of the Jews, taking twelve men very strong and powerful,
made them hold the standards, six and six; and they stood before the governor’s tribunal.
Pilate says to the runner: Take out Jesus outside of the prætorium, and bring him in again,
in whatever way thou wilt. And Jesus and the runner went outside of the prætorium. And
Pilate, calling those who had formerly held the standards, said to them: By the health of
Cæsar, if the standards do not bow themselves when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your
heads. And the governor ordered Jesus to come in a second time. And the runner did after
the same form as before, and besought Jesus much that He would go up and walk upon his
cloak. And He walked upon it, and went in. And as Jesus was going in, immediately the
standards bowed themselves, and adored Jesus.</p>

<p>And Pilate seeing, fear seized him, and immediately he wished to rise from the tribunal.
And while he was thinking of this, viz., to rise and go away, his wife sent to him, saying:
Have nothing to do with that just man,1957 for I have suffered much on account of him this
night. And Pilate, calling the Jews, said to them: Ye know that my wife is a worshipper of
God, and in Judaism thinks rather with you. The Jews say to him: So it is, and we know.
Pilate says to them: Lo, my wife has sent to me, saying: Have nothing to do with that just
man,1958 for I have suffered much on account of him this night. And the Jews answering,
said to Pilate: Did we not say to thee that he is a magician? Lo, he has sent a vision of dreams
to thy wife.</p>
<p>Pilate called Jesus, and said to him: What is it that these witness against thee, and sayest
thou nothing to them? And Jesus answered: If they had not the power, they would not
speak. Every one has power over his own mouth to say good and evil; let them see1959 to
it.</p>
<p>And the elders of the Jews answering, say to Jesus: What shall we see? First, that thou
wast born of fornication; second, that at thy birth in Bethlehem there took place a massacre
of infants; third, that thy father Joseph and thy mother Mary fled into Egypt, because they
had no confidence in the people.</p>
<p>Some of the bystanders, kind men of the Jews, say: We say that he was not born of fornication;
but we know that Mary was espoused to Joseph, and that he was not born of fornication.
Pilate says to the Jews who said that he was of fornication: This speech of yours
is not true, seeing that the betrothal took place, as these of your nation say. Annas and
Caiaphas say to Pilate: We with all the multitude say that he was born of fornication, and
that he is a magician; but these are proselytes, and his disciples. And Pilate, calling Annas
and Caiaphas, says to them: What are proselytes? They say to him: They have been born
sons of the Gentiles, and then have become Jews. Then answered those who testified that
Jesus was not born of fornication, Lazarus and Asterius, Antonius and James, Annes and
Azaras, Samuel and Isaac, Finees and Crispus, Agrippa and Judas: We were not born
proselytes, but are sons of the Jews, and we speak the truth; for we were present at the betrothal
of Mary.</p>
<p>And Pilate, calling to him those twelve men who proved that Jesus had not been born
of fornication, said to them: I adjure you by the health of Cæsar, tell me if it be true that
Jesus was not born of fornication. They say to Pilate: We have a law not to swear, because
it is a sin; but let them swear by the health of Cæsar that it is not as we say, and we are worthy

which these testify? Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate: Those twelve are believed that he is
not born of fornication; we—all the people—cry out that he was born of fornication, and is
a magician, and says that he himself is the Son of God and a king, and we are not believed.</p>
<p>And Pilate ordered all the multitude to go outside, except the twelve men who said that
He was not born of fornication, and ordered to separate Jesus from them. And Pilate says
to them: For what reason do the Jews wish to put Jesus to death? And they say to him:
They are angry because he heals on the Sabbath. Pilate said: For a good work do they wish
to put him to death? They say to him: Yes, my lord.</p>

<p>Pilate, filled with fury, went forth outside of the prætorium, and says to them: I take
the sun to witness that I find in this man not even one fault. The Jews answered and said
to the governor: If he were not an evil-doer, we should never have delivered him to thee.
Pilate says to them: Take him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews answered:
It is not permitted to us to put any one to death. Pilate says to them: Has God said to you
not to put any one to death? has He therefore said to me that I am to kill?</p>
<p>Pilate, having again gone into the prætorium, called Jesus to him privately, and said to
Him: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus answered Pilate: Speakest thou this of thyself,
or have others said it to thee of me? Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief
priests have delivered thee to me. What hast thou done? Jesus answering, said: My kingdom
is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would assuredly strive
that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence. Pilate
said to Him: Art thou then a king? Jesus said to him: Thou sayest that I am a king. For I
for this was born, and for this have I come, that I should bear witness to the truth; and every
one who is of the truth hears my voice. Pilate says to him: What is truth? Jesus says: Truth
is from heaven. Pilate says: Is not there truth upon earth? Jesus says to Pilate: Notice how
the truth-speaking are judged by those who have power upon earth.</p>

<p>Pilate therefore, leaving Jesus within the prætorium, went out to the Jews, and says to
them: I find not even one fault in him. The Jews say to him: He said, I can destroy that
temple, and in three days raise it again. Pilate said to them: What temple? The Jews say to
him: The temple which Solomon built in forty and six years; and he says that he can destroy
and build it in three days. Pilate says to them: I am innocent of the blood of this man; see
ye to it. The Jews say to him: His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</p>
<p>And Pilate, calling the elders and priests and Levites, says to them privately: Do not do
so; for in nothing, though you accuse him, do I find him deserving of death, not even about
the healing and the breaking of the Sabbath. The priests and Levites and elders say: Tell
us, if any one blaspheme Cæsar, is he deserving of death or not? Pilate says to them: He
deserves to die. The Jews answered him: How much more is he who has blasphemed God
deserving to die!</p>
<p>And the governor ordered the Jews to go outside of the prætorium; and calling Jesus,
said to Him: What am I to do to thee? Jesus says to Pilate: As it has been given thee. Pilate
says: How has it been given? Jesus says: Moses and the prophets made proclamation of
my death and resurrection. And the Jews, hearing this, say to Pilate: Why do you desire
any more to hear blasphemy? And Pilate said: If this speech is blasphemous, do you take
him, and lead him to your synagogue, and judge him according to your law. The Jews say
to Pilate: Our law holds, If a man have sinned against a man, he is worthy to receive forty
less one; but he who has blasphemed against God, to be stoned.</p>
<p>Pilate says to them: Then judge him according to your law. The Jews say to Pilate: We
wish that he be crucified. Pilate says to them: He does not deserve to be crucified.</p>
<p>And the governor, looking upon the people of the Jews standing round, saw very many
of the Jews weeping, and said: All the multitude does not wish him to die. The elders say
to Pilate: And for this reason have we come—the whole multitude—that he should die.
Pilate said to the Jews: What has he done that he should die? They say: Because he said
that he was the Son of God, and a king.</p>

<p>But one Nicodemus, a Jew, stood before the governor, and said: I entreat, mercifully
allow me to say a few words. Pilate says to him: Say on. Nicodemus says: I said to the
elders and the priests and the Levites, and to all the multitude of the Jews, in the synagogue,
What have you to do with this man? This man does many wonders and signs, which no
one of men has done or can do. Let him go, and do not devise any evil against him: if the
signs which he does are of God, they will stand; but if of men, they will come to nothing.
For Moses also, being sent by God into Egypt, did many signs, which God told him to do
before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And the sorcerers Jamnes and Mambres were there healing,
and they did, they also, the signs which Moses did, but not all; and the Egyptians deemed
them as gods, Jamnes and Mambres. And since the signs which they did were not of God,
they perished, both they and those who believed in them. And now let this man go, for he
is not deserving of death.</p>
<p>The Jews say to Nicodemus: Thou hast become his disciple, and takest his part.1960
Nicodemus says to them: Has the governor also become his disciple, and does he take his
part? Has not Cæsar set him over that dignity? And the Jews were raging and gnashing
with their teeth against Nicodemus. Pilate says to them: Why do you gnash with your teeth
against him, when you are hearing the truth? The Jews say to Nicodemus: Mayst thou receive
his truth, and a portion with him! Nicodemus says: Amen, amen, amen; may I receive it,
as you have said!</p>

<p>And of the Jews a certain other one, starting up, asks the governor that he might say a
word. The governor says: What thou wishest to say, say. And he said: For thirty-eight
years I lay in infirmity in my bed in very grievous pain. And at the coming of Jesus, many
demoniacs, and persons held down by divers infirmities, were healed by him. And some
young men had pity on me; and carrying me in my bed, laid me before him. And Jesus,
seeing, had pity on me, and said the word to me, Take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately
I was made whole; I took up my bed, and walked. The Jews say to Pilate: Ask him what
was the day on which he was healed. He said: The Sabbath. The Jews say: Have we not so
informed thee, that on the Sabbath he heals, and drives out demons?</p>
<p>And a certain other Jew starting up, said: I was born blind; I heard a voice, and saw no
man. And as Jesus was passing by, I cried out with a loud voice, Have pity upon me, thou
son of David. And he had pity upon me, and laid his hands upon my eyes, and I saw immediately.
And another Jew starting up, said: I was hunchbacked, and he straightened me
with a word. And another said: I was leprous, and he healed me with a word.</p>

<p>And also a certain woman, Veronica by name, from afar off cried out to the governor:
I was flowing with blood for twelve years; and I touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately
the flowing of my blood stopped. The Jews say: We have a law, that a woman
does not come to bear witness.</p>

<p>And certain others, a multitude of men and women, cried out, saying: That man is a
prophet, and the demons are subject to him. Pilate says to those who said the demons are
subject to him: And your masters, why are they not subject to him? They say to Pilate: We
do not know. And others said to Pilate: He raised up dead Lazarus from the tomb after
four days. The governor, hearing this, said trembling to all the multitude of the Jews: Why
do you wish to shed innocent blood?</p>

<p>And Pilate, calling Nicodemus and the twelve men who said that He was not born of
fornication, says to them: What am I to do, seeing that there is a sedition among the people?
They say to him: We do not know; let them see to it. Again Pilate, calling all the multitude
of the Jews, said: You know that you have a custom during the day of unleavened bread,
that I should release to you one that is bound. I have a notable one bound in the prison, a
murderer who is called Barabbas, and Jesus who is called Christ, in whom I find no cause
of death. Whom do you wish that I should release unto you? And they all cried out, saying:
Release unto us Barabbas. Pilate says to them: What, then, am I to do with Jesus who is
called Christ? They all say: Let him be crucified. Again the Jews said: Thou art no friend
of Cæsar’s if thou release this man, for he called himself the Son of God, and a king; unless,
perhaps, thou wishest this man to be king, and not Cæsar.</p>
<p>Then, filled with fury, Pilate said to them: Always has your nation been seditious, and
always have you been opposed to those who were for you. The Jews answered: Who are
for us? Pilate says to them: Your God,—who rescued you from the hard slavery of the
Egyptians, and led you forth out of Egypt through the sea as if through dry land, and fed
you in the desert with manna and quail, and brought water to you out of the rock, and gave
you to drink, and gave you a law; and in all these things you provoked your God, and sought
for yourselves a god, a molten calf. And you exasperated your God, and He wished to slay
you; and Moses made supplication for you, that ye should not die. And now you say that I
hate the king.</p>
<p>And rising up from the tribunal, he wished to go outside. And the Jews cried out, and
said to him: We know that Cæsar is king, and not Jesus. For the Magi also presented gifts
to him as to a king; and Herod, hearing from the Magi that a king was born, wished to slay
him. But when this was known, his father Joseph took him and his mother, and fled into
Egypt; and Herod hearing, destroyed the infants of the Jews which were born in Bethlehem.
Pilate, hearing those words, was afraid. And silence being made among the people, who
were crying out, Pilate said: This, then, is he whom Herod sought? They say to him: It is
he. And taking water, Pilate washed his hands in presence of the people, saying: I am innocent
of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. Again the Jews cried out, saying: His blood
be upon us, and upon our children.</p>
<p>Then Pilate ordered the veil to be loosened,1961 and said to Jesus: Thine own nation
have brought charges against thee as a king; and therefore I have sentenced thee first to be
scourged on account of the statutes of the emperors, and then to be crucified on a cross.</p>

<p>And when Jesus was scourged, he delivered Him to the Jews to be crucified, and two
robbers with Him; one by name Dismas, and the other by name Gestas. And when they
came to the place, they stripped Him of His garments, and girt Him about with a linen cloth,
and put a crown of thorns upon His head. Likewise also they hanged the two robbers with
Him, Dismas on the right and Gestas on the left. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do. And the soldiers parted His garments among them. And the
people stood waiting; and their chief priests and judges mocked Him, saying among themselves:
He saved others, now let him save himself; if he is the Son of God, let him come
down from the cross. And the soldiers mocked Him, falling prostrate1962 before Him, and
offering vinegar with gall, and saying: If thou art the King of the Jews, set thyself free.</p>
<p>And Pilate, after sentence, ordered a title to be written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin
letters, according to what the Jews said: This is the King of the Jews.</p>
<p>And one of the robbers who were hanged, by name Gestas, said to Him: If thou art the
Christ, free thyself and us. And Dismas answering, rebuked him, saying: Dost not even
thou fear God, who art in this condemnation? for we justly and deservedly have received
those things which we endure; but He has done no evil. And he kept saying to Jesus: Remember
me, Lord, in Thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Verily I say unto thee, that today
shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>

<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole earth; and the
sun was obscured, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And crying out with a
loud voice, He said: Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit. And thus saying, He
gave up the ghost. And the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: This
was a just man. And all the people who were present at that spectacle, seeing what was done,
beating their breasts, returned.</p>
<p>And the centurion reported to the governor what was done. And the governor and his
wife hearing, were very sorrowful, and neither ate nor drank that day. And Pilate, calling
together the Jews, said to them: Have you seen what has been done? And they said to the
governor: There has been an eclipse of the sun, as is usual.</p>
<p>And his acquaintances also stood afar off, and the women who had followed Him from
Galilee, seeing these things. And lo, a certain man, by name Joseph, holding office, a man
good and just, who did not consent to their counsels nor their deeds, from Arimathæa,1963
a city of the Jews, waiting, he also, for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate and begged the
body of Jesus. And taking Him down from the cross, he wrapped Him in clean linen, and
laid Him in his own new tomb, in which no one had been laid.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.</head>
<p>And the Jews, hearing that Joseph had begged the body of Jesus, sought for him; and
those twelve men who had said that He was not born of fornication, and Nicodemus, and
many others, who had stood before Pilate and declared His good works. And all of them
being hid, Nicodemus alone appeared to them, because he was a chief man of the Jews; and
he says to them: How have ye come into the synagogue? The Jews say to him: And thou,
how hast thou come into the synagogue, seeing that thou consentest with him? May his
portion be with thee in the world to come! Nicodemus said: Amen, amen, amen. Likewise
also Joseph, coming forth, said to them: Why are you enraged against me because I begged
the body of Jesus? Lo, I have laid him in my own new tomb, wrapping him in clean linen;
and I have rolled a stone to the door of the cave. And ye have not acted well against a just
man, since you have not borne in mind how you crucified him, and pierced him with a
lance. The Jews therefore, laying hold of Joseph, ordered him to be imprisoned because of
the Sabbath-day; and they say to him: Know that the hour compels us not to do anything
against thee, because the Sabbath is dawning. But understand that thou art worthy not even
of burial, but we will give thy flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. Joseph
says to them: That is the speech of proud Goliath, who reviled the living God against holy
David. And God hath said, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. And Pilate, intercepted1964
in his heart, took water, and washed his hands before the sun, saying, I am
innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. And you answered and said to Pilate,
His blood be upon us, and upon our children. And now I fear that some time or other the
wrath of God will come upon you and your children, as you have said. And the Jews,
hearing this, were embittered in heart; and taking Joseph, shut him up in a house where
there was no window, and set guards at the gates, and sealed the gate where Joseph had been
shut up.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath morning they took counsel with the priests and the Levites, that
they should all be assembled after the Sabbath-day. And awaking at dawn, all the multitude
in the synagogue took counsel by what death they should slay him. And when the assembly
was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much indignity; and opening the gate, they
found him not. All the people therefore were in terror, and wondered with exceeding astonishment,
because they found the seals sealed, and because Caiaphas had the keys. And no
longer did they dare to lay hand upon those who spoke before Pilate in Jesus’ defence.</p>

<p>And while they were sitting in the synagogue, and recriminating about Joseph, there
came certain of the guards whom they had asked from Pilate to guard the sepulchre of Jesus,
lest His disciples coming should steal Him. And they reported, saying to the rulers of the
synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, what had happened: how there had happened
a great earthquake, and we saw how an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and
rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb, and sat upon it; and his countenance was
like lightning, and his raiment like snow. And for fear, we became as dead. And we heard
the voice of the angel speaking to the women who had come to the sepulchre, and saying,
Be not ye afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified: He is not here; He has
risen, as He said: come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And go immediately and
tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead, and will go before you into Galilee, as He
said to you.</p>
<p>The Jews say: To what women was he speaking? The soldiers say: We do not know
who the women were. The Jews say: At what hour was it? The guards say: At midnight.
The Jews say: And why did you not detain them? The guards say: We became as dead from
fear of the angel, not hoping now to see the light of day; and how could we detain them?
The Jews says: As the Lord God liveth, we do not believe you. And the guards said to the
Jews: You have seen so great signs in that man, and have not believed; and how can you
believe us, that the Lord lives? For well have ye sworn that the Lord Jesus Christ lives. Again
the guards say to the Jews: we have heard that you have shut up Joseph, who begged the
body of Jesus, in the prison, and have sealed it with your rings; and on opening, that you
have not found him. Give us Joseph, then, and we shall give you Jesus Christ. The Jews
said: Joseph has gone to Arimathea, his own city. The guards say to the Jews: And Jesus,
as we have heard from the angel, is in Galilee.</p>
<p>And the Jews, hearing these sayings, feared exceedingly, saying: Lest at some time or
other this saying be heard, and all believe in Jesus. And the Jews, taking counsel among
themselves, brought forth a sufficient number of silver pieces, and gave to the soldiers, saying:
Say that, while we slept, his disciples came and stole him. And if this be heard by the governor,
we shall persuade1965 him, and make you secure. And the soldiers, taking the money,
said as they were advised by the Jews; and their saying was spread abroad among all.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.</head>
<p>And Finees a certain priest, and Addas a teacher, and Egias a Levite, coming down from
Galilee to Jerusalem, reported to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites,
how they had seen Jesus sitting, and his disciples with him, on the Mount of Olivet, which
is called Mambre or Malech. And he said to his disciples: Go into all the world, and declare
to every creature the Gospel of the kingdom of God. He who believeth and is baptized shall
be saved; but he who believeth not shall be condemned. And these signs shall follow them
who believe: In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new tongues; they
shall take up serpents; and if they have drunk any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they
shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall be well. And as Jesus was thus speaking to his
disciples, we saw him taken up into heaven.1966</p>
<p>The priests and the Levites and the elders say to them: Give glory to the God of Israel,
and give confession to Him, whether you have both heard and seen those things which you
have related. Those who had made the report say: As the Lord God of our fathers liveth,
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, we have heard and seen.
The Jews say to them: Have you come for this—to tell us? or have you come to give prayer
to God? They said: We have come to give prayer to God. The elders and chief priests and
Levites say to them: And if you have come to give prayer to God, why have you murmured
before all the people about that foolish tale? Finees the priest, and Addas the teacher, and
Egias the Levite, say to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites: If those
words which we have spoken, which we have seen and heard, be sin, behold, we are in your
presence; do unto us according to that which is good in your eyes. And they, taking the
law, adjured them to report the words to no one thereafter. And they gave them to eat and
drink, and put them outside of the city, giving them silver and pieces, and three men with
them, who should conduct them as far as Galilee.</p>
<p>Then the Jews took counsel among themselves when those men had gone up into Galilee;
and the rulers of the synagogue shut themselves in, and were cut up1967 with great fury,
saying: What sign is this which hath come to pass in Israel? And Annas and Caiaphas say:
Why are your souls sorrowful? Are we to believe the soldiers, that an angel of the Lord came
down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb? No; but that his
disciples have given much gold to those who were guarding the sepulchre, and have taken
Jesus away, and have taught them thus to say: Say ye that an angel of the Lord came down
from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. Do you not know that

<p>And Nicodemus rising up, stood in the midst of the counsel, and said: You have said
rightly. And are not the men who have come down from Galilee God-fearing, men of peace,
hating a lie? And they recounted with an oath, how “we saw Jesus sitting on Mount Mambre
with his disciples, and he taught them in our hearing,” and that they saw him taken up into
heaven. And no one asked them this: How he was taken up into heaven. And, as the
writing of the holy book teaches us, holy Elias too was taken up into heaven, and Elisæus
cried out with a loud voice, and Elias threw his sheepskin over Elisæus; and again Elisæus
threw that sheepskin over the Jordan, and went over and came to Jericho. And the sons of
the prophets met him, and said to Elisæus, Where is thy master Elias? And he said, He has
been taken up into heaven. And they said to Elisæus, Has a spirit snatched him away, and
thrown him upon one of the mountains? But rather let us take our boys1968 with us and
seek him. And they persuaded Elisæus, and he went with them. And they sought him for
three days and three nights, and found him not, because he was taken up. And now, men,
hear me, and let us send into all Israel, and see lest Jesus can have been taken up somewhere
or other, and thrown upon one of the mountains. And that saying pleased all. And they
sent to all the mountains of Israel to seek Jesus, and they found Him not; but they found
Joseph of Arimathæa, and no one dared to lay hold of him.</p>
<p>And they reported to the elders and priests and Levites: We have gone round all the
mountains of Israel, and not found Jesus; but we have found Joseph in Arimathæa. And
hearing of Joseph, they rejoiced, and gave glory to the God of Israel. And the rulers of the
synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, taking counsel in what manner they should send
to Joseph, took paper, and wrote to Joseph:—</p>
<p>Peace to thee and all that is thine! We know that we have sinned against God, and
against thee; and thou hast prayed to the God of Israel, and He has delivered thee out of our
hands. And now deign to come to thy fathers and thy children, because we have been
vehemently grieved. We have all sought for thee—we who opened the door, and found thee
not. We know that we counselled evil counsel against thee; but the Lord hath supplanted
our counsel against thee. Thou art worthy to be honoured, father Joseph, by all the people.</p>
<p>And they chose out of all Israel seven men friendly to Joseph, whom also Joseph knew
to be friendly; and the rulers of the synagogue and the priests and the Levites say to them:
See, if he take the letter and read it, for certain he will come with you to us; but if he do not
read it, you may know that he is ill-disposed toward us, and, saluting him in peace, return
to us. And blessing them, they sent them away. And they came to Arimathæa to Joseph,
<note type="footnote">1968 i.e., servants.</note>

<pb n="1443"/>
and adored him on their face upon the ground, and said: Peace to thee and all thine! And
Joseph said: Peace to you, and to all the people of Israel! And they gave him the roll of the
letter. And Joseph took and read it, and rolled up the letter, and blessed God, and said:
Blessed be the Lord God, who hath delivered Israel from shedding innocent blood; and
blessed be God, who sent His angel, and covered me under his wings. And he kissed them,
and set a table for them; and they ate and drank, and slept there.</p>
<p>And they rose in the morning; and Joseph saddled his ass, and travelled with them, and
they came into the holy city Jerusalem. And there met them all the people, crying out, and
saying: Peace be in thy coming in, father Joseph! To whom he answered and said: The
peace of the Lord be upon all the people! And they all kissed him. And they prayed with
Joseph, and were terrified at the sight of him. And Nicodemus took him into his house,
and made a great feast, and called Annas and Caiaphas, and the elders and chief priests and
Levites, to his house. And making merry, and eating and drinking with Joseph, they blessed
God, and went every one to his own house. And Joseph remained in the house of Nicodemus.</p>
<p>And on the next day, which is the preparation, the priests and the rulers of the synagogue
and the Levites rose early, and came to the house of Nicodemus. And Nicodemus met them,
and said to them: Peace to you! And they said to him: Peace to thee and Joseph, and to
thy house and Joseph’s house! And Nicodemus brought them into his house. And the
council sat; and Joseph sat between Annas and Caiaphas, and no one dared to say a word.
And Joseph said to them: Why have you called me? And they made signs with their eyes
to Nicodemus, that he should speak with Joseph. And Nicodemus, opening his mouth,
said: Father Joseph, thou knowest that the reverend teachers, priests, and Levites seek to
hear a word from thee. And Joseph said: Ask. And Annas and Caiaphas, taking up the
law, adjured Joseph, saying: Give glory to the God of Israel, and give confession to Him,
that thou wilt not hide any word1969 from us. And they said to him: With grief were we
grieved that thou didst beg the body of Jesus, and wrap it in clean linen, and lay it in a tomb.
Therefore we shut thee up in a house where there was no window, and put a lock and a seal
on the gate; and on the first day of the week we opened the gates, and found thee not. We
were therefore exceedingly grieved, and astonishment came over all the people of God. And
therefore hast thou been sent for; and now tell us what has happened.</p>
<p>Then said Joseph: On the day of the Preparation, about the tenth hour, you shut me
in, and I remained there the whole Sabbath in full. And when midnight came, as I was
standing and praying, the house where you shut me in was hung up by the four corners,
and there was a flashing of light in mine eyes. And I fell to the ground trembling. Then
some one lifted me up from the place where I had fallen, and poured over me an abundance
of water from the head even to the feet, and put round my nostrils the odour of a wonderful
<note type="footnote">1969 The Greek ῥῆμαmeans thing as well as word.</note>

<pb n="1444"/>
ointment, and rubbed my face with the water itself, as if washing me, and kissed me, and
said to me, Joseph, fear not; but open thine eyes, and see who it is that speaks to thee. And
looking, I saw Jesus; and being terrified, I thought it was a phantom. And with prayer and
the commandments I spoke to him, and he spoke with me. And I said to him: Art thou
Rabbi Elias? And he said to me: I am not Elias. And I said: Who art thou, my lord? And
he said to me: I am Jesus, whose body thou didst beg from Pilate, and wrap in clean linen;
and thou didst lay a napkin on my face, and didst lay me in thy new tomb, and roll a stone
to the door of the tomb. Then I said to him that was speaking to me: Show me, Lord, where
I laid thee. And he led me, and showed me the place where I laid him, and the linen which
I had put on him, and the napkin which I had wrapped upon his face; and I knew that it
was Jesus. And he took hold of me with his hand, and put me in the midst of my house
though the gates were shut, and put me in my bed, and said to me: Peace to thee! And he
kissed me, and said to me: For forty days go not out of thy house; for, lo, I go to my brethren
into Galilee.</p>

<p>And the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, hearing these words
from Joseph, became as it were dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour.
And Joseph and Nicodemus entreated them, saying: Arise and stand upon your feet, and
taste bread, and comfort your souls, seeing that to-morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord. And
they arose, and entreated the Lord, and ate and drank, and went every man to his own house.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath the teachers and doctors sat questioning each other, and saying:
What is this wrath that has come upon us? because we know his father and mother. Levi
the teacher said: I know that his parents fear God, and never depart from prayer, and give
tithes thrice a-year. And when Jesus was born, his parents brought him up to this place,
and gave to God sacrifices and burnt-offerings. And assuredly the great teacher Simeon
took him into his arms, saying: Now Thou sendest away Thy servant, O Lord, according
to Thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared
before the face of all peoples, a light for the revealing of the nations, and the glory of Thy
people Israel. And he blessed Mary his mother, and said, I make an announcement to thee
concerning this child. And Mary said, Well, my lord.1970 And Simeon said, Well. And he
said again, Lo, he has been set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign
which shall be spoken against; and a sword shall pierce thine own soul, that the thoughts of
many hearts may be revealed.</p>
<p>And the Jews said to Levi: And how knowest thou these things? Levi says: Do you not
know that from him I learned the law? They of the council say: We wish to see thy father.
And they searched out his father, and got information; for he said: Why did you not believe
my son? The blessed and just Simeon taught him the law. The council says to Rabbi Levi:
The saying which thou hast spoken is true. The chief priests and rulers of the synagogue,
and Levites, said to each other: Come, let us send into Galilee to the three men who came
hither and gave an account of his teaching and his being taken up, and let them tell us how
they saw him taken up into heaven. And that saying pleased all. Then they sent three men
into Galilee; and Go, said they, say to Rabbi Addas and Rabbi Finees and Rabbi Egias, Peace
to you and yours! Many investigations have been made in the council concerning Jesus;
therefore have we been instructed to call you to the holy place, to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The men went to Galilee, and found them sitting, and meditating on the law. And they
saluted them in peace. And they said: Why have you come? The messengers said: The
council summon you to the holy city Jerusalem. And the men, hearing that they were sought
for by the council, prayed to God, and reclined with the men, and ate and drank with them.
And rising in the morning, they went to Jerusalem in peace.</p>

<p>And on the morrow the council sat; and they questioned them, saying: Did you plainly
see Jesus sitting on Mount Mambre teaching his disciples, and taken up into heaven?</p>
<p>First Addas the teacher says: I really saw him sitting on Mount Mambre teaching his
disciples; and a shining cloud overshadowed him and his disciples, and he went up into
heaven; and his disciples prayed upon their faces on the ground. And calling Finees the
priest, they questioned him also, saying: How didst thou see Jesus taken up? And he said
the same as the other. And again they called the third, Rabbi Egias, and questioned him,
and he said the same as the first and second. And those who were in the council said: The
law of Moses holds that by the mouth of two or three every word should stand. Abudem,
a teacher, one of the doctors, says: It is written in the law, Enoch walked with God, and was
translated; for God took him. Jairus, a teacher, said: And we have heard of the death of
holy Moses, and have not seen it; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And Moses died
according to the word1971 of the Lord, and no man knoweth of his burying even to the
present day. Rabbi Levi said: What is it that Rabbi Simeon said: Lo, he lies for the fall and
rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against? Rabbi Isaac
said: It is written in the law, Lo, I send mine angel, who shall go before thy face to keep thee
in every good way, because I have brought his1972 new name.</p>
<p>Then Annas and Caiaphas said: Rightly have ye said that these things are written in the
law of Moses, that no one saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the burying of
holy Moses. And Jesus gave account to1973 Pilate, and we saw him scourged, and receiving
spitting on his face; and the soldiers put a crown of thorns on him, and he received sentence
from Pilate; and then he was crucified, and they gave him gall and vinegar to drink, and two
robbers were crucified with him, and the soldier Longinus pierced his side with a lance; and
our honourable father Joseph begged his body, and he has risen again, and, as they say, the
three teachers have seen him taken up into heaven. And Rabbi Levi has borne witness to
what was said by Simeon the elder—that he has been set for the fall and rising again of many
in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against.</p>
<p>Then Didas, a teacher, said to all the assembly: If all the things which these have borne
witness to have come to pass in Jesus, they are from God, and let it not be wonderful in our
eyes.1974 The chiefs of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, said to each other
how our law holds, saying: His name shall be blessed for ever: His place endureth before
the sun, and His seat before the moon: and all the tribes of earth shall be blessed in Him,

<p>And Joseph rose up and said to Annas and Caiaphas: Truly and well do you wonder,
since you have heard that Jesus has been seen alive from the dead, ascending up into heaven.
But it is more to be wondered at that he is not the only one who has risen from the dead:
but he has raised up alive out of their tombs many others of the dead, and they have been
seen by many in Jerusalem. And hear me now, that we all know the blessed Simeon, the
great priest, who took up with his hands Jesus, when an infant, in the temple. And Simeon
himself had two sons, full brothers; and we all were at their falling asleep, and at their burial.
Go, therefore, and see their tombs: for they are open, because they have risen; and, behold,
they are in the city of Arimathæa, living together in prayers. And, indeed, they are heard
crying out, but speaking with nobody, and they are silent as the dead. But come, let us go
to them; let us conduct them to us with all honour and respect. And if we adjure them,
perhaps they will speak to us of the mystery of their resurrection.</p>
<p>At hearing this they all rejoiced. And Annas and Caiaphas, Nicodemus, and Joseph,
and Gamaliel, went, and did not find them in their sepulchres; but, walking into the city of
Arimathea, they found them there, on their bended knees, and spending their time in
prayer. And kissing them, they conducted them to Jerusalem, into the synagogue, with all
veneration and fear of God. And shutting the doors, and lifting up the law of the Lord, they
put it in their hands, adjuring them by the God Adonai, and the God of Israel, who by the
law and the prophets spoke to our fathers, saying: Do you believe that it was Jesus who
raised you from the dead? Tell us how you have risen from the dead.</p>
<p>Karinus and Leucius, hearing this adjuration, trembled in their body, and groaned, being
disturbed in heart. And together they looked towards heaven, and with their fingers made
the sign of the cross on their tongues, and immediately they spoke together, saying: Give
each of us sheets of paper, and let us write what we have seen and heard. And they gave it
to them. And they sat down, and each of them wrote, saying:—</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">

<head>Chapter 2 (18).</head>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrection and the life of the dead, permit us to speak mysteries
through the death of Thy cross, because we have been adjured by Thee. For Thou
didst order Thy servants to relate to no one the secrets of Thy divine majesty which Thou
didst in Hades. And when we were, along with all our fathers, lying in the deep, in the
blackness of darkness, suddenly there appeared a golden heat1976 of the sun, and a purple
royal light shining upon us. And immediately the father of all the human race, with all the
patriarchs and prophets, exulted, saying: That light is the source of eternal light, which hath
promised to transmit to us co-eternal light. And Esaias cried out, and said: This is the light
of the Father, the Son of God, as I predicted when I was alive upon earth: The land of Zabulon
and the land of Nephthalim across Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the people who sat in
darkness, have seen a great light; and light was shining among those who are in the region
of the shadow of death. And now it has come and shone upon us sitting in death.</p>
<p>And when we were all exulting in the light which shone over us, there came up to us
our father Simeon; and he said, exulting: Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
because I took Him up when born, an infant, in my hands in the temple; and instigated by
the Holy Spirit, I said to Him, confessing: Now mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which
Thou hast prepared in the sight of all peoples, a light for the revealing of the nations, and
the glory of Thy people Israel. When they heard this, all the multitude of the saints exulted
more.</p>
<p>And after this there comes up, as it were, a dweller in the desert; and he is asked by all:
Who art thou? To whom he says in answer: I am John, the voice and prophet of the Most
High, going before the face of His coming to prepare His ways, to give the knowledge of
salvation to His people for the remission of their sins. And seeing Him coming to me, instigated
by the Holy Spirit, I said: Behold the Lamb of God! behold Him who taketh away
the sins of the world! And I baptized Him in the river of Jordan, and I saw the Holy Spirit
descending upon Him in the form of a dove; and I heard a voice from the heavens saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And now I have gone before His face,
and have descended to announce to you that the rising Son of God is close at hand to visit
us, coming from on high to us sitting in darkness and the shadow of death.</p>

<p>And when the first created, father Adam, had heard this, that Jesus was baptized in
Jordan, he cried out to his son Seth: Tell thy sons, the patriarchs and the prophets, all that
thou heardest from Michael the archangel when I sent thee to the gates of paradise to implore
God that he might send thee His angel to give thee oil from the tree of mercy, with which
to anoint my body when I was sick. Then Seth, coming near to the holy patriarchs and
prophets, said: When I, Seth, was praying to the Lord at the gates of paradise, behold Michael,
the angel of the Lord, appeared to me, saying, I have been sent to thee by the Lord. I am set
over the human race.1977 And to thee, Seth, I say, do not labour with tears in prayers and
supplications on account of the oil of the tree of mercy to anoint thy father Adam for the
pain of his body, because in no wise shalt thou receive of it, except in the last days and times,
except when five thousand and five hundred years have been fulfilled: then will come upon
the earth the most beloved Son of God, to raise up again the body of Adam, and the bodies
of the dead; and He, when He comes, will be baptized in Jordan. And when he shall have
come out of the water of Jordan, then with the oil of His mercy shall He anoint all that believe
on Him; and that oil of mercy shall be for the generation of those who shall be born out of
water and the Holy Spirit into life eternal. Then, descending upon earth, Christ Jesus, the
most beloved Son of God, will lead our father Adam into paradise to the tree of mercy.</p>

<head>Chapter 4 (20).</head>
<p>And when all the saints were exulting, lo, Satan, the prince and leader of death, said to
Hades: Make thyself ready to receive Jesus, who boasts himself to be the Son of God, and
is a man fearing death, and saying, My soul is sorrowful, even unto death. And he has
withstood me much, doing me evil; and many whom I made blind, lame, deaf, leprous, and
demoniac, he has healed with a word; and those whom I have brought to thee dead, he has
dragged away from thee.</p>
<p>Hades, answering, said to Prince Satan: Who is he that is so powerful, when he is a man
in fear of death? For all the powerful of the earth are kept in subjection by my power, whom
thou hast brought into subjection by thy power. If then, thou art powerful, what is that man
Jesus like, who, though fearing death, withstands thy power? If he is so powerful in humanity,
verily I say unto thee, he is all-powerful in divinity, and his power can no one resist. And
when he says that he fears death, he wishes to lay hold on thee, and woe will be to thee to
the ages of eternity. And Satan, prince of Tartarus, answered and said: Why hast thou
doubted, and feared to receive this Jesus, thy adversary and mine? For I have tempted him,
and I have roused up my ancient people the Jews with hatred and anger against him; I have
sharpened a lance to strike him; I have mixed gall and vinegar to give him to drink; and I
have prepared wood to crucify him, and nails to pierce him, and his death is near at hand,
that I may bring him to thee, subject to thee and me.</p>
<p>Tartarus answered and said: Thou hast told me that it is he himself who has dragged
away the dead from me. Now there are many who are here kept by me, who, while they
lived on earth, took the dead from me, not by their own powers, but by godly prayers, and
their almighty God dragged them away from me. Who is that Jesus, who by his word has
withdrawn the dead from me without prayers? Perhaps he is the same who, by, the word
of his command, brought alive Lazarus, after he had been four days in stench and corruption,
whom I kept dead. Satan prince of death answered and said: That Jesus is the same. And
when Hades heard this he said to him: I adjure thee by thy powers and mine, do not bring
him to me. For I at that time, when I heard the command of his word, trembled with terror
and dismay, and all my officers at the same time were confounded along with me. Nor
could we keep that Lazarus; but, shaking himself like an eagle, he sprang out, and went forth
from us with all activity and speed, and the same ground which held the dead body of Lazarus
immediately gave him forth alive. So now, I know that that man who could do these things
is God, strong in authority, powerful in humanity, and He is the Saviour of the human race.
But if thou bring Him to me, all who are here shut up in the cruelty of the prison, and bound
by their sins in chains that cannot be loosened, He will let loose, and will bring to the life of
His divinity for ever.</p>

<p>And as Prince Satan and Hades were thus speaking to each other in turn, suddenly there
was a voice as of thunders, and a shouting of spirits: Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be
ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall come in.1978 Hades hearing
this, said to Prince Satan: Retire from me, and go outside of my realms: if thou art a
powerful warrior, fight against the King of glory. But what hast thou to do with Him? And
Hades thrust Satan outside of his realms. And Hades said to his impious officers: Shut the
cruel gates of brass, and put up the bars of iron, and resist bravely, that we, holding captivity,
may not take Him captive.1979</p>
<p>And all the multitude of the saints, hearing this, said to Hades, with the voice of reproach:
Open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in. And David cried out, saying:
Did I not, when I was alive upon earth, prophesy to you: Let them confess to the Lord His
tender mercies and His wonderful works to the children of men: for He has shattered the
brazen gates, and burst the iron bars; He has taken them up out of the way of their
iniquity?1980 And after this, in like manner, Esaias said: Did not I, when I was alive upon
earth, prophesy to you: The dead shall rise up, and those who are in their tombs shall rise
again, and those who are upon earth shall exult; because the dew, which is from the Lord,
is their health?1981 And again I said, Where, O Death, is thy sting? where, O Hades, is thy
victory?1982</p>
<p>And when all the saints heard this from Esaias, they said to Hades: Open thy gates.
Since thou art now conquered, thou wilt be weak and powerless. And there was a great
voice, as of thunders, saying: Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye infernal
gates; and the King of glory shall come in. Hades, seeing that they had twice shouted out
this, says, as if not knowing: Who is the king of glory? David says, in answer to Hades: I
recognise those words of the shout, since I prophesied the same by His Spirit. And now,
what I have said above I say to thee, The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle;
He is the King of glory.1983 And the Lord Himself hath looked down from heaven upon
earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners, and to release the sons of the slain.1984 And now,
most filthy and most foul Hades, open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in. While
David was thus speaking, there came to Hades, in the form of a man, the Lord of majesty,

<p>When this was seen by Hades and Death, and their impious officers, along with their
cruel servants, they trembled at perceiving in their own dominions the clearness of so great
a light, when they saw Christ suddenly in their abodes; and they cried out, saying: We have
been overcome by thee. Who art thou, that to the Lord directest our confusion?1986 Who
art thou, that, undestroyed by corruption, the uncorrupted proof of thy majesty, with fury
condemnest our power? Who art thou, so great and little, lowly and exalted, soldier and
commander, wonderful warrior in the form of a slave, and the king of glory dead and alive,
whom slain the cross has carried? Thou, who didst lie dead in the sepulchre, hast come
down to us alive; and in thy death every creature trembled, and the stars in a body were
moved; and now thou hast been made free among the dead, and disturbest our legions.
Who art thou, that settest free those who art held captive, bound by original sin, and recallest
them to their former liberty? Who art thou, who sheddest a divine, and splendid, and illuminating
light upon those who have been blinded by the darkness of their sins?</p>
<p>In like manner, also, all the legions of the demons, terror-stricken with like fear from
their fearful overthrow, cried out, saying: Whence art thou, O Jesus, a man so powerful and
splendid in majesty, so excellent, without spot, and free from guilt? For that world of earth
which has been subject to us always until now, which used to pay tribute for our uses, has
never sent us such a dead man, has never destined such gifts for the powers below. Who
therefore art thou, that hast so intrepidly entered our bounds, and who hast not only no
fear of our punishments, but, moreover, attemptest to take all away from our chains? Perhaps
thou art that Jesus of whom our prince Satan said, that by thy death of the cross thou wast
destined to receive the dominion of the whole world.</p>
<p>Then the King of glory, trampling on death by His majesty, and seizing Prince Satan,
delivered him to the power of Hades, and drew Adam to His brightness.</p>

<p>Then Hades, receiving Prince Satan, said to him, with vehement revilings: O prince of
perdition, and leader of extermination, Beelzebub, derision of angels, to be spit upon by the
just, why didst thou wish to do this? Didst thou wish to crucify the King of glory, in whose
death thou didst promise us so great spoils? Like a fool, thou didst not know what thou
wast doing. For, behold, that Jesus by the splendour of His divinity is putting to flight all
the darkness of death, and He has broken into the strong lowest depths of our dungeons,
and has brought out the captives, and released those who were bound. And all who used
to groan under our torments insult us, and by their prayers our dominions are taken by
storm, and our realms conquered, and no race of men has now any respect for us. Moreover,
also, we are grievously threatened by the dead, who have never been haughty to us, and who
have not at any time been joyful as captives. O Prince Satan, father of all impious wretches
and renegades, why didst thou wish to do this? Of those who from the beginning, even
until now, have despaired of salvation and life, no bellowing after the usual fashion is now
heard here; and no groaning of theirs resounds, nor in any of their faces is a trace of tears
found. O Prince Satan, possessor of the keys of the lower regions, all thy riches which thou
hadst acquired by the tree of transgression and the loss of paradise, thou hast now lost by
the tree of the cross, and all thy joy has perished. When thou didst hang up that Christ Jesus
the King of glory, thou wast acting against thyself and against me. Henceforth thou shalt
know what eternal torments and infinite punishments thou art to endure in my everlasting
keeping. O Prince Satan, author of death, and source of all pride, thou oughtest first to have
inquired into the bad cause of that Jesus. Him in whom thou perceivedst no fault, why,
without reason, didst thou dare unjustly to crucify? and why hast thou brought to our regions
one innocent and just, and lost the guilty, the impious, and the unjust of the whole world?</p>
<p>And when Hades had thus spoken to Prince Satan, then the King of glory said to Hades:
Satan the prince will be in thy power for ever, in place of Adam and his sons, my just ones.</p>

<p>And the Lord stretched out His hand, and said: Come to me, all my saints, who have
my image and likeness. Do you, who have been condemned through the tree and the devil
and death, now see the devil and death condemned through the tree. Immediately all the
saints were brought together under the hand of the Lord. And the Lord, holding Adam by
the right hand, said to him: Peace be to thee, with all thy children, my righteous ones! And
Adam fell down at the knees of the Lord, and with tearful entreaty praying, said with a loud
voice: I will extol Thee, O Lord; for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to
rejoice over me. O Lord God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me. O Lord, Thou
hast brought out my soul from the powers below; Thou hast saved me from them that go
down into the pit. Sing praises to the Lord, all His saints, and confess to the memory of His
holiness; since there is anger in His indignation, and life in His goodwill.1987 In like manner
also all the saints of God, falling on their knees at the feet of the Lord, said with one voice:
Thou hast come, O Redeemer of the world: as Thou hast foretold by the law and Thy
prophets, so hast Thou fulfilled by Thy deeds. Thou hast redeemed the living by Thy cross;
and by the death of the cross Thou hast come down to us, to rescue us from the powers below,
and from death, by Thy majesty. O Lord, as Thou hast set the title of Thy glory in heaven,
and hast erected as the title of redemption Thy cross upon earth, so, O Lord, set in Hades
the sign of the victory of Thy cross, that death may no more have dominion.</p>
<p>And the Lord, stretching forth His hand, made the sign of the cross upon Adam and
upon all His saints; and holding Adam by the right hand, went up from the powers below:
and all the saints followed Him. Then holy David cried out aloud, saying: Sing unto the
Lord a new song, for He hath done wonderful things; His right hand and His holy arm have
brought salvation to Himself. The Lord hath made known His salvation; His righteousness
hath He revealed in the sight of the heathen.1988 And all the multitude of the saints answered,

was taken up by a fiery chariot. Here also even until now we have not tasted death, but have

is the sign which thou carriest on thy shoulders? In answer to them, he said: Truly have
you said that I was a robber, doing all sorts of evil upon the earth. And the Jews crucified
me along with Jesus; and I saw the miracles in created things which were done through the
cross of Jesus crucified, and I believed Him to be the Creator of all created things, and the
King omnipotent; and I entreated Him, saying, Be mindful of me, Lord, when Thou shalt
have come into Thy kingdom. Immediately He accepted my entreaty, and said to me, Amen;
I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.1996 And He gave me this sign of
the cross, saying, Walk into paradise carrying this; and if the guardian angel of paradise will
not let thee go in, show him the sign of the cross, and thou shalt say to him, Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who has now been crucified, has sent me. Having done so, I said all this to
the guardian angel of paradise. And when he heard this, he immediately opened, and led
me in, and placed me at the right of paradise, saying, Lo, hold a little, and there will come
in the father of the whole human race, Adam, with all his children, holy and just, after the
triumph and glory of the ascension of Christ the crucified Lord. Hearing all these words of
the robber, all the holy patriarchs and prophets with one voice said: Blessed art Thou, O
Lord Almighty, Father of everlasting benefits, and Father of mercies, who hast given such
grace to Thy sinners, and hast brought them back into the grace of paradise, and into Thy
rich pastures; for this is spiritual life most sure. Amen, amen.</p>

<head>Chapter 11 (27).</head>
<p>These are the divine and sacred mysteries which we saw and heard, I Karinus, and
Leucius. More we are not allowed to tell of the other mysteries of God, as Michael the
archangel adjured us, and said: You shall go into Jerusalem with your brethren, and continue
in prayers, and you shall cry out, and glorify the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, who
has raised you up again from the dead with Himself. And with none of men shall you speak;
and you shall sit as if dumb, until the hour shall come when the Lord Himself shall permit
you to relate the mysteries of His divinity. And Michael the archangel ordered us to walk
across Jordan into a place rich and fertile, where there are many who rose again along with
us for an evidence of the resurrection of Christ the Lord; because only three days were allowed
to us who have risen from the dead to celebrate in Jerusalem the passover of the Lord, with
our living relations, for an evidence of the resurrection of Christ the Lord: and we have
been baptized in the holy river of Jordan, receiving each of us white robes. And after three
days, when we had celebrated the passover of the Lord, all who rose again along with us
were snatched up into the clouds, and taken across the Jordan, and were no longer seen by
any one. But we were told to remain in the city of Arimathæa in prayers.</p>
<p>These are the things which the Lord commanded us to relate to you. Give Him praise
and confession, and be penitent, that He may have mercy upon you. Peace be to you from
the same Lord Jesus Christ, and the Saviour of all of us! Amen.</p>
<p>And after they had finished all, writing on separate sheets of paper, they arose. And
Karinus gave what he wrote into the hands of Annas and Caiaphas and Gamaliel; in like
manner also Leucius gave what he wrote into the hands of Nicodemus and Joseph. And
being suddenly transfigured, they became exceedingly white, and were seen no more. And
their writings were found exactly the same, not one letter more or less.</p>
<p>All the synagogue of the Jews, hearing all these wonderful sayings of Karinus and Leucius,
said to each other: Truly all these things have been done by the Lord, and blessed be the
Lord for ever and ever. Amen. And they all went out with great anxiety, beating their breasts
with fear and trembling; and they went away, each to his own house.</p>
<p>All these things which were said by the Jews in their synagogue Joseph and Nicodemus
immediately reported to the proconsul. And Pilate himself wrote all which had been done
and said concerning Jesus by the Jews, and he placed all the words in the public records of
his prætorium.</p>

<head>Chapter 12 (28).</head>
<p>After this, Pilate going into the temple of the Jews, assembled all the chief priests, and
learned men, and scribes, and teachers of the law, and went in with them into the sanctuary
of the temple, and ordered that all the gates should be shut, and said to them: We have
heard that you have a certain great collection of books in this temple: therefore I ask you
that it be presented before us. And when four officers brought in that collection of books,
adorned with gold and precious gems, Pilate said to all: I adjure you by the God of your
fathers, who ordered you to build this temple in the place of his sanctuary, not to conceal
the truth from me. You all know what is written in that collection of books; but now say
whether you have found in the writings that Jesus, whom you have crucified, to be the Son
of God that was to come for the salvation of the human race, and in how many revolutions
of the seasons he ought to come. Declare to me whether you crucified him in ignorance of
this, or knowing it.</p>
<p>Being thus adjured, Annas and Caiaphas ordered all the others who were with them to
go out of the sanctuary; and themselves shut all the gates of the temple and the sanctuary,
and said to Pilate: We have been adjured by thee, O good judge, by the building of this
temple, to give thee the truth, and a clear account of this matter. After we had crucified Jesus,
not knowing Him to be the Son of God, thinking that He did miracles by means of some
charm, we made a great synagogue in this temple. And conferring with each other of the
signs of the miracles which Jesus had done, we found many witnesses of our nation who
said that they had seen Jesus alive after suffering death, and that He had penetrated into the
height of heaven. And we have seen two witnesses, whom Jesus raised up again from the
dead, who told us many wonderful things that Jesus did among the dead, which we have in
our hands, written out. And our custom is, every year before our synagogue, to open that
holy collection of books, and seek out the testimony of God. And we have found in the first
book of the LXX., where the archangel Michael spoke to the third son of Adam, the first
man, of five thousand and five hundred years, in which the Christ, the most beloved Son of
God, was to come from the heavens; and upon this we have considered that perhaps He was
the God of Israel who said to Moses,1997 Make to thee the ark of the covenant, two cubits
and a half in length, one cubit and a half in breadth, one cubit and a half in height. In these
five and a half cubits we have understood and recognised, from the structure of the ark of
the old covenant, that in five and a half thousands of years, Jesus Christ was to come in the
ark of the body; and we have found Him to be the God of Israel, the Son of God. Because
after His passion, we, the chief priests, wondering at the signs which happened on account
of Him, opened this collection of books, searching out all the generations, even to the generation
of Joseph, and reckoning that Mary the mother of Christ was of the seed of David;
<note type="footnote">1997 Ex. xxv. 10.</note>

<pb n="1462"/>
and we have found that from the time that God made the heaven and the earth and the first
man, to the deluge, are two thousand two hundred and twelve1998 years; and from the deluge
to the building of the tower, five hundred and thirty-one1999 years; and from the building
of the tower to Abraham, six hundred and six2000 years; and from Abraham to the arrival
of the children of Israel from Egypt, four hundred and seventy years; from the coming of
the children of Israel out of Egypt to the building of the temple, five hundred and eleven
years; and from the building of the temple to the destruction of the same temple, four hundred
and sixty-four years. Thus far have we found in the book of Esdras. After searching,
we find that from the burning of the temple to the advent of Christ, and His birth, there are
six hundred and thirty-six2001 years, which together were five thousand five hundred years,
as we have found written in the book that Michael the archangel foretold to Seth the third
son of Adam, that in five and a half thousands of years Christ the Son of God would
come.2002 Even until now we have told no one, that there might be no dissension in our
synagogues. And now thou hast adjured us, O good judge, by this holy book of the testimonies
of God, and we make it manifest to thee. And now we adjure thee, by thy life and
safety, to make manifest these words to no one in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Pilate, hearing these words of Annas and Caiaphas, laid them all up in the acts of our
Lord and Saviour, in the public records of his prætorium, and wrote a letter to Claudius,
king of the city of Rome,2003 saying:—</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate to Claudius his king, greeting. It has lately happened, as I myself have
also proved, that the Jews, through envy, have punished themselves and their posterity by
a cruel condemnation. In short, when their fathers had a promise that their God would
send them from heaven his holy one, who should deservedly be called their king, and
promised that he would send him by a virgin upon the earth: when, therefore, while I was
procurator, he had come into Judæa, and when they saw him enlightening the blind,
cleansing the lepers, curing the paralytics, making demons flee from men, even raising the
dead, commanding the winds, walking dryshod upon the waves of the sea, and doing many
other signs of miracles; and when all the people of the Jews said that he was the Son of God,
the chief priests felt envy against him, and seized him, and delivered him to me; and, telling
me one lie after another, they said that he was a sorcerer, and was acting contrary to their
law.</p>
<p>And I believed that it was so, and delivered him to be scourged, according to their will.
And they crucified him, and set guards over him when buried. And he rose again on the
third day, while my soldiers were keeping guard. But so flagrant was the iniquity of the
Jews, that they gave money to my soldiers, saying, Say that his disciples have stolen his body.
But after receiving the money they could not keep secret what had been done; for they bore
witness both that he had risen again, that they had seen him,2004 and that they had received
money from the Jews.</p>
<p>This accordingly I have done, lest any one should give a different and a false account
of it, and lest thou shouldst think that the lies of the Jews are to be believed.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 (17).</head>
<p>Then Rabbi Addas, and Rabbi Finees, and Rabbi Egias, the three men who had come
from Galilee, testifying that they had seen Jesus taken up into heaven, rose up in the midst
of the multitude of the chiefs of the Jews, and said before the priests and the Levites, who
had been called together to the council of the Lord: When we were coming from Galilee,
we met at the Jordan a very great multitude of men, fathers2005 who had been some time
dead. And present among them we saw Karinus and Leucius. And they came up to us, and
we kissed each other, because they were dear friends of ours; and we asked them, Tell us,
friends and brothers, what is this breath of life and flesh? and who are those with whom you
are going? and how do you, who have been some time dead, remain in the body?</p>
<p>And they said in answer: We have risen again along with Christ from the lower world,
and He has raised us up again from the dead. And from this you may know that the gates
of death and darkness have been destroyed, and the souls of the saints have been brought
out thence, and have ascended into heaven along with Christ the Lord. And indeed to us
it has been commanded by the Lord Himself, that for an appointed time we should walk
over the banks of Jordan and the mountains; not, however, appearing to every one, nor
speaking to every one, except to those to whom He has permitted us. And just now we
could neither have spoken nor appeared to you, unless it had been allowed to us by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>And when they heard this, all the multitude who were present in the council were struck
with fear and trembling, and wondered whether these things had really happened which
these Galilæans testified. Then Caiaphas and Annas said to the council: What these have
testified, first and last, must shortly be altogether made clear: If it shall be found to be true
that Karinus and Leucius remain alive in the body, and if we shall be able to behold them
with our own eyes, then what they testify is altogether true; and if we find them, they will
inform us of everything; but if not, you may know that it is all lies.</p>
<p>Then the council having suddenly risen, it pleased them to choose men fit for the duty,
fearing God, and who knew when they died, and where they were buried, to inquire diligently,
and to see whether it was as they had heard. The men therefore proceeded to the same place,
fifteen in number, who through all were present at their falling asleep, and had stood at their
feet when they were buried, and had beheld their tombs. And they came and found their
tombs open, and very many others besides, and found a sign neither of their bones nor of
their dust. And they returned in all haste, and reported what they had seen.</p>
<note type="footnote">2005 Abbatorum.</note>

<pb n="1464"/>
<p>Then all their synagogue was in great grief and perplexity, and they said to each other:
What shall we do? Annas and Caiaphas said: Let us turn to where we have heard that they
are, and let us send to them men of rank, asking and entreating them: perhaps they will
deign to come to us. Then they sent to them Nicodemus and Joseph, and the three men,
the Galilæan rabbis who had seen them, asking that they should deign to come to them.
And they went, and walked round all the region of Jordan and of the mountains, and they
were coming back without finding them.</p>
<p>And, behold, suddenly there appeared coming down from Mount Amalech a very great
number, as it were, twelve thousand men, who had risen with the Lord. And though they
recognised very many there, they were not able to say anything to them for fear and the
angelic vision; and they stood at a distance gazing and hearing them, how they walked along
singing praises, and saying: The Lord has risen again from the dead, as He had said; let us
all exult and be glad, since He reigns for ever. Then those who had been sent were astonished,
and fell to the ground for fear, and received the answer from them, that they should see
Karinus and Leucius in their own houses.</p>
<p>And they rose up and went to their houses, and found them spending their time in
prayer. And going in to them, they fell on their faces to the ground, saluting them; and being
raised up, they said: O friends of God, all the multitude of the Jews have directed us to you,
hearing that you have risen from the dead, asking and beseeching you to come to them, that
we all may know the great things of God which have happened around us in our times.
And they immediately, at a sign from God, rose up, and came with them, and entered their
synagogue. Then the multitude of the Jews, with the priests, put the books of the law in
their hands, and adjured them by the God Heloi, and the God Adonai, and by the law and
the prophets, saying: Tell us how you have risen from the dead, and what are those wonderful
things which have happened in our times, such as we have never heard to have happened
at any other time; because already for fear all our bones have been benumbed, and have
dried up, and the earth moves itself under our feet: for we have joined all our hearts to shed
righteous and holy blood.</p>
<p>Then Karinus and Leucius signed to them with their hands to give them a sheet of paper
and ink. And this they did, because the Holy Spirit did not allow them to speak to them.
And they gave each of them paper, and put them apart, the one from the other in separate
cells. And they, making with their fingers the sign of the cross of Christ, began to write on
the separate sheets; and after they had finished, as if out of one mouth from the separate
cells, they cried out, Amen. And rising up, Karinus gave his paper to Annas, and Leucius
to Caiaphas; and saluting each other, they went out, and returned to their sepulchres.
Then Annas and Caiaphas, opening the sheet of paper, began each to read it in secret.</p>
<p>But all the people took it ill, and so all cried out: Read these writings to us openly; and after
they have been read through we shall keep them, lest perchance this truth of God be turned

<pb n="1466"/>
through wilful blindness, by unclean and deceitful men, into falsehood. At this Annas and
Caiaphas fell a-trembling, and delivered the sheet of paper to Rabbi Addas, and Rabbi Finees,
and Rabbi Egias, who had come from Galilee, and announced that Jesus had been taken up
into heaven. All the multitude of the Jews trusted to them to read this writing. And they
read the paper containing these words:—</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1467"/>
<head>Chapter 2 (18).</head>
<p>I Karinus. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, permit me to speak of Thy wonders
which Thou hast done in the lower world. When, therefore, we were kept in darkness and
the shadow of death in the lower world, suddenly there shone upon us a great light, and
Hades and the gates of death trembled. And then was heard the voice of the Son of the
Father most high, as if the voice of a great thunder; and loudly proclaiming, He thus charged
them: Lift up your gates, ye princes; lift up the everlasting gates; the King of glory, Christ
the Lord, will come up to enter in.</p>
<p>Then Satan, the leader of death, came up, fleeing in terror, saying to his officers and the
powers below: My officers, and all the powers below, run together, shut your gates, put up
the iron bars, and fight bravely, and resist, lest they lay hold of us, and keep us captive in
chains. Then all his impious officers were perplexed, and began to shut the gates of death
with all diligence, and by little and little to fasten the locks and the iron bars, and to hold
all their weapons2006 grasped in their hands, and to utter howlings in a direful and most
hideous voice.</p>

<pb n="1468"/>
<head>Chapter 3 (19).</head>
<p>Then Satan said to Hades: Make thyself ready to receive him whom I shall bring down
to thee. Thereupon Hades thus replied to Satan: That voice was from nothing else than the
cry of the Son of the Father most high, because the earth and all the places of the world below
so trembled under it: wherefore I think that myself and all my dungeons are now lying
open. But I adjure thee, Satan, head of all evils,2007 by thy power and my own, bring him
not to me, lest, while we wish to take him, we be taken captive by him. For if, at his voice
only, all my power has been thus destroyed, what do you think he will do when he shall
come in person?</p>
<p>To him Satan, the leader of death, thus replied: What art thou crying out about? Do
not be afraid, my old most wicked friend, because I have stirred up the people of the Jews
against him; I have told them to strike him with blows on the face, and I have brought upon
him betrayal by one of his disciples; and he is a man in great fear of death, because from
fear he said, My soul is sorrowful, even unto death; and I have brought him to this, that he
has just been lifted up and hanged on the cross.</p>
<p>Then Hades said to him: If he be the same who, by the mere word of his command,
made Lazarus fly away like an eagle from my bosom, when he had already been dead four
days, he is not a man in humanity, but God in majesty. I entreat thee not to bring him to
me. And Satan says to him: Make thyself ready nevertheless; be not afraid; because he is
already hanging on the cross, I can do nothing else. Then Hades thus replied to Satan: If,
then, thou canst do nothing else, behold, thy destruction is at hand. I, in short, shall remain
cast down and dishonoured; thou, however, wilt be tortured under my power.</p>

<p>And the saints of God heard the wrangling of Satan and Hades. They, however, though
as yet not at all recognising each other, were, notwithstanding, in the possession of their
faculties. But our holy father Adam thus replied to Satan at once: O captain of death, why
dost thou fear and tremble? Behold, the Lord is coming, who will now destroy all thy inventions;
and thou shalt be taken by Him, and bound throughout eternity.</p>
<p>Then all the saints, hearing the voice of our father Adam, how boldly he replied to Satan
in all points, were strengthened in joy; and all running together to father Adam, were crowded
in one place. Then our father Adam, gazing on all that multitude, wondered greatly
whether all of them had been begotten from him into the world. And embracing those who
were standing everywhere around him, and shedding most bitter tears, he addressed his son
Seth, saying: Relate, my son Seth, to the holy patriarchs and prophets what the guardian of
paradise said to thee, when I sent thee to bring to me of that oil of compassion, in order to
anoint my body when I was ill.</p>
<p>Then he answered: I, when thou sentest me before the gates of paradise, prayed and
entreated the Lord with tears, and called upon the guardian of paradise to give me of it
therefrom. Then Michael the archangel came out, and said to me, Seth, why then dost thou
weep? Know, being informed beforehand, that thy father Adam will not receive of this oil
of compassion now, but after many generations of time. For the most beloved Son of God
will come down from heaven into the world, and will be baptized by John in the river Jordan;
and then shall thy father Adam receive of this oil2008 of compassion, and all that believe in
him. And of those who have believed in him, their kingdom will endure for ever.</p>

<p>Then all the saints, hearing this again, exulted in joy. And one of those standing round,
Isaias by name, cried out aloud, and thundered: Father Adam, and all standing round, hear
my declaration. When I was on earth, and by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, in prophecy
I sang of this light: The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; to them dwelling
in the region of the shadow of death light has arisen. At these words father Adam, and all
of them, turned and asked him: Who art thou? because what thou sayest is true. And he
subjoined, and said: My name is Isaias.</p>
<p>Then appeared another near him, as if a hermit. And they asked him, saying: Who art
thou, who bearest such an appearance in thy body?2009 And he firmly answered: I am John
the Baptist, voice and prophet of the Most High. I went before the face of the same Lord,
that I might make the waste and rough places into plain ways. I with my finger pointed out
and made manifest the Lamb of the Lord, and Son of God, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
I baptized Him in the river Jordan. I heard the voice of the Father from heaven thundering
over Him, and proclaiming, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. I received
from Him the answer that He would descend to the lower world</p>
<p>Then father Adam, hearing this, cried with a loud voice, exclaiming: Alleluia! which
is, interpreted, The Lord is certainly coming.</p>

<p>After that, another standing there, pre-eminent as it were, with a certain mark of an
emperor, David by name, thus cried out, and said: When I was upon earth, I made revelations
to the people of the mercy of God and His visitation, prophesying future joys, saying through
all ages, Let them make confession to the Lord of His tender mercy and His wonderful works
to the sons of men, because He has shattered the gates of brass, and broken the bars of iron.
Then the holy patriarchs and prophets began mutually to recognise each other, and each to
quote his prophecies.</p>
<p>Then holy Jeremias, examining his prophecies, said to the patriarchs and prophets:
When I was upon earth, I prophesied of the Son of God, that He was seen upon earth, and
dwelt with men.</p>
<p>Then all the saints, exulting in the light of the Lord, and in the sight of father Adam,
and in the answering of all the patriarchs and prophets, cried out, saying: Alleluia! blessed
is He who cometh in the name of the Lord; so that at their crying out Satan trembled, and
sought a way of escape. And he could not, because Hades and his satellites kept him bound
in the lower regions, and guarded at all points. And they said to him: Why dost thou
tremble? We by no means allow thee to go forth hence. But receive this, as thou art worthy,
from Him whom thou didst daily assail; but if not, know that thou, bound by Him, shall be
in my keeping.</p>

<p>And again there came the voice of the Son of the Father most high, as it were the voice
of a great thunder, saying: Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
gates, and the King of glory will come in. Then Satan and Hades cried out, saying: Who is
the king of glory? And it was answered to them in the voice of the Lord: The Lord strong
and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.</p>
<p>After this voice there came a man, whose appearance was that of a robber, carrying a
cross on his shoulder, crying from the outside of the door, and saying: Open to me, that I
may come in. And Satan, opening to him a little, brought him inside into his dwelling,2010
and again shut the door after him. And all the saints saw him most clearly, and said to him
forthwith: Thy appearance is that of a robber. Tell us what it is that thou carriest on thy
back. And he answered, and said with humility: Truly I was a robber altogether; and the
Jews hung me up on a cross, along with my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father most
high. I, in fine, have come heralding2011 Him; He indeed is coming immediately behind
me.</p>
<p>Then holy David, inflamed with anger against Satan, cried out aloud: Open thy gates,
most vile wretch, that the King of glory may come in. In like manner also all the saints of
God rose up against Satan, and would have seized him, and divided him among them. And
again a cry was heard within: Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
gates; and the King of glory shall come in. Hades and Satan, at that clear voice, again asked,
saying: Who is this king of glory? And it was said to them by that wonderful voice: The
Lord of powers, He is the King of glory.</p>

open. And Satan remained in the midst, and stood confounded and downcast, bound with
fetters on his feet. And, behold, the Lord Jesus Christ, coming in the brightness of light
from on high, compassionate, great, and lowly, carrying a chain in His hand, bound Satan
by the neck; and again tying his hands behind him, dashed him on his back into Tartarus,
and placed His holy foot on his throat, saying: Through all ages thou hast done many evils;
thou hast not in any wise rested. To-day I deliver thee to everlasting fire. And Hades being
suddenly summoned, He commanded him, and said: Take this most wicked and impious
one, and have him in thy keeping even to that day in which I shall command thee. And he,
as soon as he received him, was plunged under the feet of the Lord along with him into the

<p>Then all the saints, adoring Him, cried out, saying: Blessed is He who cometh in the
name of the Lord! The Lord God hath shone upon us—amen—through all ages. Alleluia
for ever and ever! Praise, honour, power, glory! because Thou hast come from on high to
visit us. Singing Alleluia continually, and rejoicing together concerning His glory, they ran
together under the hands of the Lord. Then the Saviour, inquiring thoroughly about all,
seized Hades,2012 immediately threw some down into Tartarus, and led some with Him to
the upper world.</p>

<p>Then all the saints of God asked the Lord to leave as a sign of victory the sign of His
holy cross in the lower world, that its most impious officers might not retain as an offender
any one whom the Lord had absolved. And so it was done. And the Lord set His cross in
the midst of Hades, which is the sign of victory, and which will remain even to eternity.
Then we all went forth thence along with the Lord, leaving Satan and Hades in Tartarus.
And to us and many others it was commanded that we should rise in the body, giving in
the world a testimony of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of those things which
had been done in the lower world.</p>

weeping bitterly, and cruelly beating their breasts, crying out, and saying through all: Woe
to us! Why has this happened to us wretched? Pilate flees; Annas and Caiaphas flee; the
priests and Levites flee; moreover also the people of the Jews, weeping and saying, Woe to
us wretched! we have shed sacred blood upon the earth.</p>
<p>For three days, therefore, and three nights, they did not taste bread and water at all; nor
did any of them return to the synagogue. But on the third day again the council was assembled,
and the other paper of Leucius was read through; and it was found neither more
nor less, to a single letter, than that which the writing of Karinus contained. Then the synagogue
was perplexed; and they all lamented forty days and forty nights, looking for destruction
from God, and the vengeance of God. But He, pitier affectionate and most high, did
not immediately destroy them, bountifully giving them a place of repentance. But they were
not found worthy to be turned to the Lord.</p>
<p>These are the testimonies of Karinus and Leucius, dearest brethren, concerning Christ
the Son of God, and His holy deeds in the lower world; to whom let us all give praise and
glory through immeasurable age of ages. Amen.</p>

<head>The Letter of Pontius Pilate,
Which He Wrote to the Roman Emperor, Concerning Our Lord Jesus
Christ.</head>
<p>Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Cæsar the emperor, greeting.2013</p>
<p>Upon Jesus Christ, whose case I had clearly set forth to thee in my last, at length by the
will of the people a bitter punishment has been inflicted, myself being in a sort unwilling
and rather afraid. A man, by Hercules, so pious and strict, no age has ever had nor will
have. But wonderful were the efforts of the people themselves, and the unanimity of all the
scribes and chief men and elders, to crucify this ambassador of truth, notwithstanding that
their own prophets, and after our manner the sibyls, warned them against it: and supernatural
signs appeared while he was hanging, and, in the opinion of philosophers, threatened
destruction to the whole world. His disciples are flourishing, in their work and the regulation
of their lives not belying their master; yea, in his name most beneficent. Had I not been
afraid of the rising of a sedition among the people, who were just on the point of breaking
out, perhaps this man would still have been alive to us; although, urged more by fidelity to
thy dignity than induced by my own wishes, I did not according to my strength resist that
innocent blood free from the whole charge brought against it, but unjustly, through the
malignity of men, should be sold and suffer, yet, as the Scriptures signify, to their own destruction.
Farewell. 28th March.</p>

<head>The Report of Pilate the Procurator Concerning Our Lord
Jesus Christ.</head>
<head>Sent to the August2014 Cæsar in Rome.</head>
<head>First Greek Form.</head>
<p>In those days, our Lord Jesus Christ having been crucified under Pontius Pilate, procurator
of Palestine and Phoenicia, these records were made in Jerusalem as to what was done
by the Jews against the Lord. Pilate therefore, along with his private report, sent them to
the Cæsar in Rome, writing thus:—</p>
<p>To the most mighty, venerable, most divine, and most terrible, the august2015 Cæsar,
Pilate the governor of the East sends greeting. I have, O most mighty, a narrative to give
thee, on account of which I am seized with fear and trembling. For in this government of
mine, of which one of the cities is called Jerusalem, all the people of the Jews have delivered
to me a man named Jesus, bringing many charges against him, which they were not able to
convict him of by the consistency of their evidence. And one of the heresies they had against
him was, that Jesus said that their Sabbath should not be a day of leisure, and should not be
observed. For he performed many cures on that day: he made the blind receive their sight,
the lame walk; he raised up the dead, he cleansed the lepers; he healed paralytics that were
not at all able to make any movement of their body, or to keep their nerves steady, but who
had only speech and the modulation of their voice, and he gave them the power of walking
and running, removing their illness by a single word. Another thing again, more powerful
still, which is strange even with our gods: he raised up one that had been dead four days,
summoning him by a single word, when the dead man had his blood corrupted, and when
his body was destroyed by the worms produced in it, and when it had the stink of a dog.
And seeing him lying in the tomb, he ordered him to run. Nor had he anything of a dead
body about him at all; but as a bridegroom from the bridal chamber, so he came forth from
the tomb filled with very great fragrance. And strangers that were manifestly demoniac,
and that had their dwelling in deserts, and ate their own flesh, living like beasts and creeping
things, even these he made to be dwellers in cities, and by his word restored them to
soundness of mind, and rendered them wise and able and reputable, eating with all the enemies
of the unclean spirits that dwelt in them for their destruction, which he cast down

into the depths of the sea. And again there was another having a withered hand; and not
the hand only, but rather the half of the body of the man, was petrified, so that he had not
the form of a man, or the power of moving his body. And him by a word he healed, and
made sound. And a woman that had an issue of blood for many years, and whose joints2016
and veins were drained by the flowing of the blood, so that she did not present the appearance
of a human being, but was like a corpse, and was speechless every day, so that all the physicians
of the district could not cure her. For there was not any hope of life left to her. And
when Jesus passed by, she mysteriously received strength through his overshadowing her;
and she took hold of his fringe behind, and immediately in the same hour power filled up
what in her was empty, so that, no longer suffering any pain, she began to run swiftly to her
own city Kepharnaum, so as to accomplish the journey in six days.</p>
<p>And these are the things which I lately had in my mind to report, which Jesus accomplished
on the Sabbath. And other signs greater than these he did, so that I have perceived
that the wonderful works done by him are greater than can be done by the gods whom we
worship.</p>
<p>And him Herod and Archelaus and Philip, Annas and Caiaphas, with all the people,
delivered to me, making a great uproar against me that I should try him. I therefore ordered
him to be crucified, having first scourged him, and having found against him no cause of
evil accusations or deeds.</p>
<p>And at the time he was crucified there was darkness over all the world, the sun being
darkened at mid-day, and the stars appearing, but in them there appeared no lustre; and
the moon, as if turned into blood, failed in her light. And the world was swallowed up by
the lower regions, so that the very sanctuary of the temple, as they call it, could not be seen
by the Jews in their fall; and they saw below them a chasm of the earth, with the roar of the
thunders that fell upon it.2017 And in that terror dead men were seen that had risen, as the
Jews themselves testified; and they said that it was Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the
twelve patriarchs, and Moses and Job, that had died, as they say, three thousand five hundred
years before. And there were very many whom I also saw appearing in the body; and they
were making a lamentation about the Jews, on account of the wickedness that had come to
pass through them, and the destruction of the Jews and of their law.</p>
<p>And the fear of the earthquake remained from the sixth hour of the preparation until
the ninth hour. And on the evening of the first day of the week there was a sound out of
the heaven, so that the heaven became enlightened sevenfold more than all the days. And
at the third hour of the night also the sun was seen brighter than it had ever shone before,

lighting up all the heaven. And as lightnings come suddenly in winter, so majestic men
appeared2018 in glorious robes, an innumerable multitude, whose voice was heard as that
of a very great thunder, crying out: Jesus that was crucified is risen: come up out of Hades,
ye that have been enslaved in the underground regions of Hades. And the chasm of the
earth was as if it had no bottom; but it was as if the very foundations of the earth appeared
along with those that cried out in the heavens, and walked about in the body in the midst
of the dead that had risen. And he that raised up all the dead, and bound Hades, said: Say
to my disciples, He goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him.</p>
<p>And all that night the light did not cease shining. And many of the Jews died, swallowed
up in the chasm of the earth, so that on the following day most of those who had been against
Jesus could not be found. Others saw the appearing of those that had risen, whom no one
of us had ever seen.2019 And only one2020 synagogue of the Jews was left in this Jerusalem,
since all disappeared in that fall.</p>
<p>With that terror, being in perplexity, and seized with a most frightful trembling, I have
written what I saw at that time, and have reported to thy majesty. Having set in order also
what was done by the Jews against Jesus, I have sent it, my lord, to thy divinity.</p>

<head>The Report of Pontius Pilate, Procurator of Judæa,
Sent to Rome to Tiberius Cæsar.</head>
<head>Second Greek Form.</head>
<p>To the most mighty, venerable, awful, most divine, the august,—Pilatus Pontius, the
governor of the East: I have to report to thy reverence, through this writing of mine, being
seized with great trembling and fear, O most mighty emperor, the conjuncture of the present
times, as the end of these things has shown. For while I, my lord, according to the commandment
of thy clemency, was discharging the duties of my government, which is one of the
cities of the East, Jerusalem by name, in which is built the temple of the Jewish nation, all
the multitude of the Jews came together, and delivered to me a certain man named Jesus,
bringing against him many and groundless charges; and they were not able to convict him
in anything. And one heresy of theirs against him was, that he said that the Sabbath was
not their right rest. And that man wrought many cures, in addition to good works. He
made the blind see; he cleansed lepers; he raised the dead; he healed paralytics who could
not move at all, except that they only had their voice, and the joining of their bones; and he
gave them the power of walking about and running, commanding them by a single word.
And another mightier work he did, which was strange even with our gods: he raised up a
dead man, Lazarus, who had been dead four days, by a single word ordering the dead man
to be raised, although his body was already corrupted by the worms that grow in wounds;
and that ill-smelling body lying in the tomb he ordered to run; and as a bridegroom from
the bridal chamber, so he came forth out of the tomb, filled with exceeding fragrance. And
some that were cruelly vexed by demons, and had their dwellings in deserts, and ate the
flesh of their own limbs, and lived along with reptiles and wild beasts, he made to be dwellers
in cities in their own houses, and by a word he rendered them sound-minded; and he made
those that were troubled by unclean spirits to be intelligent and reputable; and sending away
the demons in them into a herd of swine, he suffocated them in the sea. Another man,
again, who had a withered hand, and lived in sorrow, and had not even the half of his body
sound, he rendered sound by a single word. And a woman that had a flow of blood for
many years, so that, in consequence of the flowing of her blood, all the joinings of her bones
appeared, and were transparent like glass; and assuredly all the physicians had left her
without hope, and had not cleansed her, for there was not in her a single hope of health:
once, then, as Jesus was passing by, she took hold of the fringe of his clothes behind, and

<pb n="1482"/>
that same hour the power of her body was completely restored, and she became whole, as
if nothing were the matter with her, and she began to run swiftly to her own city Paneas.2021</p>
<p>And these things indeed were so. And the Jews gave information that Jesus did these
things on the Sabbath. And I also ascertained that the miracles done by him were greater
than any which the gods whom we worship could do.</p>
<p>Him then Herod and Archelaus and Philip, and Annas and Caiaphas, with all the people,
delivered to me to try him. And as many were exciting an insurrection against me, I ordered
him to be crucified.</p>
<p>And when he had been crucified, there was darkness over the whole earth, the sun
having been completely hidden, and the heaven appearing dark though it was day, so that
the stars appeared, but had at the same time their brightness darkened, as I suppose your
reverence is not ignorant of, because in all the world they lighted lamps from the sixth hour
until evening. And the moon, being like blood, did not shine the whole night, and yet she
happened to be at the full. And the stars also, and Orion, made a lament about the Jews, on
account of the wickedness that had been done by them.2022</p>
<p>And on the first of the week, about the third hour of the night, the sun was seen such
as it had never at any time shone, and all the heaven was lighted up. And as lightnings come
on in winter, so majestic men of indescribable splendour of dress and of glory appeared in
the air, and an innumerable multitude of angels crying out, and saying: Glory in the highest
to God, and on earth peace, among men goodwill: come up out of Hades, ye who have been
kept in slavery in the underground regions of Hades. And at their voice all the mountains
and hills were shaken, and the rocks were burst asunder; and great chasms were made in
the earth, so that also what was in the abyss appeared.</p>
<p>And there were seen in that terror dead men raised up,2023 as the Jews that saw them
said: We have seen Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve patriarchs, that died two
thousand five hundred years ago; and we have seen Noah manifestly in the body. And all
the multitude walked about, and sang praises to God with aloud voice, saying: The Lord
our God that has risen from the dead has brought to life all the dead, and has plundered
Hades, and put him to death.</p>
<note type="footnote">2021 This is a conjecture of Thilo’s. Themss. have Spania.</note>
<note type="footnote">2022 Instead of this last sentence, one of the mss. has: And the whole world was shaken by unspeakable

temple was rent from top to bottom. And again there was thunder, and a mighty noise from heaven, so that all
our land shook and trembled. Another: And there began to be earthquakes in the hour in which the nails were
fixed in Jesus’ hands and feet, until evening.</note>

<p>All that night therefore, my lord, O king, the light ceased not. And many of the Jews
died, and were engulphed and swallowed up in the chasms in that night, so that not even
their bodies appeared. Those, I say, of the Jews suffered that had spoken against Jesus. And
one synagogue was left in Jerusalem, since all those synagogues that had been against Jesus
were engulphed.</p>
<p>From that fear, then, being in perplexity, and seized with much trembling, at that same
hour I ordered what had been done by them all to be written; and I have reported it to thy
mightiness.</p>

<head>The Giving Up of Pontius Pilate.</head>
<p>And the writings having come to the city of the Romans, and having been read to the
Cæsar, with not a few standing by, all were astounded, because through the wickedness of
Pilate the darkness and the earthquake had come over the whole world. And the Cæsar,
filled with rage, sent soldiers, and ordered them to bring Pilate a prisoner.</p>
<p>And when he was brought to the city of the Romans, the Cæsar, hearing that Pilate had
arrived, sat in the temple of the gods, in the presence of all the senate, and with all the army,
and all the multitude of his power; and he ordered Pilate to stand forward.2024 And the
Cæsar says to him: Why hast thou, O most impious, dared to do such things, having seen
so great miracles in that man? By daring to do an evil deed, thou hast destroyed the whole
world.</p>
<p>And Pilate said: O almighty2025 king, I am innocent of these things; but the multitude
of the Jews are violent and guilty. And the Cæsar said: And who are they? Pilate says:
Herod, Archelaus, Philip, Annas and Caiaphas, and all the multitude of the Jews. The Cæsar
says: For what reason didst thou follow out their counsel? And Pilate says: Their nation
is rebellious and insubmissive, not submitting themselves to thy power. And the Cæsar
said: When they delivered him to thee, thou oughtest to have made him secure, and to have
sent him to me, and not to have obeyed them in crucifying such a man, righteous as he was,
and one that did such good miracles, as thou hast said in thy report. For from such miracles
Jesus was manifestly the Christ, the King of the Jews.</p>
<p>And as the Cæsar was thus speaking, when he named the name of Christ, all the multitude
of the gods fell down in a body, and became as dust, where the Cæsar was sitting with
the senate. And the people standing beside the Cæsar all began to tremble, on account of
the speaking of the word, and the fall of their gods; and being seized with terror, they all
went away, each to his own house, wondering at what had happened. And the Cæsar ordered
Pilate to be kept in security, in order that he might know the truth about Jesus.</p>
<p>And on the following day, the Cæsar, sitting in the Capitol with all the senate, tried
again to question Pilate. And the Cæsar says: Tell the truth, O most impious, because
through thy impious action which thou hast perpetrated against Jesus, even here the doing
of thy wicked deeds has been shown by the gods having been cast down. Say, then, who is
he that has been crucified; because even his name has destroyed all the gods? Pilate said:
And indeed the records of him are true; for assuredly I myself was persuaded from his works
that he was greater than all the gods whom we worship. And the Cæsar said: For what
<note type="footnote">2024 Or, in the entrance.</note>
<note type="footnote">2025 αὐτοκράτωρ.</note>

<pb n="1485"/>
reason, then, didst thou bring against him such audacity and such doings, if thou wert not
ignorant of him, and altogether devising mischief against my kingdom? Pilate said: On
account of the wickedness and rebellion of the lawless and ungodly Jews, I did this.</p>
<p>And the Cæsar, being filled with rage, held a council with all his senate and his power,
and ordered a decree to be written against the Jews as follows:—To Licianus, the governor
of the chief places of the East, greeting. The reckless deed which has been done at the present
time by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the cities of the Jews round about, and their wicked
action, has come to my knowledge, that they have forced Pilate to crucify a certain god
named Jesus, and on account of this great fault of theirs the world has been darkened and
dragged to destruction. Do thou then speedily, with a multitude of soldiers, go to them
there, and make them prisoners, in accordance with this decree. Be obedient, and take action
against them, and scatter them, and make them slaves among all the nations; and having
driven them out of the whole of Judæa, make them the smallest of nations, so that it may
not any longer be seen at all, because they are full of wickedness.2026</p>
<p>And this decree having come into the region of the East, Licianus, obeying from fear of
the decree, seized all the nation of the Jews; and those that were left in Judæa he scattered
among the nations, and sold for slaves:2027 so that it was known to the Cæsar that these
things had been done by Licianus against the Jews in the region of the East; and it pleased
him.</p>
<p>And again the Cæsar set himself to question Pilate; and he orders a captain named Albius
to cut off Pilate’s head, saying: Just as he laid hands upon the just man named Christ,
in like manner also shall he fall, and not find safety.</p>
<p>And Pilate, going away to the place, prayed in silence, saying: Lord, do not destroy me
along with the wicked Hebrews, because I would not have laid hands upon Thee, except for
the nation of the lawless Jews, because they were exciting rebellion against me. But Thou
knowest that I did it in ignorance. Do not then destroy me for this my sin; but remember
not evil against me, O Lord, and against Thy servant Procla, who is standing with me in this
the hour of my death, whom Thou didst appoint to prophesy that Thou shouldest be nailed
to the cross. Do not condemn her also in my sin; but pardon us, and make us to be numbered
in the portion of Thy righteous.</p>
<p>And, behold, when Pilate had finished his prayer, there came a voice out of the heaven,
saying: All the generations and families of the nations shall count thee blessed, because
under thee have been fulfilled all those things said about me by the prophets; and thou
thyself shall be seen as my witness at my second appearing, when I shall judge the twelve
tribes of Israel, and those that have not owned my name. And the prefect struck off the

head of Pilate; and, behold, an angel of the Lord received it. And his wife Procla, seeing the
angel coming and receiving his head, being filled with joy herself also, immediately gave up
the ghost, and was buried along with her husband.2028</p>

<head>The Death of Pilate, Who Condemned Jesus.</head>
<p>And when Tiberius Cæsar, the emperor of the Romans, was labouring under a grievous
disease, and understanding that there was at Jerusalem a certain physician, Jesus by name,
who by a single word cured all infirmities, he, not knowing that the Jews and Pilate had put
Him to death, ordered a certain friend of his named Volusianus: Go as quickly as possible
across the seas; and thou shalt tell Pilate, my servant and friend, to send me this physician,
that he may restore me to my former health. And this Volusianus, having heard the emperor’s
command, immediately departed, and came to Pilate, as he had been commanded. And
he related to the same Pilate what had been entrusted to him by Tiberius Cæsar, saying:
Tiberius Cæsar, the emperor of the Romans, thy master, having heard that in this city there
is a physician who by his word alone heals infirmities, begs thee earnestly to send him to
him for the curing of his infirmity. Pilate, hearing this, was very much afraid, knowing that
through envy he had caused Him to be put to death. Pilate answered the same messenger
thus, saying: This man was a malefactor, and a man who drew to himself all the people; so
a council of the wise men of the city was held, and I caused him to be crucified. And this
messenger returning to his inn, met a certain woman named Veronica, who had been a
friend of Jesus; and he said: O woman, a certain physician who was in this city, who cured
the sick by a word alone, why have the Jews put him to death? And she began to weep,
saying: Ah me! my lord, my God and my Lord, whom Pilate for envy delivered, condemned,
and ordered to be crucified. Then he, being exceedingly grieved, said: I am vehemently
grieved that I am unable to accomplish that for which my lord had sent me. And Veronica
said to him: When my Lord was going about preaching, and I, much against my will, was
deprived of His presence, I wished His picture to be painted for me, in order that, while I
was deprived of His presence, the figure of His picture might at least afford me consolation.
And when I was carrying the canvas to the painter to be painted, my Lord met me, and
asked whither I was going. And when I had disclosed to Him the cause of my journey, He
asked of me the cloth, and gave it back to me impressed with the image of His venerable
face. Therefore, if thy lord will devoutly gaze upon His face,2029 he shall obtain forthwith
the benefit of health. And he said to her: Is a picture of such a sort procurable by gold or
silver? She said to him: No; but by the pious influence of devotion. I shall therefore set out
with thee, and shall carry the picture to be seen by Cæsar, and shall come back again.</p>
<p>Volusianus therefore came with Veronica to Rome, and said to Tiberius the emperor:
Jesus, whom thou hast been longing for, Pilate and the Jews have delivered to an unjust
death, and have through envy affixed to the gibbet of the cross. There has therefore come
<note type="footnote">2029 Or, upon the sight of this.</note>

<pb n="1488"/>
with me a certain matron, bringing a picture of Jesus himself; and if thou wilt devoutly look
upon it, thou shalt immediately obtain the benefit of thy health. Cæsar therefore ordered
the way to be strewn with silk cloths, and the picture to be presented to him; and as soon
as he had looked upon it, he regained his former health.</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate, therefore, by the command of Cæsar, is taken and brought through to
Rome. Cæsar, hearing that Pilate had arrived at Rome, was filled with exceeding fury against
him, and caused him to be brought to him. But Pilate brought down with him the seamless
tunic of Jesus; and he wore it on him in presence of the emperor. And as soon as the emperor
saw him, he laid aside all his anger, and forthwith rose up to meet him. Nor was he able to
speak harshly to him in anything; and he who seemed so terrible and fierce in his absence,
now in his presence is somehow found to be mild. And when he had sent him away, immediately
he blazed out against him terribly, crying out that he was a wretch, inasmuch as he
had not at all shown him the fury of his heart. And immediately he made him be called
back, swearing and declaring that he was the son of death, and that it was infamous that he
should live upon the earth. And as soon as he saw him, he forthwith saluted him, and threw
away all the ferocity of his mind. All wondered; and he himself wondered that he should
thus blaze out against Pilate when he was absent, and that while he was present he could
say nothing to him roughly. Then, by a divine impulse, or perhaps by the advice of some
Christian,2030 he caused him to be stripped of that tunic, and immediately resumed against
him his former ferocity of mind. And when at this the emperor wondered very much, it
was told him that that tunic had belonged to the Lord Jesus. Then the emperor ordered
him to be kept in prison, until he should deliberate in a council of the wise men what ought
to be done with him. And a few days after, sentence was therefore passed upon Pilate, that
he should be condemned to the most disgraceful death. Pilate, hearing this, killed himself
with his own knife, and by such a death ended his life.</p>
<p>When Cæsar knew of the death of Pilate, he said: Truly he has died by a most disgraceful
death, whom his own hand has not spared. He is therefore bound to a great mass, and sunk
into the river Tiber. But malignant and filthy spirits in his malignant and filthy body, all
rejoicing together, kept moving themselves in the waters, and in a terrible manner brought
lightnings and tempests, thunders and hail-storms, in the air, so that all men were kept in
horrible fear. Wherefore the Romans, drawing him out of the river Tiber, in derision carried
him down to Vienna, and sunk him in the river Rhone. For Vienna is called, as it were, Via
Gehennæ, the way of Gehenna, because it was then a place of cursing. But there evil spirits
were present, working the same things in the same place. Those men therefore, not enduring
such a visitation of demons, removed from themselves that vessel of malediction, and sent

him to be buried in the territory of Losania.2031 And they, seeing that they were troubled
by the aforesaid visitations, removed him from themselves, and sunk him in a certain pit
surrounded by mountains, where to this day, according to the account of some, certain
diabolical machinations are said to bubble up.</p>

Which Also He Brings In the Cases of the Two Robbers.</head>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>I am Joseph of Arimathæa, who begged from Pilate the body of the Lord Jesus for
burial, and who for this cause was kept close in prison by the murderous and God-fighting2032
Jews, who also, keeping to the law, have by Moses himself become partakers in tribulation
and having provoked their Lawgiver to anger, and not knowing that He was God, crucified
Him and made Him manifest to those that knew God. In those days in which they condemned
the Son of God to be crucified, seven days before Christ suffered, two condemned
robbers were sent from Jericho to the procurator Pilate; and their case was as follows:—</p>
<p>The first, his name Gestas, put travellers to death, murdering them with the sword, and
others he exposed naked. And he hung up women by the heels, head down, and cut off
their breasts, and drank the blood of infants limbs, never having known God, not obeying
the laws, being violent from the beginning, and doing such deeds.</p>
<p>And the case of the other was as follows: He was called Demas, and was by birth a Galilæan,
and kept an inn. He made attacks upon the rich, but was good to the poor—a thief
like Tobit, for he buried the bodies of the poor.2033 And he set his hand to robbing the
multitude of the Jews, and stole the law2034 itself in Jerusalem, and stripped naked the
daughter of Caiaphas, who was priestess of the sanctuary, and took away from its place the
mysterious deposit itself placed there by Solomon. Such were his doings.</p>
<p>And Jesus also was taken on the third day before the passover, in the evening. And to
Caiaphas and the multitude of the Jews it was not a passover, but it was a great mourning
to them, on account of the plundering of the sanctuary by the robber. And they summoned
Judas Iscariot, and spoke to him, for he was son of the brother2035 of Caiaphas the priest.</p>

<p>He was not a disciple before the face of Jesus; but all the multitude of the Jews craftily supported
him, that he might follow Jesus, not that he might be obedient to the miracles done
by Him, nor that he might confess Him, but that he might betray Him to them, wishing to
catch up some lying word of Him, giving him gifts for such brave, honest conduct to the
amount of a half shekel of gold each day. And he did this for two years with Jesus, as says
one of His disciples called John.</p>
<p>And on the third day, before Jesus was laid hold of, Judas says to the Jews: Come, let
us hold a council; for perhaps it was not the robber that stole the law, but Jesus himself, and
I accuse him. And when these words had been spoken, Nicodemus, who kept the keys of
the sanctuary, came in to us, and said to all: Do not do such a deed. For Nicodemus was
true, more than all the multitude of the Jews. And the daughter of Caiaphas, Sarah by name,
cried out, and said: He himself said before all against this holy place, I am able to destroy
this temple, and in three days to raise it. The Jews say to her: Thou hast credit with all of
us. For they regarded her as a prophetess. And assuredly, after the council had been held,
Jesus was laid hold of.</p>

<p>And on the following day, the fourth day of the week, they brought Him at the ninth
hour into the hall of Caiaphas. And Annas and Caiaphas say to Him: Tell us, why hast thou
stolen our law, and renounced2036 the ordinances of Moses and the prophets? And Jesus
answered nothing. And again a second time, the multitude also being present, they say to
Him: The sanctuary which Solomon built in forty and six years, why dost thou wish to
destroy in one moment? And to these things Jesus answered nothing. For the sanctuary of
the synagogue had been plundered by the robber.</p>
<p>And the evening of the fourth day being ended, all the multitude sought to burn the
daughter of Caiaphas, on account of the loss of the law; for they did not know how they
were to keep the passover. And she said to them: Wait, my children, and let us destroy this
Jesus, and the law will be found, and the holy feast will be fully accomplished. And secretly
Annas and Caiaphas gave considerable money to Judas Iscariot, saying: Say as thou saidst
to us before, I know that the law has been stolen by Jesus, that the accusation may be turned
against him, and not against this maiden, who is free from blame. And Judas having received
this command, said to them: Let not all the multitude know that I have been instructed by
you to do this against Jesus; but release Jesus, and I persuade the multitude that it is so. And
craftily they released Jesus.</p>
<p>And Judas, going into the sanctuary at the dawn of the fifth day, says to all the people:
What will you give me, and I will give up to you the overthrower2037 of the law, and the
plunderer of the prophets? The Jews say to him: If thou wilt give him up to us, we will give
thee thirty pieces of gold. And the people did not know that Judas was speaking about Jesus,
for many of them confessed that he was the Son of God. And Judas received the thirty pieces
of gold.</p>
<p>And going out at the fourth hour, and at the fifth, he finds Jesus walking in the street.
And as evening was coming on, Judas says to the Jews: Give me the aid of soldiers with
swords and staves, and I will give him up to you. They therefore gave him officers for the
purpose of seizing Him. And as they were going along, Judas says to them: Lay hold of the
man whom I shall kiss, for he has stolen the law and the prophets. Going up to Jesus,
therefore, he kissed Him, saying: Hail, Rabbi! it being the evening of the fifth day. And
having laid hold of Him, they gave Him up to Caiaphas and the chief priests, Judas saying:
This is he who stole the law and the prophets. And the Jews gave Jesus an unjust trial, saying:
Why hast thou done these things? And he answered nothing.

<head>Chapter 3.</head>
<p>Having therefore done many and dreadful things against Jesus that night, they gave
Him up to Pilate the procurator at the dawn of the preparation, that he might crucify Him;
and for this purpose they all came together. After a trial, therefore, Pilate the procurator
ordered Him to be nailed to the cross, along with the two robbers. And they were nailed
up along with Jesus, Gestas on the left, and Demas on the right.</p>
<p>And he that was on the left began to cry out, saying to Jesus: See how many evil deeds
I have done in the earth; and if I had known that thou wast the king, I should have cut off
thee also. And why dost thou call thyself Son of God, and canst not help thyself in necessity?
how canst thou afford it to another one praying for help? If thou art the Christ, come down
from the cross, that I may believe in thee. But now I see thee perishing along with me, not
like a man, but like a wild beast. And many other things he began to say against Jesus,
blaspheming and gnashing his teeth upon Him. For the robber was taken alive in the snare
of the devil.2039</p>
<p>But the robber on the right hand, whose name was Demas, seeing the Godlike grace of
Jesus, thus cried out: I know Thee, Jesus Christ, that Thou art the Son of God. I see Thee,
Christ, adored by myriads of myriads of angels. Pardon me my sins which I have done. Do
not in my trial make the stars come against me, or the moon, when Thou shalt judge all the
world; because in the night I have accomplished my wicked purposes. Do not urge the sun,
which is now darkened on account of Thee, to tell the evils of my heart, for no gift can I
give Thee for the remission of my sins. Already death is coming upon me because of my
sins; but Thine is the propitiation. Deliver me, O Lord of all, from Thy fearful judgment.
Do not give the enemy power to swallow me up, and to become heir of my soul, as of that
of him who is hanging on the left; for I see how the devil joyfully takes his soul, and his body
disappears. Do not even order me to go away into the portion of the Jews; for I see Moses
and the patriarchs in great weeping, and the devil rejoicing over them. Before, then, O Lord,
my spirit departs, order my sins to be washed away, and remember me the sinner in Thy
kingdom, when upon the great most lofty throne2040 thou shalt judge the twelve tribes of
Israel.2041 For Thou hast prepared great punishment for Thy world on account of Thyself.</p>
<p>And the robber having thus spoken, Jesus says to him: Amen, amen; I say to thee, Demas,
that to-day thou shalt be with me in paradise.2042 And the sons of the kingdom, the children
of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, shall be cast out into outer darkness; there

shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.2043 And thou alone shalt dwell in paradise until
my second appearing, when I am to judge those who do not confess my name. And He said
to the robber: Go away, and tell the cherubim and the powers, that turn the flaming sword,
that guard paradise from the time that Adam, the first created, was in paradise, and sinned,
and kept not my commandments, and I cast him out thence. And none of the first shall see
paradise until I am to come the second time to judge living and dead. And He wrote thus:
Jesus Christ the Son of God, who have come down from the heights of the heavens, who
have come forth out of the bosom of the invisible Father without being separated from
Him,2044 and who have come down into the world to be made flesh, and to be nailed to a
cross, in order that I might save Adam, whom I fashioned,—to my archangelic powers, the
gatekeepers of paradise, to the officers of my Father: I will and order that he who has been
crucified along with me should go in, should receive remission of sins through me; and that
he, having put on an incorruptible body, should go in to paradise, and dwell where no one
has ever been able to dwell.</p>
<p>And, behold, after He had said this, Jesus gave up the ghost, on the day of the preparation,
at the ninth hour. And there was darkness over all the earth; and from a great earthquake
that happened, the sanctuary fell down, and the wing of the temple.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.</head>
<p>And I Joseph begged the body of Jesus, and put it in a new tomb, where no one had
been put. And of the robber on the right the body was not found; but of him on the left, as
the form of a dragon, so was his body.</p>
<p>And after I had begged the body of Jesus to bury, the Jews, carried away by hatred and
rage, shut me up in prison, where evil-doers were kept under restraint. And this happened
to me on the evening of the Sabbath, whereby our nation transgressed the law. And, behold,
that same nation of ours endured fearful tribulations on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>And now, on the evening of the first of the week, at the fifth hour of the night, Jesus
comes to me in the prison, along with the robber who had been crucified with Him on the
right, whom He sent into paradise. And there was a great light in the building. And the
house was hung up by the four corners, and the place was opened, and I came out. Then I
first recognised Jesus, and again the robber, bringing a letter to Jesus. And as we were going
into Galilee, there shone a great light, which the creation did not produce. And there was
also with the robber a great fragrance out of paradise.</p>
<p>And Jesus, having sat down in a certain place, thus read: We, the cherubim and the sixwinged,
who have been ordered by Thy Godhead to watch the garden of paradise, make the
following statement through the robber who was crucified along with Thee, by Thy arrangement:
When we saw the print of the nails of the robber crucified along with Thee, and the
shining light of the letter of Thy Godhead,2045 the fire indeed was extinguished, not being
able to bear the splendour of the print;2046 and we crouched down, being in great fear. For
we heard that the Maker of heaven and earth, and of the whole creation, had come down
from on high to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, on account of Adam, the first created.
And when we beheld the undefiled cross shining like lightning from the robber, gleaming
with sevenfold the light of the sun, trembling fell upon us. We felt a violent shaking of the
world below;2047 and with a loud voice, the ministers of Hades said, along with us: Holy,
holy, holy is He who in the beginning was in the highest. And the powers sent up a cry: O
Lord, Thou hast been made manifest in heaven and in earth, bringing joy to the world; and,
a greater gift than this, Thou hast freed Thine own image from death by the invisible purpose
of the ages.</p>

<p>After I had beheld these things, as I was going into Galilee with Jesus and the robber,
Jesus was transfigured, and was not as formerly, before He was crucified, but was altogether
light; and angels always ministered to Him, and Jesus spoke with them. And I remained
with Him three days. And no one of His disciples was with Him, except the robber alone.</p>
<p>And in the middle of the feast of unleavened bread, His disciple John comes, and we
no longer beheld the robber as to what took place. And John asked Jesus: Who is this, that
Thou hast not made me to be seen by him? But Jesus answered him nothing. And falling
down before Him, he said: Lord, I know that Thou hast loved me from the beginning, and
why dost Thou not reveal to me that man? Jesus says to him: Why dost thou seek what is
hidden? Art thou still without understanding? Dost thou not perceive the fragrance of
paradise filling the place? Dost thou not know who it is? The robber on the cross has become
heir of paradise. Amen, amen; I say to thee, that it shall belong to him alone until that the
great day shall come. And John said: Make me worthy to behold him.</p>
<p>And while John was yet speaking, the robber suddenly appeared; and John, struck with
astonishment, fell to the earth. And the robber was not in his first form, as before John
came; but he was like a king in great power, having on him the cross. And the voice of a
great multitude was sent forth: Thou hast come to the place prepared for thee in paradise.
We have been commanded by Him that has sent thee, to serve thee until the great day. And
after this voice, both the robber and I Joseph vanished, and I was found in my own house;
and I no longer saw Jesus.</p>
<p>And I, having seen these things, have written them down, in order that all may believe
in the crucified Jesus Christ our Lord, and may no longer obey the law of Moses, but may
believe in the signs and wonders that have happened through Him, and in order that we
who have believed may inherit eternal life, and be found in the kingdom of the heavens.
For to Him are due glory, strength, praise, and majesty for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>The Avenging of the Saviour.</head>
<p>This version of the legend of Veronica is written in very barbarous Latin, probably of
the seventh or eighth century. An Anglo-Saxon version, which Tischendorf concludes to
be derived from the Latin, was edited and translated for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society,
by C. W. Goodwin, in 1851. The Anglo-Saxon text is from a ms. in the Cambridge Library,
one of a number presented to the Cathedral of Exeter by Bishop Leofric in the beginning
of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>The reader will observe that there are in this document two distinct legends, somewhat
clumsily joined together—that of Nathan’s embassy, and that of Veronica.</p>
<p>Here Beginneth the Avenging of the Saviour.</p>
<p>In the days of the Emperor Tiberius Cæsar, when Herod was tetrarch, Christ was delivered
under Pontius Pilate by the Jews, and revealed by Tiberius.</p>
<p>In those days Titus2048 was a prince under Tiberius in the region of Equitania, in a city
of Libia which is called Burgidalla. And Titus had a sore in his right nostril, on account of
a cancer, and he had his face torn even to the eye. There went forth a certain man from
Judæa, by name Nathan the son of Nahum; for he was an Ishmaelite who went from land
to land, and from sea to sea, and in all the ends of the earth. Now Nathan was sent from
Judæa to the Emperor Tiberius, to carry their treaty to the city of Rome. And Tiberius was
ill, and full of ulcers and fevers, and had nine kinds of leprosy. And Nathan wished to go
to the city of Rome. But the north wind blew and hindered his sailing, and carried him
down to the harbour of a city of Libia. Now Titus, seeing the ship coming, knew that it was
from Judæa; and they all wondered, and said that they had never seen any vessel so coming
from that quarter. And Titus ordered the captain to come to him, and asked him who he
was. And he said: I am Nathan the son of Nahum, of the race of the Ishmaelites, and I am
a subject of Pontius Pilate in Judæa. And I have been sent to go to Tiberius the Roman
emperor, to carry a treaty from Judæa. And a strong wind came down upon the sea, and
has brought me to a country that I do not know.</p>
<p>And Titus says: If thou couldst at any time find anything either of cosmetics or herbs
which could cure the wound that I have in my face, as thou seest, so that I should become
whole, and regain my former health, I should bestow upon thee many good things. And
Nathan said to him: I do not know, nor have I ever known, of such things as thou speakest
<note type="footnote">2048 The Saxon version has Tirus.</note>

<pb n="1499"/>
to me about. But for all that, if thou hadst been some time ago in Jerusalem, there thou
wouldst have found a choice prophet, whose name was Emanuel, for He will save His people
from their sins. And He, as His first miracle in Cana of Galilee, made wine from water; and
by His word He cleansed lepers, He enlightened the eyes of one born blind, He healed
paralytics, He made demons flee, He raised up three dead; a woman caught in adultery, and
condemned by the Jews to be stoned, He set free; and another woman, named Veronica,
who suffered twelve years from an issue of blood, and came up to Him behind, and touched
the fringe of His garment, He healed; and with five loaves and two fishes He satisfied five
thousand men, to say nothing of little ones and women, and there remained of the fragments
twelve baskets. All these things, and many others, were accomplished before His passion.
After His resurrection we saw Him in the flesh as He had been before. And Titus said to
Him: How did he rise again from the dead, seeing that he was dead? And Nathan answered
and said: He was manifestly dead, and hung up on the cross, and again taken down from
the cross, and for three days He lay in the tomb: thereafter He rose again from the dead,
and went down to Hades, and freed the patriarchs and the prophets, and the whole human
race; thereafter He appeared to His disciples, and ate with them; thereafter they saw Him
going up into heaven. And so it is the truth, all this that I tell you. For I saw it with my own
eyes, and all the house of Israel. And Titus said in his own words: Woe to thee, O Emperor
Tiberius, full of ulcers, and enveloped in leprosy, because such a scandal has been committed
in thy kingdom; because thou hast made such laws2049 in Judæa, in the land of the birth of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and they have seized the King, and put to death the Ruler of the
peoples; and they have not made Him come to us to cure thee of thy leprosy, and cleanse
me from mine infirmity: on which account, if they had been before my face, with my own
hands I should have slain the carcases of those Jews, and hung them up on the cruel tree,
because they have destroyed my Lord, and mine eyes have not been worthy to see His face.
And when he had thus spoken, immediately the wound fell from the face of Titus, and his
flesh and his face were restored to health. And all the sick who were in the same place were
made whole in that hour. And Titus cried out, and all the rest with him, in a loud voice,
saying: My King and my God, because I have never seen Thee, and Thou hast made me
whole, bid me go with the ship over the waters to the land of Thy birth, to take vengeance
on Thine enemies; and help me, O Lord, that I may be able to destroy them, and avenge
Thy death: do Thou, Lord, deliver them into my hand. And having thus spoken, he ordered
that he should be baptized. And he called Nathan to him, and said to him: How hast thou
seen those baptized who believe in Christ? Come to me, and baptize me in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.2050 For I also firmly believe in the
<note type="footnote">2049 Reges, kings, instead of leges, as suggested by Mr. Cowper, is a much better reading.</note>
<note type="footnote">2050 Sax.: Then Nathan came, and baptized him in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
and took away from him his name of Tirus, and called him in his baptism Titus, which is in our language Pius.</note>

<pb n="1500"/>
Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart, and with all my soul; because nowhere in the whole
world is there another who has created me, and made me whole from my wounds.
And having thus spoken, he sent messengers to Vespasian to come with all haste with
his bravest men, so prepared as if for war.</p>
<p>Then Vespasian brought with him five thousand armed men, and they went to meet
Titus. And when they had come to the city of Libia, he said to Titus: Why is it that thou
hast made me come hither? And he said: Know that Jesus has come into this world, and
has been born in Judæa, in a place which is called Bethlehem, and has been given up by the
Jews, and scourged, and crucified on Mount Calvary,2051 and has risen again from the dead
on the third day. And His disciples have seen Him in the same flesh in which he was born,
and He has shown Himself to His disciples, and they have believed in Him. And we indeed
wish to become His disciples. Now, let us go and destroy His enemies from the earth, that
they may now know that there is none like the Lord our God on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>With this design, then, they went forth from the city of Libia which is called Burgidalla,
2052 and went on board a ship, and proceeded to Jerusalem, and surrounded the kingdom
of the Jews, and began to send them to destruction. And when the kings of the Jews heard
of their doings, and the wasting of their land, fear came upon them, and they were in great
perplexity. Then Archelaus2053 was perplexed in his words, and said to his son: My son,
take my kingdom and judge it; and take counsel with the other kings who are in the land of
Judah, that you may be able to escape from our enemies. And having thus said, he unsheathed
his sword and leant upon it; and turned his sword, which was very sharp, and thrust it into
his breast, and died. And his son allied himself with the other kings who were under him,
and they took counsel among themselves, and went into Jerusalem with their chief men
who were in their counsel, and stood in the same place seven years. And Titus and Vespasian
took counsel to surround their city. And they did so. And the seven years being fulfilled,
there was a very sore famine, and for want of bread they began to eat earth. Then all the
soldiers who were of the four kings took counsel among themselves, and said: Now we are
sure to die: what will God do to us? or of what good is our life to us, because the Romans
have come to take our place and nation? It is better for us to kill each other, than that the
Romans should say that they have slain us, and gained the victory over us. And they drew
their swords and smote themselves, and died, to the number of twelve thousand men of
them. Then there was a great stench in that city from the corpses of those dead men. And
their kings feared with a very great fear even unto death; and they could not bear the stench

of them, nor bury them, nor throw them forth out of the city. And they said to each other:
What shall we do? We indeed gave up Christ to death, and now we given up to death
ourselves. Let us bow our heads, and give up the keys of the city to the Romans, because
God has already given us up to death. And immediately they went up upon the walls of the
city, and all cried out with a loud voice, saying: Titus and Vespasian, take the keys of the
city, which have been given to you by Messiah, who is called Christ.
Then they gave themselves up into the hands of Titus and Vespasian, and said: Judge
us, seeing that we ought to die, because we judged Christ; and he was given up without
cause. Titus and Vespasian seized them, and some they stoned, and some they hanged on
a tree, feet up and head down, and struck them through with lances; and others they gave
up to be sold, and others they divided among themselves, and made four parts of them, just
as they had done of the garments of the Lord. And they said: They sold Christ for thirty
pieces of silver, and we shall sell thirty of them for one denarius. And so they did. And
having done so, they seized all the lands of Judæa and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Then they made a search about the face or portrait2054 of Jesus, how they might find
it.2055 And they found a woman named Veronica who had it. Then they seized Pilate, and
sent him to prison, to be guarded by four quaternions of soldiers at the door of the prison.
Then they forthwith sent their messengers to Tiberius, the emperor of the city of Rome,
that he should send Velosianus to them. And he said to him: Take all that is necessary for
thee in the sea, and go down into Judæa, and seek out one of the disciples of him who is
called Christ and Lord, that he may come to me, and in the name of his God cure me of the
leprosy and the infirmities by which I am daily exceedingly burdened, and of my wounds,
because I am ill at ease. And send upon the kings of the Jews, who are subject to my authority,
thy forces and terrible engines, because they have put to death Jesus Christ our Lord, and
condemn them to death. And if thou shalt there find a man as may be able to free me from
this infirmity of mine, I will believe in Christ the Son of God, and will baptize myself in his
name. And Velosianus said: My lord emperor, if I find such a man as may be able to help
and free us, what reward shall I promise him? Tiberius said to him: The half of my kingdom,
without fail, to be in his hand.</p>
<p>Then Velosianus immediately went forth, and went on board the ship, and hoisted the
sail in the vessel, and went on sailing through the sea. And he sailed a year and seven days,
after which he arrived at Jerusalem. And immediately he ordered some of the Jews to come
to his power, and began carefully to ask what had been the acts of Christ. Then Joseph, of

the city of Arimathæa, and Nicodemus, came at the same time. And Nicodemus said: I
saw Him, and I know indeed that He is the Saviour of the world. And Joseph said to him:
And I took Him down from the cross, and laid Him in a new tomb, which had been cut out
of the rock. And the Jews kept me shut up on the day of the preparation, at evening; and
while I was standing in prayer on the Sabbath-day, the house was hung up by the four
corners, and I saw the Lord Jesus Christ like a gleam of light, and for fear I fell to the ground.
And He said to me, Look upon me, for I am Jesus, whose body thou buriedst in thy tomb.
And I said to Him, Show me the sepulchre where I laid Thee. And Jesus, holding my hand
in His right hand, led me to the place where I buried Him.2056</p>
<p>And there came also the woman named Veronica, and said to him: And I touched in
the crowd the fringe of His garment, because for twelve years I had suffered from an issue
of blood; and He immediately healed me. Then Velosianus said to Pilate: Thou, Pilate,
impious and cruel, why hast thou slain the Son of God? And Pilate answered: His own
nation, and the chief priests Annas and Caiaphas, gave him to me. Velosianus said: Impious
and cruel, thou art worthy of death and cruel punishment. And he sent him back to prison.
And Velosianus at last sought for the face or the countenance of the Lord. And all who
were in that same place said: It is the woman called Veronica who has the portrait of the
Lord in her house. And immediately he ordered her to be brought before his power. And
he said to her: Hast thou the portrait of the Lord in thy house? But she said, No. Then
Velosianus ordered her to be put to the torture, until she should give up the portrait of the
Lord. And she was forced to say: I have it in clean linen, my lord, and I daily adore it. Velosianus
said: Show it to me. Then she showed the portrait of the Lord. When Velosianus
saw it, he prostrated himself on the ground; and with a ready heart and true faith he took
hold of it, and wrapped it in cloth of gold, and placed it in a casket, and sealed it with his
ring. And he swore with an oath, and said: As the Lord God liveth, and by the health of
Cæsar, no man shall any more see it upon the face of the earth, until I see the face of my
lord Tiberius. And when he had thus spoken, the princes, who were the chief men of Judæa,
seized Pilate to take him to a seaport. And he took the portrait of the Lord, with all His
disciples, and all in his pay, and they went on board the ship the same day. Then the woman
Veronica, for the love of Christ, left all that she possessed, and followed Velosianus. And
Velosianus said to her: What dost thou wish, woman, or what dost thou seek? And she
answered: I am seeking the portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ, who enlightened me, not for

tomb which I had cut out of the rock. And I was one of those who guarded His tomb: and I bent my head and
thought I should see Him, but I beheld nothing of Him, but saw two angels, one at the head and the other at the
foot, and they asked me whom I was seeking. I answered and said to them, I seek Jesus who was crucified.
Again they said to me, Go into Galilee; there shall you see Him, as He said to you before.

my own merits, but through His own holy affection.2057 Give back to me the portrait of
my Lord Jesus Christ; for because of this I die with a righteous longing. But if thou do not
give it back to me, I will not leave it until I see where thou wilt put it, because I, most
miserable woman that I am, will serve Him all the days of my life; because I believe that He,
my Redeemer, liveth for everlasting.</p>
<p>Then Velosianus ordered the woman Veronica to be taken down with him into the
ship. And the sails being hoisted, they began to go in the vessel in the name of the Lord,
and they sailed through the sea. But Titus, along with Vespasian, went up into Judæa,
avenging all nations upon their land.2058 At the end of a year Velosianus came to the city
of Rome, brought his vessel into the river which is called Tiberis, or Tiber, and entered the
city which is called Rome. And he sent his messenger to his lord Tiberius the emperor in
the Lateran about his prosperous arrival.</p>
<p>Then Tiberius the emperor, when he heard the message of Velosianus, rejoiced greatly,
and ordered him to come before his face. And when he had come, he called him, saying:
Velosianus, how hast thou come, and what hast thou seen in the region of Judæa of Christ
the Lord and his disciples? Tell me, I beseech thee, that he is going to cure me of mine infirmity,
that I may be at once cleansed from that leprosy which I have over my body, and I
give up my whole kingdom into thy power and his.</p>
<p>And Velosianus said: My lord emperor, I found thy servants Titus and Vespasian in
Judæa fearing the Lord, and they were cleansed from all their ulcers and sufferings. And I
found that all the kings and rulers of Judæa have been hanged by Titus; Annas and Caiaphas
have been stoned, Archelaus has killed himself with his own lance; and I have sent Pilate to
Damascus in bonds, and kept him in prison under safe keeping. But I have also found out
about Jesus, whom the Jews most wickedly attacked with swords, and staves, and weapons;
and they crucified him who ought to have freed and enlightened us, and to have come to
us, and they hanged him on a tree. And Joseph came from Arimathæa, and Nicodemus
with him, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds, to anoint the
body of Jesus; and they took him down from the cross, and laid him in a new tomb. And
on the third day he most assuredly rose again from the dead, and showed himself to his
disciples in the same flesh in which he had been born. At length, after forty days, they saw
him going up into heaven. Many, indeed, and other miracles did Jesus before his passion

and after. First, of water he made wine; he raised the dead, he cleansed lepers, he enlightened
the blind, he cured paralytics, he put demons to flight; he made the deaf hear, the dumb
speak; Lazarus, when four days dead, he raised from the tomb; the woman Veronica, who
suffered from an issue of blood twelve years, and touched the fringe of his garment, he made
whole. Then it pleased the Lord in the heavens, that the Son of God, who, sent into this
world as the first-created, had died upon earth, should send his angel; and he commanded
Titus and Vespasian, whom I knew in that place where thy throne is. And it pleased God
Almighty that they went into Judæa and Jerusalem, and seized thy subjects, and put them
under that sentence, as it were, in the same manner as they did when thy subjects seized
Jesus and bound him. And Vespasian afterwards said: What shall we do about those who
shall remain? Titus answered: They hanged our Lord on a green tree, and struck him with
a lance; now let us hang them on a dry tree, and pierce their bodies through and through
with the lance. And they did so. And Vespasian said: What about those who are left? Titus
answered: They seized the tunic of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of it made four parts; now
let us seize them, and divide them into four parts,—to thee one, to me one, to thy men another,
and to my servants the fourth part. And they did so. And Vespasian said: But what
shall we do about those who are left? Titus answered him: The Jews sold our Lord for thirty
pieces of silver: now let us sell thirty of them for one piece of silver. And they did so. And
they seized Pilate, and gave him up to me, and I put him in prison, to be guarded by four
quaternions of soldiers in Damascus. Then they made a search with great diligence to seek
the portrait of the Lord; and they found a woman named Veronica who had the portrait of
the Lord. Then the Emperor Tiberius said to Velosianus: How hast thou it? And he
answered: I have it in clean cloth of gold, rolled up in a shawl. And the Emperor Tiberius
said: Bring it to me, and spread it before my face, that I, falling to the ground and bending
my knees, may adore it on the ground. Then Velosianus spread out his shawl with the cloth
of gold on which the portrait of the Lord had been imprinted; and the Emperor Tiberius
saw it. And he immediately adored the image of the Lord with a pure heart, and his flesh
was cleansed as the flesh of a little child. And all the blind, the lepers, the lame, the dumb,
the deaf, and those possessed by various diseases, who were there present, were healed, and
cured, and cleansed. And the Emperor Tiberius bowed his head and bent his knees, considering
that saying: Blessed is the womb which bore Thee, and the breasts which Thou hast
sucked; and he groaned to the Lord, saying with tears: God of heaven and earth, do not
permit me to sin, but confirm my soul and my body, and place me in Thy kingdom, because
in Thy name do I trust always: free me from all evils, as Thou didst free the three children
from the furnace of blazing fire.</p>
<p>Then said the Emperor Tiberius to Velosianus: Velosianus, hast thou seen any of those
men who saw Christ? Velosianus answered: I have. He said: Didst thou ask how they
baptize those who believed in Christ? Velosianus said: Here, my Lord, we have one of the

<pb n="1505"/>
disciples of Christ himself. Then he ordered Nathan to be summoned to come to him.
Nathan therefore came and baptized him in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. Amen. Immediately the Emperor Tiberius, made whole from all his diseases,
ascended upon his throne, and said: Blessed art Thou, O Lord God Almighty, and worthy
to be praised, who hast freed me from the snare of death, and cleansed me from all mine
iniquities; because I have greatly sinned before Thee, O Lord my God, and I am not worthy
to see Thy face. And then the Emperor Tiberius was instructed in all the articles of the faith,
fully, and with strong faith.</p>
<p>May that same God Almighty, who is King of kings and Lord of lords, Himself shield
us in His faith, and defend us, and deliver us from all danger and evil, and deign to bring
us to life everlasting, when this life, which is temporary, shall fail; who is blessed for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul.</head>
<p>It came to pass, after Paul went out of the island Gaudomeleta,2059 that he came to Italy;
and it was heard of by the Jews who were in Rome, the elder of the cities, that Paul demanded
to come to Cæsar. Having fallen, therefore, into great grief and much despondency, they
said among themselves: It does not please him that he alone has afflicted all our brethren
and parents in Judæa and Samaria, and in all Palestine; and he has not been pleased with
these, but, behold, he comes here also, having through imposition asked Cæsar to destroy
us.</p>
<p>Having therefore made an assembly against Paul, and having considered many proposals,
2060 it seemed good to them to go to Nero the emperor, to ask him not to allow Paul to
come to Rome. Having therefore got in readiness not a few presents, and having carried
them with them, with supplication they came before him, saying: We beseech thee, O good
emperor, send orders into all the governments of your worship, to the effect that Paul is not
to come near these parts; because this Paul, having afflicted all the nation of our fathers, has
been seeking to come hither to destroy us also. And the affliction, O most worshipful emperor,
which we have from Peter is enough for us.</p>
<p>And the Emperor Nero, having heard these things, answered them: It is2061 according
to your wish. And we write to all our governments that he shall not on any account come
to anchor in the parts of Italy. And they also informed Simon the magian, having sent for
him, that, as has been said, he should not come into the parts of Italy.</p>
<p>And while they were thus doing, some of those that had repented out of the nations,
and that had been baptized at the preaching of Peter, sent elders to Paul with a letter to the
following effect: Paul, dear servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, and brother of Peter, the first
of the apostles, we have heard from the rabbis of the Jews that are in this Rome, the greatest
of the cities, that they have asked Cæsar to send into all his governments, in order that,
wherever thou mayst be found, thou mayst be put to death. But we have believed, and do
believe, that as God does not separate the two great lights which He has made, so He is not
to part you from each other, that is, neither Peter from Paul, nor Paul from Peter; but we

become worthy also of your teaching.</p>
<p>And Paul, having received the two men sent with the letter on the twentieth of the month
of May, became eager to go, and gave thanks to the Lord and Master Jesus Christ. And
having sailed from Gaudomeleta, he did not now come through Africa to the parts of Italy,
but ran to Sicily, until he came to the city of Syracuse with the two men who had been sent
from Rome to him. And having sailed thence, he came to Rhegium of Calabria, and from
Rhegium he crossed to Mesina, and there ordained a bishop, Bacchylus by name. And when
he came out of Mesina he sailed to Didymus, and remained there one night. And having
sailed thence, he came to Pontiole2062 on the second day.</p>
<p>And Dioscorus the shipmaster, who brought him to Syracuse, sympathizing with Paul
because he had delivered his son from death, having left his own ship in Syracuse, accompanied
him to Pontiole. And some of Peter’s disciples having been found there, and having
received Paul, exhorted him to stay with them. And he stayed a week, in hiding, because
of the command of Cæsar. And all the toparchs were watching to seize and kill him. But
Dioscorus the shipmaster, being himself also bald, wearing his shipmaster’s dress, and
speaking boldly, on the first day went out into the city of Pontiole. Thinking therefore that
he was Paul, they seized him, and beheaded him, and sent his head to Cæsar.
Cæsar therefore, having summoned the first men of the Jews, announced to them, saying:
Rejoice with great joy, for Paul your enemy is dead. And he showed them the head. Hav
ing therefore made great rejoicing on that day, which was the fourteenth of the month of
June, each of the Jews fully believed it.</p>
<p>And Paul, being in Pontiole, and having heard that Dioscorus had been beheaded, being
grieved with great grief, gazing into the height of the heaven, said: O Lord Almighty in
heaven, who hast appeared to me in every place whither I have gone on account of Thine
only-begotten Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, punish this city, and bring out all who have
believed in God and followed His word. He said to them therefore: Follow me: And going
forth from Pontiole with those who had believed in the word of God, they came to a place
called Baias;2063 and looking up with their eyes, they all see that city called Pontiole sunk
into the sea-shore about one fathom; and there it is until this day, for a remembrance, under
the sea.</p>
<p>And having gone forth from Baias, they went to Gaitas, and there he taught the word
of God. And he stayed there three days in the house of Erasmus, whom Peter sent from
Rome to teach the Gospel of God. And having come forth from Gaitas, he came to the castle

called Taracinas, and stayed there seven days in the house of Cæsarius the deacon, whom
Peter had ordained by the laying on of hands. And sailing thence, he came by the river to
a place called Tribus Tabernes.</p>
<p>And those who had been saved out of the city of Pontiole that had been swallowed up,
reported to Cæsar in Rome that Pontiole had been swallowed up, with all its multitude.
And the emperor, being in great grief on account of the city, having summoned the chief
of the Jews, said to them: Behold, on account of what I heard from you, I have caused Paul
to be beheaded, and on account of this the city has been swallowed up. And the chief of the
Jews said to Cæsar: Most worshipful emperor, did we not say to thee that he troubled all
the country of the East, and perverted our fathers? It is better therefore, most worshipful
emperor, that one city be destroyed, and not the seat of thine empire; for this had Rome to
suffer. And the emperor, having heard their words, was appeased.</p>
<p>And Paul stayed in Tribus Tabernes four days. And departing thence, he came to Appii
Forum, which is called Vicusarape; and having slept there that night, he saw one sitting on
a golden chair, and a multitude of blacks standing beside him, saying: I have to-day made
a son murder his father. Another said: And I have made a house fall, and kill parents with
children. And they reported to him many evil deeds—some of one kind, some of another.
And another coming, reported to him: I have managed that the bishop Juvenalius, whom
Peter ordained, should sleep with the abbess Juliana. And having heard all these things
when sleeping in that Appii Forum, near Vicusarape, straightway and immediately he sent
to Rome one of those who had followed him from Pontiole to the bishop Juvenalius, telling
him this same thing which had just been done. And on the following day, Juvenalius, running,
threw himself at the feet of Peter, weeping and lamenting, and saying what had just
befallen; and he recounted to him the matter, and said: I believe that this is the light which
thou wast awaiting. And Peter said to him: How is it possible that it is he when he is dead?
And Juvenalius the bishop took to Peter him that had been sent by Paul, and he reported
to him that he was alive, and on his way, and that he was at Appii Forum. And Peter thanked
and glorified the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Then having summoned his disciples that believed, he sent them to Paul as far as Tribus
Tabernes. And the distance from Rome to Tribus Tabernes is thirty-eight miles.2064 And
Paul seeing them, having given thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, took courage; and departing
thence, they slept in the city called Aricia.</p>
<p>And a report went about in the city of Rome that Paul the brother of Peter was coming.
And those that believed in God rejoiced with great joy. And there was great consternation
among the Jews; and having gone to Simon the magian, they entreated him, saying: Report

to the emperor that Paul is not dead, but that he is alive, and has come. And Simon said to
the Jews: What head is it, then, which came to Cæsar from Pontiole? Was it not bald also?</p>
<p>And Paul having come to Rome, great fear fell upon the Jews. They came together
therefore to him, and exhorted him, saying: Vindicate the faith in which thou wast born;
for it is not right that thou, being a Hebrew, and of the Hebrews, shouldst call thyself
teacher of Gentiles, and vindicator of the uncircumcised; and, being thyself circumcised,
that thou shouldst bring to nought the faith of the circumcision.2065 And when thou seest
Peter, contend against his teaching, because he has destroyed all the bulwarks of our law;
for he has prevented the keeping of Sabbaths and new moons, and the holidays appointed
by the law. And Paul, answering, said to them: That I am a true Jew, by this you can prove;
because also you have been able to keep the Sabbath, and to observe the true circumcision;
for assuredly on the day of the Sabbath God rested from all His works. We have fathers,
and patriarchs, and the law. What, then, does Peter preach in the kingdom of the Gentiles?
But if he shall wish to bring in any new teaching, without any tumult, and envy, and trouble,
send him word, that we may see, and in your presence I shall convict him. But if his teaching
be true, supported by the book and testimony of the Hebrews, it becomes all of us to submit
to him.</p>
<p>Paul saying these and such like things, the Jews went and said to Peter: Paul of the
Hebrews has come, and entreats thee to come to him, since those who have brought him
say that he cannot meet whomsoever he may wish until he appear before Cæsar. And Peter
having heard, rejoiced with great joy; and rising up, immediately went to him. And seeing
each other, they wept for joy; and long embracing each other, they bedewed each other with
tears.</p>
<p>And when Paul had related to Peter the substance2066 of all his doings, and how, through
the disasters of the ship, he had come, Peter also told him what he had suffered from Simon
the magian, and all his plots. And having told these things, he went away towards evening.
And in the morning of the following day, at dawn, behold, Peter coming, finds a multitude
of the Jews before Paul’s door. And there was a great uproar between the Christian
Jews and the Gentiles. For, on the one hand, the Jews said: We are a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, the friends of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, with whom
God spake, to whom He showed His own mysteries and His great wonders. But you of the
Gentiles are no great thing in your lineage; if otherwise, you have become polluted and abominable
by idols and graven images.</p>
<p>While the Jews were saying such things, and such-like, those of the Gentiles answered,
saying: We, when we heard the truth, straightway followed it, having abandoned our errors.</p>
<note type="footnote">2065 Or, do away with belief in circumcision.</note>

<p>But you, both knowing the mighty deeds of your fathers, and seeing the signs of the
prophets, and having received the law, and gone through the sea with dry feet, and seen
your enemies sunk in its depths, and the pillar of fire by night and of cloud by day shining
upon you, and manna having been given to you out of heaven, and water flowing to you
out of a rock,—after all these things you fashioned to yourselves the idol of a calf, and worshipped
the graven image. But we, having seen none of the signs, believe to be a Saviour
the God whom you have forsaken in unbelief.</p>
<p>While they were contending in these and such-like words, the Apostle Paul said that
they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed
to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to Abraham our father, that in
his seed he should inherit all the nations.2067 For there is no respect of persons with God.2068
As many as have sinned in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have sinned
without law shall perish without law.2069 But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according
to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a holy people to Himself: so that in this we ought
to boast, whether Jews or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.</p>
<p>And Paul having thus spoken, both the Jews and they of the Gentiles were appeased.
But the rulers of the Jews assailed Peter. And Peter, when they accused him of having renounced
their synagogues, said: Hear, brethren, the holy Spirit about the patriarch David,
promising, Of the fruit of thy womb shall He set upon thy throne.2070 Him therefore to
whom the Father said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee, the chief priests
through envy crucified; but that He might accomplish the salvation of the world, it was allowed
that He should suffer all these things.2071 Just as, therefore, from the side of Adam
Eve was created, so also from the side of Christ was created the Church, which has no spot
nor blemish. In Him,2072 therefore, God has opened an entrance to all the sons of Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in order that they may be in the faith of profession towards Him,2073
and have life and salvation in His name. Turn, therefore, and enter into the joy of your
father Abraham, because God hath fulfilled what He promised to him. Whence also the
prophet says, The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever, after the
order of Melchizedec.2074 For a priest He became upon the cross, when He offered the
whole burnt-offering of His own body and blood as a sacrifice for all the world.

And Peter saying this and such-like, the most part of the people believed. And it
happened also that Nero’s wife Libia, and the yoke-fellow of Agrippa the prefect, Agrippina
by name, thus believed, so that also they went away from beside their own husbands. And
on account of the teaching of Paul, many, despising military life, clung to God; so that even
from the emperor’s bed-chamber some came to him, and having become Christians, were
no longer willing to return to the army or the palace.</p>
<p>When, consequently, the people were making a seditious murmuring, Simon, moved
with zeal, rouses himself, and began to say many evil things about Peter, saying that he was
a wizard and a cheat. And they believed him, wondering at his miracles; for he made a
brazen serpent move itself, and stone statues to laugh and move themselves, and himself to
run and suddenly to be raised into the air. But as a set-off to these, Peter healed the sick by
a word, by praying made the blind to see, put demons to flight by a command; sometimes
he even raised the dead. And he said to the people that they should not only flee from Simon’s
deceit, but also that they should expose him, that they might not seem to be slaves to the
devil.</p>
<p>And thus it happened that all pious men abhorred Simon the magian, and proclaimed
him impious. But those who adhered to Simon strongly affirmed Peter to be a magian,
bearing false witness as many of them as were with Simon the magian; so that the matter
came even to the ears of Nero the Cæsar, and he gave order to bring Simon the magian before
him. And he, coming in, stood before him, and began suddenly to assume different forms,
so that on a sudden he became a child, and after a little an old man, and at other times a
young man; for he changed himself both in face and stature into different forms, and was
in a frenzy, having the devil as his servant. And Nero beholding this, supposed him to be
truly the son of God; but the Apostle Peter showed him to be both a liar and a wizard, base
and impious and apostate, and in all things opposed to the truth of God, and that nothing
yet remained except that his wickedness, being made apparent by the command of God,
might be made manifest to them all.</p>
<p>Then Simon, having gone in to Nero, said: Hear, O good emperor: I am the son of God
come down from heaven. Until now I have endured Peter only calling himself an apostle;
but now he has doubled the evil: for Paul also himself teaches the same things, and having
his mind turned against me, is said to preach along with him; in reference to whom, if thou
shalt not contrive their destruction, it is very plain that thy kingdom cannot stand.</p>
<p>Then Nero, filled with concern, ordered to bring them speedily before him. And on
the following day Simon the magian, and Peter and Paul the apostles of Christ, having come
in to Nero, Simon said: These are the disciples of the Nazarene, and it is not at all well that
they should be of the people of the Jews, Nero said: What is a Nazarene? Simon said: There
is a city of Judah which has always been opposed to us, called Nazareth, and to it the teacher
of these men belonged. Nero said: God commands us to love every man; why, then, dost

<pb n="1512"/>
thou persecute them? Simon said: This is a race of men who have turned aside all Judæa
from believing in me. Nero said to Peter: Why are you thus unbelieving, according to your
race?2075 Then Peter said to Simon: Thou hast been able to impose upon all, but upon me
never; and those who have been deceived, God has through me recalled from their error.
And since thou hast learned by experience that thou canst not get the better of me, I wonder
with what face thou boastest thyself before the emperor, and supposest that through thy
magic art thou shalt overcome the disciples of Christ. Nero said: Who is Christ? Peter
said: He is what this Simon the magian affirms himself to be; but this is a most wicked man,
and his works are of the devil. But if thou wishest to know, O good emperor, the things that
have been done in Judæa about Christ, take the writings of Pontius Pilate sent to Claudius,
and thus thou wilt know all. And Nero ordered them to be brought, and to be read in their
presence; and they were to the following effect:2076—</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate to Claudius, greeting. There has lately happened an event which I myself
was concerned in. For the Jews through envy have inflicted on themselves, and those
coming after them, dreadful judgments. Their fathers had promises that their God would
send them his holy one from heaven, who according to reason should be called their king,
and he had promised to send him to the earth by means of a virgin. He, then, when I was
procurator, came into Judæa. And they saw2077 him enlightening the blind, cleansing lepers,
healing paralytics, expelling demons from men, raising the dead, subduing the winds,
walking upon the waves of the sea, and doing many other wonders, and all the people of
the Jews calling him Son of God. Then the chief priests, moved with envy against him,
seized him, and delivered him to me; and telling one lie after another, they said that he was
a wizard, and did contrary to their law. And I, having believed that these things were so,
gave him up, after scourging him, to their will;2078 and they crucified him, and after he was
buried set guards over him. But he, while my soldiers were guarding him, rose on the third
day. And to such a degree was the wickedness of the Jews inflamed against him, that they
gave money to the soldiers, saying, Say his disciples have stolen his body. But they, having
taken the money, were not able to keep silence as to what had happened; for they have

testified that they have seen him (after he was) risen, and that they have received money
from the Jews. These things, therefore, have I reported, that no one should falsely speak
otherwise, and that thou shouldest not suppose that the falsehoods of the Jews are to be
believed.</p>
<p>And the letter having been read, Nero said: Tell me, Peter, were all these things thus
done by him? Peter said: They were, with your permission, O good emperor. For this Simon
is full of lies and deceit, even if it should seem that he is what he is not—a god. And in Christ
there is all excellent victory through God and through man,2079 which that incomprehensible
glory assumed which through man deigned to come to the assistance of men. But in this
Simon there are two essences, of man and of devil, who through man endeavours to ensnare
men.</p>
<p>Simon said: I wonder, O good emperor, that you reckon this man of any consequence—a
man uneducated, a fisherman of the poorest, and endowed with power neither in word nor
by rank. But, that I may not long endure him as an enemy, I shall forthwith order my angels
to come and avenge me upon him. Peter said: I am not afraid of thy angels; but they shall
be much more afraid of me in the power and trust of my Lord Jesus Christ, whom thou
falsely declarest thyself to be.</p>
<p>Nero said: Art thou not afraid, Peter, of Simon, who confirms his godhead by deeds?
Peter said: Godhead is in Him who searcheth the hidden things of the heart.2080 Now then,
tell me what I am thinking about, or what I am doing. I disclose to thy servants who are
here what my thought is, before he tells lies about it, in order that he may not dare to lie as
to what I am thinking about. Nero said: Come hither, and tell me what thou art thinking
about. Peter said: Order a barley loaf to be brought, and to be given to me secretly. And
when he ordered it to be brought, and secretly given to Peter, Peter said: Now tell us, Simon,
what has been thought about, or what said, or what done.</p>
<p>Nero said: Do you mean me to believe that Simon does not know these things, who
both raised a dead man, and presented himself on the third day after he had been beheaded,
and who has done whatever he said he would do? Peter said: But he did not do it before
me. Nero said: But he did all these before me. For assuredly he ordered angels to come to
him, and they came. Peter said: If he has done what is very great, why does he not do what
is very small? Let him tell what I had in my mind, and what I have done. Nero said: Between
you, I do not know myself. Simon said: Let Peter say what I am thinking of, or what I am
doing. Peter said: What Simon has in his mind I shall show that I know, by my doing what
he is thinking about. Simon said: Know this, O emperor, that no one knows the thoughts
of men, but God alone. Is not, therefore, Peter lying? Peter said: Do thou, then, who sayest
<note type="footnote">2079 i.e., human nature.</note>
<note type="footnote">2080 Jer. xvii. 10; Rev. ii. 23.</note>

<pb n="1514"/>
that thou art the Son of God, tell what I have in my mind; disclose, if thou canst, what I have
just done in secret. For Peter, having blessed the barley loaf which he had received, and
hawing broken it with his right hand and his left, had heaped it up in his sleeves. Then Simon,
enraged that he was not able to tell the secret of the apostle, cried out, saying: Let great dogs
come forth, and eat him up before Cæsar. And suddenly there appeared great dogs, and
rushed at Peter. But Peter, stretching forth his hands2081 to pray, showed to the dogs the
loaf which he had blessed; which the dogs seeing, no longer appeared. Then Peter said to
Nero: Behold, I have shown thee that I knew what Simon was thinking of, not by words,
but by deeds; for he, having promised that he would bring angels against me, has brought
dogs, in order that he might show that he had not god-like but dog-like angels.</p>
<p>Then Nero said to Simon: What is it, Simon? I think we have got the worst of it. Simon
said: This man, both in Judæa and in all Palestine and Cæsarea, has done the same to me;2082
and from very often striving with me, he has learned that this is adverse to them. This, then,
he has learned how to escape from me; for the thoughts of men no one knows but God
alone. And Peter said to Simon: Certainly thou feignest thyself to be a god; why, then, dost
thou not reveal the thoughts of every man?</p>
<p>Then Nero, turning to Paul, said: Why dost thou say nothing, Paul? Paul answered
and said: Know this, O emperor, that if thou permittest this magician to do such things, it
will bring an access of the greatest mischief to thy country, and will bring down thine empire
from its position. Nero said to Simon: What sayest thou? Simon said: If I do not manifestly
hold myself out to be a god, no one will bestow upon me due reverence. Nero said: And
now, why dost thou delay, and not show thyself to be a god, in order that these men may
be punished? Simon said: Give orders to build for me a lofty tower of wood, and I, going
up upon it, will call my angels, and order them to take me, in the sight of all, to my father
in heaven; and these men, not being able to do this, are put to shame as2083 uneducated
men. And Nero said to Peter: Hast thou heard, Peter, what has been said by Simon? From
this will appear how much power either he or thy god has. Peter said: O most mighty emperor,
if thou wert willing, thou mightst perceive that he is full of demons. Nero said: Why
do you make to me roundabouts of circumlocutions? To-morrow will prove you.</p>
<p>Simon said: Dost thou believe, O good emperor, that I who was dead, and rose again,
am a magician? For it had been brought about by his own cleverness that the unbelieving
Simon had said to Nero: Order me to be beheaded in a dark place, and there to be left slain;
and if I do not rise on the third day, know that I am a magician; but if I rise again, know
that I am the Son of God.</p>

<pb n="1515"/>
<p>And Nero having ordered this, in the dark, by his magic art he managed that a ram
should be beheaded. And for so long did the ram appear to be Simon until he was beheaded.
And when he had been beheaded in the dark, he that had beheaded him, taking the head,
found it to be that of a ram; but he would not say anything to the emperor, lest he should
scourge him, having ordered this to be done in secret. Thereafter, accordingly. Simon said
that he had risen on the third day, because he took away the head of the ram and the
limbs—but the blood had been there congealed—and on the third day he showed himself
to Nero, and said: Cause to be wiped away my blood that has been poured out; for, behold,
having been beheaded, as I promised, I have risen again on the third day.</p>
<p>And when Nero said, To-morrow will prove you, turning to Paul, he says: Thou Paul,
why dost thou say nothing? Either who taught thee, or whom thou hast for a master, or
how thou hast taught in the cities, or what things have happened through thy teaching?
For I think that thou hast not any wisdom, and art not able to accomplish any work of
power. Paul answered: Dost thou suppose that I ought to speak against a desperate man,
a magician, who has given his soul up to death, whose destruction and perdition will come
speedily? For he ought to speak who pretends to be what he is not, and deceives men by
magic art. If thou consentest to hear his words, and to shield him, thou shalt destroy thy
soul and thy kingdom, for he is a most base man. And as the Egyptians Jannes and Jambres
led Pharaoh and his army astray until they were swallowed up in the sea, so also he, through
the instruction of his father the devil, persuades men to do many evils to themselves, and
thus deceives many of the innocent, to the peril of thy kingdom. But as for the word of the
devil, which I see has been poured out through this man, with groanings of my heart I am
dealing with the Holy Spirit, that it may be clearly shown what it is; for as far as he seems
to raise himself towards heaven, so far will he be sunk down into the depth of Hades, where
there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. But about the teaching of my Master, of which thou
didst ask me, none attain it except the pure, who allow faith to come into their heart.2084
For as many things as belong to peace and love, these have I taught. Round about from
Jerusalem, and as far as Illyricum,2085 I have fulfilled the word of peace. For I have taught
that in honour they should prefer one another;2086 I have taught those that are eminent and
rich not to be lifted up, and hope in uncertainty of riches, but to place their hope in God;2087
I have taught those in a middle station to be content with food and covering;2088 I have
taught the poor to rejoice in their own poverty; I have taught fathers to teach their children

instruction in the fear of the Lord, children to obey their parents in wholesome admonition;
2089 I have taught wives to love their own husbands, and to fear them as masters, and
husbands to observe fidelity to their wives; I have taught masters to treat their slaves with
clemency, and slaves to serve their own masters faithfully;2090 I have taught the churches
of the believers to reverence one almighty, invisible, and incomprehensible God. And this
teaching has been given me, not from men, nor through men, but through Jesus Christ,2091
who spoke to me out of heaven, who also has sent me to preach, saying to me, Go forth, for
I will be with thee; and all things, as many as thou shalt say or do, I shall make just.</p>
<p>Nero said: What sayest thou, Peter? He answered and said: All that Paul has said is
true.2092 For when he was a persecutor of the faith of Christ, a voice called him out of
heaven, and taught him the truth; for he was not an adversary of our faith from hatred, but
from ignorance. For there were before us false Christs, like Simon, false apostles, and false
prophets, who, contrary to the sacred writings, set themselves to make void the truth; and
against these it was necessary to have in readiness this man, who from his youth up set
himself to no other thing than to search out the mysteries of the divine law, by which2093
he might become a vindicator of truth and a persecutor of falsehood. Since, then, his persecution
was not on account of hatred, but on account of the vindication of the law, the very
truth out of heaven held intercourse with him, saying, I am the truth which you persecutest;
cease persecuting me. When, therefore, he knew that this was so, leaving off that which he
was vindicating, he began to vindicate this way of Christ which he was persecuting.</p>
<p>Simon said: O good emperor, take notice that these two have conspired against me; for
I am the truth, and they purpose evil against me. Peter said: There is no truth in thee; but
all thou sayest is false.</p>
<p>Nero said: Paul, what sayest thou? Paul said: Those things which thou hast heard from
Peter, believe to have been spoken by me also; for we purpose the same thing, for we have
the same Lord Jesus the Christ. Simon said: Dost thou expect me, O good emperor, to hold
an argument with these men, who have come to an agreement against me? And having
turned to the apostles of Christ, he said: Listen, Peter and Paul: if I can do nothing for you
here, we are going to the place where I must judge you. Paul said: O good emperor, see
what threats he holds out against us. Peter said: Why was it necessary to keep from laughing

outright at a foolish man, made the sport of demons, so as to suppose that he cannot be
made manifest?</p>
<p>Simon said: I spare you until I shall receive my power. Paul said: See if you will go out
hence safe. Peter said: If thou do not see, Simon, the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, thou
wilt not believe thyself not to be Christ. Simon said: Most sacred emperor, do not believe
them, for they are circumcised knaves. Paul said: Before we knew the truth, we had the
circumcision of the flesh; but when the truth appeared, in the circumcision of the heart we
both are circumcised, and circumcise. Peter said: If circumcision be a disgrace, why hast
thou been circumcised, Simon?</p>
<p>Nero said: Has, then, Simon also been circumcised? Peter said: For not otherwise
could he have deceived souls, unless he feigned himself to be a Jew, and made a show of
teaching the law of God. Nero said: Simon, thou, as I see, being carried away with envy,
persecutest these men. For, as it seems, there is great hatred between thee and their Christ;
and I am afraid that thou wilt be worsted by them, and involved in great evils. Simon said:
Thou art led astray, O emperor. Nero said: How am I led astray? What I see in thee, I say.
I see that thou art manifestly an enemy of Peter and Paul and their master.</p>
<p>Simon said: Christ was not Paul’s master. Paul said: Yes; through revelation He taught
me also. But tell me what I asked thee—Why wast thou circumcised? Simon said: Why
have you asked me this? Paul said: We have a reason for asking you this. Nero said: Why
art thou afraid to answer them? Simon said: Listen, O emperor. At that time circumcision
was enjoined by God when I received it. For this reason was I circumcised.</p>
<p>Paul said: Hearest thou, O good emperor, what has been said by Simon? If, therefore,
circumcision be a good thing, why hast thou, Simon, given up those who have been circumcised,
and forced them, after being condemned, to be put to death? Nero said: Neither
about you do I perceive anything good. Peter and Paul said: Whether this thought about
us be good or evil has no reference to the matter; but to us it was necessary that what our
Master promised should come to pass. Nero said: If I should not be willing? Peter said:
Not as thou willest, but as He promised to us.</p>
<p>Simon said: O good emperor, these men have reckoned upon thy clemency, and have
bound thee. Nero said: But neither hast thou yet made me sure about thyself. Simon said:
Since so many excellent deeds and signs have been shown to thee by me, I wonder how thou
shouldst be in doubt. Nero said: I neither doubt nor favour any of you; but answer me
rather what I ask.</p>
<p>Simon said: Henceforward I answer thee nothing. Nero said: Seeing that thou liest,
therefore thou sayest this. But if even I can do nothing to thee, God, who can, will do it.
Simon said: I no longer answer thee. Nero said: Nor do I consider thee to be anything:
for, as I perceive, thou art a liar in everything. But why do I say so much? The three of you

<pb n="1518"/>
show that your reasoning is uncertain; and thus in all things you have made me doubt, so
that I find that I can give credit to none of you.2094</p>
<p>Peter said: We preach one God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that has made the
heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that therein is, who is the true King; and of His
kingdom there shall be no end.2095 Nero said: What king is lord? Paul said: The Saviour
of all the nations. Simon said: I am he whom you speak of. Peter and Paul said: May it
never be well with thee, Simon, magician, and full of bitterness.</p>
<p>Simon said: Listen, O Cæsar Nero, that thou mayst know that these men are liars, and
that I have been sent from the heavens: to-morrow I go up into the heavens, that I may
make those who believe in me blessed, and show my wrath upon those who have denied
me. Peter and Paul said: Us long ago God called to His own glory; but thou, called by the
devil, hastenest to punishment. Simon said: Cæsar Nero, listen to me. Separate these
madmen from thee, in order that when I go into heaven to my father, I may be very merciful
to thee. Nero said: And whence shall we prove this, that thou goest away into heaven? Simon
said: Order a lofty tower to be made of wood, and of great beams, that I may go up upon
it, and that my angels may find me in the air; for they cannot come to me upon earth among
the sinners. Nero said: I will see whether thou wilt fulfil what thou sayest.</p>
<p>Then Nero ordered a lofty tower to be made in the Campus Martius, and all the people
and the dignities to be present at the spectacle. And on the following day, all the multitude
having come together, Nero ordered Peter and Paul to be present, to whom also he said:
Now the truth has to be made manifest. Peter and Paul said: We do not expose him, but
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whom he has falsely declared himself to be.</p>
<p>And Paul, having turned to Peter, said: It is my part to bend the knee, and to pray to
God; and thine to produce the effect, if thou shouldst see him attempting anything, because
thou wast first taken in hand2096 by the Lord. And Paul, bending his knees, prayed. And
Peter, looking stedfastly upon Simon, said: Accomplish what thou hast begun; for both thy
exposure and our call is at hand: for I see my Christ calling both me and Paul. Nero said:
And where will you go to against my will? Peter said: Whithersoever our Lord has called
us. Nero said: And who is your lord? Peter said: Jesus the Christ, whom I see calling us
to Himself. Nero said: Do you also then intend to go away to heaven? Peter said: If it shall
seem good to Him that calls us. Simon said: In order that thou mayst know, O emperor,
that these are deceivers, as soon as ever I ascend into heaven, I will send my angels to thee,
and will make thee come to me. Nero said: Do at once what thou sayest.</p>
<note type="footnote">2094 Or, to nothing.</note>
<note type="footnote">2095 Luke i. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">2096 Or, chosen.</note>

<pb n="1519"/>
<p>Then Simon went up upon the tower in the face of all, and, crowned with laurels, he
stretched forth his hands, and began to fly. And when Nero saw him flying, he said to Peter:
This Simon is true; but thou and Paul are deceivers. To whom Peter said: Immediately
shalt thou know that we are true disciples of Christ; but that he is not Christ, but a magician,
and a malefactor. Nero said: Do you still persist? Behold, you see him going up into
heaven. Then Peter, looking stedfastly upon Paul, said: Paul, look up and see. And Paul,
having looked up, full of tears, and seeing Simon flying, said: Peter, why art thou idle? finish
what thou hast begun; for already our Lord Jesus Christ is calling us. And Nero hearing
them, smiled a little, and said: These men see themselves worsted already, and are gone
mad. Peter said: Now thou shalt know that we are not mad. Paul said to Peter: Do at once
what thou doest.</p>
<p>And Peter, looking stedfastly against Simon, said: I adjure you, ye angels of Satan, who
are carrying him into the air, to deceive the hearts of the unbelievers, by the God that created
all things, and by Jesus Christ, whom on the third day He raised from the dead, no longer
from this hour to keep him up, but to let him go. And immediately, being let go, he fell into
a place called Sacra Via, that is, Holy Way, and was divided into four parts, having perished
by an evil fate.</p>
<p>Then Nero ordered Peter and Paul to be put in irons, and the body of Simon to be
carefully kept three days, thinking that he would rise on the third day. To whom Peter said:
He will no longer rise, since he is truly dead, being condemned to everlasting punishment.
And Nero said to him: Who commanded thee to do such a dreadful deed? Peter said: His
reflections and blasphemy against my Lord Jesus Christ have brought him into this gulf of
destruction. Nero said: I will destroy you by an evil taking off. Peter said: This is not in
thy power, even if it should seem good to thee to destroy us; but it is necessary that what
our Master promised to us should be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Then Nero, having summoned Agrippa the proprætor, said to him: It is necessary that
men introducing mischievous religious observances should die. Wherefore I order them
to take iron clubs,2097 and to be killed in the sea-fight. Agrippa the proprætor said: Most
sacred emperor, what thou hast ordered is not fitting for these men, since Paul seems innocent
beside Peter. Nero said: By what fate, then, shall they die? Agrippa answered and said: As
seems to me, it is just that Paul’s head should be cut off, and that Peter should be raised on
a cross as the cause of the murder. Nero said: Thou hast most excellently judged.</p>
<note type="footnote">2097 The text has κινάρας, artichokes, for which I have read κορυνας, clubs. Sea-fights were a favourite
spectacle of the Roman emperors (Suet., Nero, xii.; Claud., xxi.; Dom., iv.). The combatants were captives, or
persons condemned to death (Dion Cass., lx. 33).</note>

<pb n="1520"/>
<p>Then both Peter and Paul were led away from the presence of Nero. And Paul was beheaded
on the Ostesian road.2098</p>
<p>And Peter, having come to the cross, said: Since my Lord Jesus Christ, who came down
from the heaven upon the earth, was raised upon the cross upright,2099 and He has deigned
to call to heaven me, who am of the earth, my cross ought to be fixed head down most, so
as to direct my feet towards heaven; for I am not worthy to be crucified like my Lord. Then,
having reversed the cross, they nailed his feet up.</p>
<p>And the multitude was assembled reviling Cæsar, and wishing to kill him. But Peter
restrained them, saying:2100 A few days ago, being exhorted by the brethren, I was going
away; and my Lord Jesus Christ met me, and having adored Him, I said, Lord, whither art
Thou going? And He said to me, I am going to Rome to be crucified. And I said to Him,
Lord, wast Thou not crucified once for all? And the Lord answering, said, I saw thee fleeing
from death, and I wish to be crucified instead of thee. And I said, Lord, I go; I fulfil Thy
command. And He said to me, Fear not, for I am with thee.2101 On this account, then,
children, do not hinder my going; for already my feet are going on the road to heaven. Do
not grieve, therefore, but rather rejoice with me, for to-day I receive the fruit of my labours.
And thus speaking, he said: I thank Thee, good Shepherd, that the sheep which Thou hast
entrusted to me, sympathize with me; I ask, then, that with me they may have a part in Thy
kingdom.2102 And having thus spoken, he gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>And immediately there appeared men glorious and strange in appearance; and they

along with Marcellus, an illustrious man, who, having left Simon, had believed in Peter,
took up his body secretly, and put it under the terebinth near the place for the exhibition
of sea-fights in the place called the Vatican.2103</p>

<head>The Story of Perpetua.</head>
<p>And as Paul was being led away to be beheaded at a place about three miles from the
city, he was in irons. And there were three soldiers guarding him who were of a great family.
And when they had gone out of the gate about the length of a bow-shot, there met them a
God-fearing woman; and she, seeing Paul dragged along in irons, had compassion on him,
and wept bitterly. And the name of the woman was called Perpetua; and she was one-eyed.
And Paul, seeing her weeping, says to her: Give me thy handkerchief, and when I turn back
I shall give it to thee. And she, having taken the handkerchief, gave it to him willingly. And
the soldiers laughed, and said to the woman: Why dost thou wish, woman, to lose thy
handkerchief? Knowest thou not that he is going away to be beheaded? And Perpetua said
to them: I adjure you by the health of Cæsar to bind his eyes with this handkerchief when
you cut off his head. Which also was done. And they beheaded him at the place called
Aquæ Salviæ, near the pine tree. And as God had willed, before the soldiers came back, the
handkerchief, having on it drops of blood, was restored to the woman. And as she was
carrying it, straightway and immediately her eye was opened.</p>
<p>And the three soldiers who had cut off the head of Saint Paul, when after three hours
they came on the same day with the Bulla bringing it to Nero, having met Perpetua, they
said to her: What is it, woman? Behold, by thy confidence thou hast lost thy handkerchief.
But she said to them: I have both got my handkerchief, and my eye has recovered its sight.
And as the Lord, the God of Paul, liveth, I also have entreated him that I may be deemed
worthy to become the slave of his Lord. Then the soldiers who had the Bulla, recognising
the handkerchief, and seeing that her eye had been opened, cried out with a loud voice, as
if from one mouth, and said: We too are the slaves of Paul’s master. Perpetua therefore
having gone away, reported in the palace of the Emperor Nero that the soldiers who had
beheaded Paul said: We shall no longer go into the city, for we believe in Christ whom Paul
preached, and we are Christians. Then Nero, filled with rage, ordered Perpetua, who had
informed him of the soldiers, to be kept fast in irons; and as to the soldiers, he ordered one
to be beheaded outside of the gate about one mile from the city, another to be cut in two,
and the third to be stoned. And Perpetua was in the prison; and in this prison there was
kept Potentiana, a noble maiden, because she had said: I forsake my parents and all the
substance of my father, and I wish to become a Christian. She therefore joined herself to
Perpetua, and ascertained from her everything about Paul, and was in much anxiety about
the faith in Christ. And the wife of Nero was Potentiana’s sister; and she secretly informed
her about Christ, that those who believe in Him see everlasting joy, and that everything here
is temporary, but there eternal: so that also she fled out of the palace, and some of the senators’
wives with her. Then Nero, having inflicted many tortures upon Perpetua, at last tied
a great stone to her neck, and ordered her to be thrown over a precipice. And her remains

<pb n="1523"/>
lie at the Momentan2105 gate. And Potentiana also underwent many torments; and at last,
having made a furnace one day, they burned her.</p>

<head>Acts of Paul and Thecla.</head>
<p>As Paul was going up to Iconium after the flight from Antioch, his fellow-travellers
were Demas and Ermogenes, full of hypocrisy; and they were importunate with Paul,2106
as if they loved him. But Paul, looking only to the goodness of Christ, did them no harm,
but loved them exceedingly, so that he made the oracles of the Lord sweet to them in the
teaching both of the birth and the resurrection of the Beloved; and he gave them an account,
word for word, of the great things of Christ, how He2107 had been revealed to him.</p>
<p>And a certain man, by name Onesiphorus, hearing that Paul had come to Iconium,
went out to meet him with his children Silas and Zeno, and his wife Lectra, in order that he
might entertain him: for Titus had informed him what Paul was like in appearance: for he
had not seen him in the flesh, but only in the spirit. And he went along the road to Lystra,
and stood waiting for him, and kept looking at the passers by according to the description
of Titus. And he saw Paul coming, a man small in size, bald-headed, bandy-legged, wellbuilt,
2108 with eyebrows meeting, rather long-nosed, full of grace. For sometimes he seemed
like a man, and sometimes he had the countenance of an angel. And Paul, seeing Onesiphorus,
smiled; and Onesiphorus said: Hail, O servant of the blessed God! And he said: Grace
be with thee and thy house. And Demas and Ermogenes were jealous, and showed greater
hypocrisy; so that Demas said: Are not we of the blessed God, that thou hast not thus saluted
us? And Onesiphorus said: I do not see in you the fruit of righteousness; but if such you
be, come you also into my house and rest yourselves.</p>
<p>And Paul having gone into the house of Onesiphorus, there was great joy, and bending
of knees, and breaking of bread, and the word of God about self-control and the resurrection;
Paul saying: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God:2109 blessed are they that
have kept the flesh chaste, for they shall become a temple of God:2110 blessed are they that
control themselves, for God shall speak with them: blessed are they that have kept aloof
from this world, for they shall be called upright:2111 blessed are they that have wives as not
having them, for they shall receive God for their portion:2112 blessed are they that have the

fear of God, for they shall become angels of God:2113 blessed are they that have kept the
baptism, for they shall rest beside the Father and the Son: blessed are the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy,2114 and shall not see the bitter day of judgment: blessed are the bodies
of the virgins, for they shall be well pleasing to God, and shall not lose the reward of their
chastity; for the word of the Father shall become to them a work of salvation against the day
of His Son, and they shall have rest for ever and ever.2115</p>
<p>And while Paul was thus speaking in the midst of the church in the house of Onesiphorus,
a certain virgin Thecla, the daughter of Theocleia, betrothed to a man named Thamyris,
sitting at the window close by, listened night and day to the discourse of virginity and
prayer, and did not look away from the window, but paid earnest heed to the faith, rejoicing
exceedingly. And when she still saw many women going in beside Paul, she also had an
eager desire to be deemed worthy to stand in the presence of Paul, and to hear the word of
Christ; for never had she seen his figure, but heard his word only.</p>
<p>And as she did not stand away from the window, her mother sends to Thamyris; and
he comes gladly, as if already receiving her in marriage. And Theocleia said: I have a strange
story to tell thee, Thamyris; for assuredly for three days and three nights Thecla does not
rise from the window, neither to eat nor to drink; but looking earnestly as if upon some
pleasant sight, she is so devoted to a foreigner teaching deceitful and artful discourses, that
I wonder how a virgin of such modesty is so painfully put about. Thamyris, this man will
overturn the city of the Iconians, and thy Thecla too besides; for all the women and the
young men go in beside him, being taught to fear God and to live in chastity. Moreover
also my daughter, tied to the window like a spider, lays hold of what is said by Paul with a
strange eagerness and awful emotion; for the virgin looks eagerly at what is said by him,
and has been captivated. But do thou go near and speak to her, for she has been betrothed
to thee.</p>
<p>And Thamyris going near, and kissing her, but at the same time also being afraid of her
overpowering emotion, said: Thecla, my betrothed, why dost thou sit thus? and what sort
of feeling holds thee overpowered? Turn round to thy Thamyris, and be ashamed. Moreover
also her mother said the same things: Why dost thou sit thus looking down, my child, and
answering nothing, but like a mad woman? And they wept fearfully, Thamyris indeed for
the loss of a wife, and Theocleia of a child, and the maidservants of a mistress: there was
<note type="footnote">2113 Comp. Luke xx. 36.</note>

<note type="footnote">2115 Some mss. add the following beatitudes: Blessed are they that tremble at the words of God, for they
shall be comforted: blessed are they that have received the wisdom of Jesus Christ, for they shall be called the
sons of the Most High: blessed are they that through love of Christ have come out from conformity with the
world, for they shall judge the angels, and shall be blessed at the right hand of the Father.</note>

<pb n="1526"/>
accordingly much confusion in the house of mourning.2116 And while these things were
thus going on, Thecla did not turn round, but kept attending earnestly to the word of Paul.</p>
<p>And Thamyris starting up, went forth into the street, and kept watching those going in
to him and coming out. And he saw two men bitterly contending with each other; and he
said: Men, tell me who this is among you, leading astray the souls of young men, and deceiving
virgins, so that they do not marry, but remain as they are. I promise, therefore, to
give you money enough if you tell me about him; for I am the first man2117 of the city. And
Demas and Ermogenes said to him: Who this is, indeed, we do not know; but he deprives
young men of wives, and maidens of husbands, saying, There is for you a resurrection in
no other way, unless you remain chaste, and pollute not the flesh, but keep it chaste. And
Thamyris said to them: Come into my house, and rest yourselves. And they went to a
sumptuous dinner, and much wine, and great wealth, and a splendid table; and Thamyris
made them drink, from his love to Thecla, and his wish to get her as his wife. And
Thamyris said during the dinner: Ye men, what is his teaching, tell me, that I also may
know; for I am no little distressed about Thecla, because she thus loves the stranger, and I
am prevented from marrying.</p>
<p>Demas and Ermogenes said: Bring him before the governor Castelios on the charge of
persuading the multitudes to embrace the new teaching of the Christians, and he will speedily
destroy him, and thou shalt have Thecla as thy wife. And we shall teach thee that the resurrection
of which this man speaks has taken place, because it has already taken place in the
children which we have;2118 and we rose again when we came to the knowledge of the true
God.</p>
<p>And Thamyris, hearing these things, being filled with anger and rage, rising up early,
went to the house of Onesiphorus with archons and public officers, and a great crowd with
batons, saying: Thou hast corrupted the city of the Iconians, and her that was betrothed to
me, so that she will not have me: let us go to the governor Castelios. And all the multitude
said: Away with the magician; for he has corrupted all our wives, and the multitudes have
been persuaded to change their opinions.</p>
<p>And Thamyris, standing before the tribunal, said with a great shout: O proconsul, this
man, who he is we know not, who makes virgins averse to marriage; let him say before thee
on what2119 account he teaches these things. And Demas and Ermogenes said to Thamyris:
Say that he is a Christian, and thus thou wilt do away with him. But the proconsul stayed
his intention, and called Paul, saying: Who art thou, and what dost thou teach? for they

bring no small charges against thee. And Paul lifted up his voice, saying: Since I am this
day examined as to what I teach, listen, O proconsul: A living God, a God of retributions,
a jealous God, a God in need of nothing, consulting for the salvation of men, has sent me
that I may reclaim them from corruption and uncleanness, and from all pleasure, and from
death, that they may not sin. Wherefore God sent His own Son, whom I preach, and in
whom I teach men to rest their hope, who alone has had compassion upon a world led astray,
that they may be no longer under judgment, O proconsul, but may have faith, and the fear
of God, and the knowledge of holiness, and the love of truth. If, therefore, I teach what has
been revealed to me by God, wherein do I do wrong? And the proconsul having heard,
ordered Paul to be bound, and sent to prison, until, said he, I, being at leisure, shall hear
him more attentively.</p>
<p>And Thecla by night having taken off her bracelets, gave them to the gatekeeper; and
the door having been opened to her, she went into the prison; and having given the jailor a
silver mirror, she went in beside Paul, and, sitting at his feet, she heard the great things of
God. And Paul was afraid of nothing, but ordered his life in the confidence of God. And
her faith also was increased, and she kissed his bonds.</p>
<p>And when Thecla was sought for by her friends, and Thamyris, as if she had been lost,
was running up and down the streets, one of the gatekeeper’s fellow-slaves informed him
that she had gone out by night. And having gone out, they examined the gatekeeper; and
he said to them: She has gone to the foreigner into the prison. And having gone, they found
her, as it were, enchained by affection. And having gone forth thence, they drew the multitudes
together, and informed the governor of the circumstance. And he ordered Paul to be
brought to the tribunal; but Thecla was wallowing on the ground2120 in the place where he
sat and taught her in the prison; and he ordered her too to be brought to the tribunal. And
she came, exulting with joy. And the crowd, when Paul had been brought, vehemently cried
out: He is a magician! away with him! But the proconsul gladly heard Paul upon the holy
works of Christ. And having called a council, he summoned Thecla, and said to her: Why
dost thou not obey Thamyris, according to the law of the Iconians? But she stood looking
earnestly at Paul. And when she gave no answer, her mother cried out, saying: Burn the
wicked wretch; burn in the midst of the theatre her that will not marry, in order that all the
women that have been taught by this man may be afraid.</p>
<p>And the governor was greatly moved; and having scourged Paul, he cast him out of the
city, and condemned Thecla to be burned. And immediately the governor went away to
the theatre, and all the crowd went forth to the spectacle of Thecla. But as a lamb in the
wilderness looks round for the shepherd, so she kept searching for Paul. And having looked
upon the crowd, she saw the Lord sitting in the likeness of Paul, and said: As I am unable
<note type="footnote">2120 i.e., in sign of grief.</note>

<pb n="1528"/>
to endure my lot, Paul has come to see me. And she gazed upon him with great earnestness,
and he went up into heaven. But the maid-servants2121 and virgins brought the faggots, in
order that Thecla might be burned. And when she came in naked, the governor wept, and
wondered at the power2122 that was in her. And the public executioners arranged the faggots
for her to go up on the pile. And she, having made the sign of the cross, went up on the
faggots; and they lighted them. And though a great fire was blazing, it did not touch her;
for God, having compassion upon her, made an underground rumbling, and a cloud overshadowed
them from above, full of water and hail; and all that was in the cavity of it was
poured out, so that many were in danger of death. And the fire was put out, and Thecla
saved.</p>
<p>And Paul was fasting with Onesiphorus and his wife, and his children, in a new tomb,
as they were going from Iconium to Daphne. And when many days were past, the fasting
children said to Paul: We are hungry, and we cannot buy loaves; for Onesiphorus had left
the things of the world, and followed Paul, with all his house. And Paul, having taken off
his cloak, said: Go, my child, buy more loaves, and bring them. And when the child was
buying, he saw Thecla their neighbour, and was astonished, and said: Thecla, whither art
thou going? And she said: I have been saved from the fire, and am following Paul. And
the boy said: Come, I shall take thee to him; for he is distressed about thee, and is praying
six days. And she stood beside the tomb where Paul was with bended knees, and praying,
and saying: O Saviour Christ, let not the fire touch Thecla, but stand by her, for she is Thine.
And she, standing behind him, cried out: O Father, who hast made the heaven and the
earth, the Father of Thy holy Son, I bless Thee that Thou hast saved me that I may see Paul.
And Paul, rising up, saw her, and said: O God, that knowest the heart, the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, I bless Thee that Thou, having heard me, hast done quickly what I wished.</p>
<p>And they had five loaves, and herbs, and water; and they rejoiced in the holy works of
Christ. And Thecla said to Paul: I shall cut my hair, and follow thee whithersoever thou
mayst go. And he said: It is a shameless age, and thou art beautiful. I am afraid lest another
temptation come upon thee worse than the first, and that thou withstand it not, but be
cowardly. And Thecla said: Only give me the seal2123 in Christ, and temptation shall not
touch me. And Paul said: Thecla, wait with patience, and thou shalt receive the water.</p>
<p>And Paul sent away Onesiphorus and all his house to Iconium; and thus, having taken
Thecla, he went into Antioch. And as they were going in, a certain Syriarch, Alexander by
name, seeing Thecla, became enamoured of her, and tried to gain over Paul by gifts and
presents. But Paul said: I know not the woman whom thou speakest of, nor is she mine.

But he, being of great power, himself embraced her in the street. But she would not endure
it, but looked about for Paul. And she cried out bitterly, saying: Do not force the stranger;
do not force the servant of God. I am one of the chief persons of the Iconians; and because
I would not have Thamyris, I have been cast out of the city. And taking hold of Alexander,
she tore his cloak, and pulled off his crown, and made him a laughing-stock. And he, at the
same time loving her, and at the same time ashamed of what had happened, led her before
the governor; and when she had confessed that she had done these things, he condemned
her to the wild beasts. And the women were struck with astonishment, and cried out beside
the tribunal: Evil judgment! impious judgment! And she asked the governor, that, said she,
I may remain pure until I shall fight with the wild beasts. And a certain Tryphæna,2124
whose daughter was dead, took her into keeping, and had her for a consolation.</p>
<p>And when the beasts were exhibited, they bound her to a fierce lioness; and Tryphæna
accompanied her. But the lioness, with Thecla sitting upon her, licked her feet; and all the
multitude was astonished. And the charge on her inscription was: Sacrilegious. And the
women cried out from above: An impious sentence has been passed in this city! And after
the exhibition, Tryphæna again receives her. For her daughter Falconilla had died, and said
to her in a dream: Mother, thou shalt have this stranger Thecla in my place, in order that
she may pray concerning me, and that I may be transferred to the place of the just.</p>
<p>And when, after the exhibition, Tryphæna received her, at the same time indeed she
grieved that she had to fight with the wild beasts on the day following; and at the same time,
loving her as much as her daughter Falconilla, she said: My second child Thecla, come and
pray for my child, that she may live for ever; for this I saw in my sleep. And she, nothing
hesitating, lifted up her voice, and said: God most high,2125 grant to this woman according
to her wish, that her daughter Falconilla may live for ever. And when Thecla had thus
spoken, Tryphæna lamented, considering so much beauty thrown to the wild beasts.</p>
<p>And when it was dawn, Alexander came to take her, for it was he that gave the hunt,2126
saying: The governor is sitting, and the crowd is in uproar against us. Allow me to take
away her that is to fight with the wild beasts. And Tryphæna cried aloud, so that he even
fled, saying: A second mourning for my Falconilla has come upon my house and there is
no one to help; neither child, for she is dead, nor kinsman, for I am a widow. God of Thecla,
help her!</p>
<p>And immediately the governor sends an order that Thecla should be brought. And
Tryphæna, taking her by the hand, said: My daughter Falconilla, indeed, I took away to the

tomb; and thee, Thecla, I am taking to the wild-beast fight. And Thecla wept bitterly, saying:
O Lord, the God in whom I believe, to whom I have fled for refuge, who deliveredst me
from the fire, do Thou grant a recompense to Tryphæna, who has had compassion on Thy
servant, and because she has kept me pure. Then a tumult arose, and a cry of the people,
and the women sitting together, the one saying: Away with the sacrilegious person! the
others saying: Let the city be raised2127 against this wickedness. Take off all of us, O proconsul!
Cruel sight! evil sentence!</p>
<p>And Thecla, having been taken out of the hand of Tryphæna, was stripped, and received
a girdle,2128 and was thrown into the arena, and lions and bears and a fierce lioness were
let loose upon her; and the lioness having run up to her feet, lay down; and the multitude
of the women cried aloud. And a bear ran upon her; but the lioness, meeting the bear, tore
her to pieces. And again a lion that had been trained against men, which belonged to Alexander,
ran upon her; and she, the lioness, encountering the lion, was killed along with him.
And the women made great lamentation, since also the lioness, her protector, was dead.</p>
<p>Then they send in many wild beasts, she standing and stretching forth her hands, and
praying. And when she had finished her prayer, she turned and saw a ditch full of water,
and said: Now it is time to wash myself. And she threw herself in, saying: In the name of
Jesus Christ I am baptized on my last day. And the women seeing, and the multitude, wept,
saying: Do not throw thyself into the water; so that also the governor shed tears, because
the seals were going to devour such beauty. She then threw herself in in the name of Jesus
Christ; but the seals having seen the glare of the fire of lightning, floated about dead. And
there was round her, as she was naked, a cloud of fire; so that neither could the wild beasts
touch her, nor could she be seen naked.</p>
<p>And the women, when other wild beasts were being thrown in, wailed. And some threw
sweet-smelling herbs, others nard, others cassia, others amomum, so that there was
abundance of perfumes. And all the wild beasts that had been thrown in, as if they had been
withheld by sleep, did not touch her; so that Alexander said to the governor: I have bulls
exceedingly terrible; let us bind to them her that is to fight with the beasts. And the governor,
looking gloomy, turned, and said: Do what thou wilt. And they bound her by the feet
between them, and put red-hot irons under the privy parts of the bulls, so that they, being
rendered more furious, might kill her. They rushed about, therefore; but the burning flame
consumed the ropes, and she was as if she had not been bound. But Tryphæna fainted
standing beside the arena, so that the crowd said: Queen Tryphæna is dead. And the governor
put a stop to the games, and the city was in dismay. And Alexander entreated the

governor, saying: Have mercy both on me and the city, and release this woman. For if
Cæsar hear of these things, he will speedily destroy the city also along with us, because his
kinswoman Queen Tryphæna has died beside the Abaci.2129</p>
<p>And the governor summoned Thecla out of the midst of the wild beasts, and said to
her: Who art thou? and what is there about thee, that not one of the wild beasts touches
thee? And she said: I indeed am a servant of the living God; and as to what there is about
me, I have believed in the Son of God, in whom He is well pleased; wherefore not one of the
beasts has touched me. For He alone is the end2130 of salvation, and the basis of immortal
life; for He is a refuge to the tempest-tossed, a solace to the afflicted, a shelter to the despairing;
and, once for all, whoever shall not believe on Him, shall not live for ever.</p>
<p>And the governor having heard this, ordered her garments to be brought, and to be put
on. And Thecla said: He that clothed me naked among the wild beasts, will in the day of
judgment clothe thee with salvation. And taking the garments, she put them on. The governor
therefore immediately issued an edict, saying: I release to you the God-fearing Thecla,
the servant of God. And the women shouted aloud, and with one mouth returned thanks
to God, saying: There is one God, the God of Thecla; so that the foundations of the theatre
were shaken by their voice. And Tryphæna having received the good news, went to meet
the holy Thecla, and said: Now I believe that the dead are raised: now I believe that my
child lives. Come within, and I shall assign to thee all that is mine. She therefore went in
along with her, and rested eight days, having instructed her in the word of God, so that most
even of the maid-servants believed. And there was great joy in the house.</p>
<p>And Thecla kept seeking Paul; and it was told her that he was in Myra of Lycia. And
taking young men and maidens, she girded herself; and having sewed the tunic so as to make
a man’s cloak, she came to Myra, and found Paul speaking the word of God. And Paul was
astonished at seeing her, and the crowd with her, thinking that some new trial was coming
upon her. And when she saw him, she said: I have received the baptism, Paul; for He that
wrought along with thee for the Gospel has wrought in me also for baptism. And Paul,
taking her, led her to the house of Hermæus, and hears everything from her, so that those
that heard greatly wondered, and were comforted, and prayed over Tryphæna. And she
rose up, and said: I am going to Iconium. And Paul said: Go, and teach the word of God.
And Tryphæna sent her much clothing and gold, so that she left to Paul many things for
the service of the poor.</p>
<p>And she went to Iconium. And she goes into the house of Onesiphorus, and fell upon
the pavement where Paul used to sit and teach her, and wept, saying: God of myself and of
this house, where Thou didst make the light to shine upon me, O Christ Jesus, the Son of

the living God, my help in the fire, my help among the wild beasts, Thou art glorified for
ever. Amen. And she found Thamyris dead, but her mother alive. And having sent for her
mother, she said: Theocleia, my mother, canst thou believe that the Lord liveth in the
heavens? For whether thou desirest wealth, God gives it to thee through me; or thy child,
I am standing beside thee. And having thus testified, she departed to Seleucia, and dwelt
in a cave seventy-two years, living upon herbs and water. And she enlightened many by
the word of God.</p>
<p>And certain men of the city, being Greeks by religion, and physicians by profession,
sent to her insolent young men to destroy2131 her. For they said: She is a virgin, and serves
Artemis, and from this she has virtue in healing. And by the providence of God she entered
into the rock alive, and went under ground. And she departed to Rome to see Paul, and
found that he had fallen asleep.2132 And after staying there no long time, she rested in a
glorious sleep; and she is buried about two or three stadia from the tomb of her master Paul.</p>
<p>She was cast, then, into the fire when seventeen years old, and among the wild beasts
when eighteen. And she was an ascetic in the cave, as has been said, seventy-two years, so
that all the years of her life were ninety. And having accomplished many cures, she rests in
the place of the saints, having fallen asleep on the twenty-fourth of the month of September
in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and strength for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>Instead of the last two sections, the ms. which Dr. Grabe used has the following:—</p>
<p>And a cloud of light guided her. And having come into Seleucia, she went forth outside
of the city one stadium. And she was afraid of them also, for they worshipped idols. And
it guided her to the mountain called Calamon or Rhodeon; and having there found a cave,
she went into it. And she was there many years, and underwent many and grievous trials
by the devil, and bore them nobly, being assisted by Christ. And some of the well-born
women, having learned about the virgin Thecla, went to her, and learned the oracles of God.
And many of them bade adieu to the world, and lived an ascetic life with her. And a good
report was spread everywhere concerning her, and cures were done by her. All the city,
therefore, and country round, having known this, brought their sick to the mountain; and
before they came near the door they were speedily released from whatever disease they were
afflicted by; and the unclean spirits went out shrieking, and all received their own in health,
glorifying God, who had given such grace to the virgin Thecla. The physicians, therefore,
of the city of the Seleucians were thought nothing of, having lost their trade, and no one
any longer had regard to them; and being filled with envy and hatred, they plotted against
<note type="footnote">2131 Or, corrupt.</note>
<note type="footnote">2132 i.e., that he was dead.</note>

<pb n="1533"/>
the servant of Christ, what they should do to her. The devil then suggests to them a wicked
device; and one day, being assembled, and having taken counsel, they consult with each
other, saying: This virgin is a priestess of the great goddess Artemis; and if she ask anything
of her, she hears her as being a virgin, and all the gods love her. Come, then, let us take men
of disorderly lives, and make them drunk with much wine, and let us give them much gold,
and say to them, If you can corrupt and defile her, we shall give you even more money. The
physicians therefore said to themselves, that if they should be able to defile her, neither the
gods nor Artemis would listen to her in the case of the sick. They therefore did so. And
the wicked men, having gone to the mountain, and rushed upon the cave like lions, knocked
at the door. And the holy martyr Thecla opened, emboldened by the God in whom she
believed; for she knew of their plot beforehand. And she says to them: What do you want,
my children? And they said: Is there one here called Thecla? And she said: What do you
want with her? They say to her: We want to sleep with her. The blessed Thecla says to
them: I am a humble old woman, but the servant of my Lord Jesus Christ; and even though
you want to do something to me out of place, you cannot. They say to her: It is impossible
for us not to do to thee what we want. And having said this, they laid fast hold of her, and
wished to insult her. And she says to them with mildness: Wait, my children, that you may
see the glory of the Lord. And being laid hold of by them, she looked up into heaven, and
said: God, terrible and incomparable, and glorious to Thine adversaries, who didst deliver
me out of the fire, who didst not give me up to Thamyris, who didst not give me up to Alexander,
who didst deliver me from the wild beasts, who didst save me in the abyss, who hast
everywhere worked with me, and glorified Thy name in me, now also deliver me from these
lawless men, and let me not insult my virginity, which through Thy name I have preserved
till now, because I love Thee, and desire Thee, and adore Thee, the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost for ever. Amen. And there came a voice out of the heaven, saying: Fear
not, Thecla, my true servant, for I am with thee. Look and see where an opening has been
made before thee, for there shall be for thee an everlasting house, and there thou shalt obtain
shelter. And the blessed Thecla regarding it, saw the rock opened as far as to allow a man
to enter, and did according to what had been said to her: and nobly fleeing from the lawless
ones entered into the rock; and the rock was straightway shut together, so that not even a
joining appeared. And they, beholding the extraordinary wonder, became as it were distracted;
and they were not able to detain the servant of God, but only caught hold of her veil,
and were able to tear off a certain part; and that by the permission of God for the faith of
those seeing the venerable place, and for a blessing in the generations afterwards to those
that believe in our Lord Jesus Christ out of a pure heart.</p>
<p>Thus, then, suffered the first martyr of God, and apostle, and virgin, Thecla, who came
from Iconium at eighteen years old; and with the journeying, and the going round, and the
retirement in the mountain, she lived other seventy-two years. And when the Lord took

<pb n="1534"/>
her, she was ninety years old. And thus is her consummation. And her holy commemoration
is on the twenty-fourth of the month of September, to the glory of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<head>The Acts of Barnabus.</head>
<head>The Journeyings and Martyrdom of St. Barnabas the Apostle.</head>
<p>Since from the descent of the presence of our Saviour Jesus Christ, the unwearied and
benevolent and mighty Shepherd and Teacher and Physician, I beheld and saw the ineffable
and holy and unspotted mystery of the Christians, who hold the hope in holiness, and who
have been sealed; and since I have zealously served Him, I have deemed it necessary to give
account of the mysteries which I have heard and seen.</p>
<p>I John, accompanying the holy apostles Barnabas and Paul, being formerly a servant of
Cyrillus the high priest of Jupiter, but now having received the gift of the Holy Spirit through
Paul and Barnabas and Silas, who were worthy of the calling, and who baptized me in
Iconium. After I was baptized, then, I saw a certain man standing clothed in white raiment;
and he said to me: Be of good courage, John, for assuredly thy name shall be changed to
Mark, and thy glory shall be proclaimed in all the world. And the darkness in thee has
passed away from thee, and there has been given to thee understanding to know the mysteries
of God.</p>
<p>And when I saw the vision, becoming greatly terrified, I went to the feet of Barnabas,
and related to him the mysteries which I had seen and heard from that man. And the Apostle
Paul was not by when I disclosed the mysteries. And Barnabas said to me: Tell no one the
miracle which thou hast seen. For by me also this night the Lord stood, saying, Be of good
courage: for as thou hast given thy life for my name to death and banishment from thy nation,
thus also shalt thou be made perfect. Moreover, as for the servant who is with you,
take him also with thyself; for he has certain mysteries. Now then, my child, keep to thyself
the things which thou hast seen and heard; for a time will come for thee to reveal them.2133</p>
<p>And I, having been instructed in these things by him, remained in Iconium2134 many
days; for there was there a holy man and a pious, who also entertained us, whose house also
Paul had sanctified. Thence, therefore, we came to Seleucia, and after staying three days
sailed away to Cyprus; and I was ministering to them until we had gone round all Cyprus.
And setting sail from Cyprus, we landed in Perga of Pamphylia. And there I then stayed
about two months, wishing to sail to the regions of the West; and the Holy Spirit did not
allow me. Turning, therefore, I again sought the apostles; and having learned that they were
in Antioch, I went to them.</p>
<note type="footnote">2133 Or, will come to reveal thee.</note>
<note type="footnote">2134 One ms. has Jerusalem, and adds, and we came to Antioch, which suits the geography better.</note>

<pb n="1536"/>
<p>And I found Paul in bed in Antioch from the toil of the journey, who also seeing me,
was exceedingly grieved on account of my delaying in Pamphylia. And Barnabas coming,
encouraged him, and tasted bread, and he took a little of it. And they preached the word
of the Lord, and enlightened many of the Jews and Greeks. And I only attended to them,
and was afraid of Paul to come near him, both because he held me as having spent much
time in Pamphylia, and because he was quite enraged against me. And I gave repentance
on my knees upon the earth to Paul, and he would not endure it. And when I remained for
three Sabbaths in entreaty and prayer on my knees, I was unable to prevail upon him about
myself; for his great grievance against me was on account of my keeping several parchments
in Pamphylia.</p>
<p>And when it came to pass that they finished teaching in Antioch, on the first of the week
they took counsel together to set out for the places of the East, and after that to go into
Cyprus, and oversee all the churches in which they had spoken the word of God. And
Barnabas entreated Paul to go first to Cyprus, and oversee his own in his village; and Lucius2135
entreated him to take the oversight of his city Cyrene. And a vision was seen by
Paul in sleep, that he should hasten to Jerusalem, because the brethren expected him there.
But Barnabas urged that they should go to Cyprus, and pass the winter, and then that they
should go to Jerusalem at the feast. Great contention, therefore, arose between them.2136
And Barnabas urged me also to accompany them, on account of my being their servant
from the beginning, and on account of my having served them in all Cyprus until they came
to Perga of Pamphylia; and I there had remained many days. But Paul cried out against
Barnabas, saying: It is impossible for him to go with us. And those who were with us there
urged me also to accompany them, because there was a vow upon me to follow them to the
end. So that Paul said to Barnabas: If thou wilt take John who also is surnamed Mark with
thee, go another road; for he shall not come with us. And Barnabas coming to himself, said:
The grace of God does not desert2137 him who has once served the Gospel and journeyed
with us. If, therefore, this be agreeable to thee, Father Paul, I take him and go. And he said:
Go thou in the grace of Christ, and we in the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, bending their knees, they prayed to God. And Paul, groaning aloud, wept,
and in like manner also Barnabas, saying to one another: It would have been good for us,
as at first, so also at last, to work in common among men; but since it has thus seemed good
to thee, Father Paul, pray for me that my labour may be made perfect to commendation:
for thou knowest how I have served thee also to the grace of Christ that has been given to
thee. For I go to Cyprus, and hasten to be made perfect;2138 for I know that I shall no more

see thy face, O Father Paul. And falling on the ground at his feet, he wept long. And Paul
said to him: The Lord stood by me also this night, saying, Do not force Barnabas not to go
to Cyprus, for there it has been prepared for him to enlighten many; and do thou also, in
the grace that has been given to thee, go to Jerusalem to worship in the holy place, and there
it shall be shown thee where thy martyrdom has been prepared. And we saluted one another,
and Barnabas took me to himself.</p>
<p>And having come down to Laodiceia,2139 we sought to cross to Cyprus; and having
found a ship going to Cyprus, we embarked. And when we had set sail, the wind was found
to be contrary. And we came to Corasium;2140 and having gone down to the shore where
there was a fountain, we rested there, showing ourselves to no one, that no one might know
that Barnabas had separated from Paul. And having set sail from Corasium, we came to
the regions of Isauria, and thence came to a certain island called Pityusa;2141 and a storm
having come on, we remained there three days; and a certain pious man entertained us, by
name Euphemus, whom also Barnabas instructed in many things in the faith, with all his
house.</p>
<p>And thence we sailed past the Aconesiæ,2142 and came to the city of Anemurium; and
having gone into it, we found two Greeks. And coming to us, they asked whence and who
we were. And Barnabas said to them: If you wish to know whence and who we are, throw
away the clothing which you have, and I shall put on you clothing which never becomes
soiled; for neither is there in it anything filthy, but it is altogether splendid. And being astonished
at the saying, they asked us: What is that garment which you are going to give us?
And Barnabas said to them: If you shall confess your sins, and submit yourselves to our
Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive that garment which is incorruptible for ever. And being
pricked at heart by the Holy Spirit, they fell at his feet, entreating and saying: We beseech
thee, father, give us that garment; for we believe in the living and true God whom thou
proclaimest. And leading them down to2143 the fountain, he baptized them into the name
of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. And they knew that they were clothed with power,
and a holy robe. And having taken from me one robe, he put it on the one; and his own
robe he put on the other. And they brought money to him, and straightway Barnabas distributed
it to the poor. And from them also the sailors were able to gain many things.2144</p>

<p>And they having come down to the shore, he spoke to them the word of God; and he
having blessed them, we saluted them, and went on board the ship. And the one of them
who was named Stephanus wished to accompany us, and Barnabas did not permit him.
And we, having gone across, sailed down to Cyprus by night; and having come to the place
called Crommyacita,2145 we found Timon and Ariston the temple servants, at whose house
also we were entertained.</p>
<p>And Timon was afflicted by much fever. And having laid our hands upon him, we
straightway removed his fever, having called upon the name of the Lord Jesus. And Barnabas
had received documents from Matthew, a book of the word2146 of God, and a narrative of
miracles and doctrines. This Barnabas laid upon the sick in each place that we came to, and
it immediately made a cure of their sufferings.</p>
<p>And when we had come to Lapithus,2147 and an idol festival2148 being celebrated in the
theatre, they did not allow us to go into the city, but we rested a little at the gate. And Timon,
after he rose up from his disease, came with us. And having gone forth from Lapithus, we
travelled through the mountains, and came to the city of Lampadistus, of which also Timon
was a native; in addition to whom, having found also that Heracleius was there, we were
entertained by him. He was of the city of Tamasus,2149 and had come to visit his relations;
and Barnabas, looking stedfastly at him, recognised him, having met with him formerly at
Citium with Paul; to whom also the Holy Spirit was given at baptism, and he changed his
name to Heracleides. And having ordained him bishop over Cyprus, and having confirmed
the church in Tamasus, we left him in the house of his brethren that dwelt there.</p>
<p>And having crossed the mountain called Chionodes,2150 we came to Old Paphos, and
there found Rhodon, a temple servant, who also, having himself believed, accompanied us.
And we met a certain Jew, by name Barjesus, coming from Paphos, who also recognised
Barnabas, as having been formerly with Paul. He did not wish us to go into Paphos; but
having turned away, we came to Curium.2151</p>
<p>And we found that a certain abominable race was being performed2152 in the road near
the city, where a multitude of women and men naked were performing the race. And there
was great deception and error in that place. And Barnabas turning, rebuked it; and the

western part fell, so that many were wounded, and many of them also died and the rest fled
to the temple of Apollo, which was close at hand in the city, which was called sacred.2153
And when we came near the temple, a great multitude of Jews who were there, having been
put up to it by Barjesus, stood outside of the city, and did not allow us to go into the city;
but we spent the evening under a tree near the city, and rested there.</p>
<p>And on the following day, we came to a certain village where Aristoclianus dwelt. He
being a leper, had been cleansed in Antioch, whom also Paul and Barnabas sealed to be a
bishop, and sent to his village in Cyprus, because there were many Greeks there. And we
were entertained in the cave by him in the mountain, and there we remained one day. And
thence we came to Amathus and there was a great multitude of Greeks in the temple in the
mountain, low women and men pouring libations. There also Barjesus, getting the start of
us, gained over the nation of the Jews, and did not allow us to enter into the city; but a certain
widow woman, eighty years old, being outside of the city, and she also not worshipping the
idols, coming forward to us, took us into her house one hour. And when we came out we
shook the dust off our feet over against that temple where the libation of the abominable
took place.</p>
<p>And having gone out thence, we came through desert places, and Timon also accompanied
us. And having come to Citium, and there being a great uproar there also in their
hippodrome, having learned this, we came forth out of the city, having all shaken the dust
off our feet; for no one received us, except that we rested one hour in the gate near the
aqueduct.</p>
<p>And having set sail in a ship from Citium, we came to Salamis, and landed in the socalled
islands, where there was a place full of idols; and there there took place high festivals2154
and libations. And having found Heracleides there again, we instructed him to
proclaim the Gospel of God, and to set up churches, and ministers in them. And having
gone into Salamis, we came to the synagogue near the place called Biblia; and when we had
gone into it, Barnabas, having unrolled the Gospel which he had received from Matthew
his fellow-labourer, began to teach the Jews.</p>
<p>And Barjesus, having arrived after two days, after not a few Jews had been instructed,
was enraged, and brought together all the multitude of the Jews; and they having laid hold
of Barnabas, wished to hand him over to Hypatius, the governor of Salamis. And having
bound him to take him away to the governor, and a pious Jebusite,2155 a kinsman of Nero,
having come to Cyprus, the Jews, learning this, took Barnabas by night, and bound him

with a rope by the neck; and having dragged him to the hippodrome from the synagogue,
and having gone out of the city, standing round him, they burned him with fire, so that even
his bones became dust. And straightway that night, having taken his dust, they cast it into
a cloth; and having secured it with lead, they intended to throw it into the sea. But I, finding
an opportunity in the night, and being able along with Timon and Rhodon to carry it. we
came to a certain place, and having found a cave, put it down there, where the nation of the
Jebusites formerly dwelt. And having found a secret place in it, we put it away, with the
documents which he had received from Matthew. And it was the fourth hour of the night
of the second of the week.2156</p>
<p>And when we were hid in the place, the Jews made no little search after us; and having
almost found us, they pursued us as far as the village of the Ledrians; and we, having found
there also a cave near the village, took refuge in it, and thus escaped them. And we were
hid in the cave three days; and the Jews having gone away, we came forth and left the place
by night. And taking with us Ariston and Rhodon, we came to the village of Limnes.2157</p>
<p>And having come to the shore, we found an Egyptian ship; and having embarked in it,
we landed at Alexandria. And there I remained, teaching the brethren that came the word
of the Lord, enlightening them, and preaching what I had been taught by the apostles of
Christ, who also baptized me into the name of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost; who also
changed my name to Mark in the water of baptism, by which also I hope to bring many to
the glory of God through His grace; because to Him is due honour and everlasting glory.
Amen.</p>

<head>The Acts of Philip.
Of the Journeyings of Philip the Apostle.</head>
<head>From the Fifteenth Acts Until the End, and Among Them the Martyrdom.</head>
<p>About the time when the Emperor Trajan received the government of the Romans, after
Simon the son of Clopas, who was bishop of Jerusalem, had suffered martyrdom in the
eighth year of his reign, being the second bishop of the church there after James who bore
the name of brother of the Lord,2159 Philip the apostle, going through the cities and regions
of Lydia and Asia, preached to all the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>And having come to the city of Ophioryma, which is called Hierapolis of Asia, he was
entertained by a certain believer, Stachys by name. And there was with him also Bartholomew,
one of the seventy disciples of the Lord, and his sister Mariamme, and his disciples
that followed him. All the men of the city therefore, having left their work, ran to the house
of Stachys, hearing about the works which Philip did. And many men and women having
assembled in the house of Stachys, Philip along with Bartholomew taught them the things
of Jesus.</p>
<p>And Philip’s sister Mariamme, sitting in the entry of the house of Stachys, addressed
herself to those coming, persuading them to listen to the apostles, saying to them: Our
brethren, and sons of my Father in heaven, ye are the excellent riches, and the substance of
the city above, the delight of the habitation which God has prepared for those that love
Him. Trample under foot the snares of the enemy, the writhing serpent. For his path is
crooked, since he is the son of the wicked one, and the poison of wickedness is in him; and
his father is the devil, the author of death, and his mother corruption; rage in his eyes and
destruction in his mouth, and his path is Hades. Wherefore flee from him that has no substance,
the shapeless one that has no shape in all the creation, whether in the heaven or in
the earth, whether in the flying creatures or the beasts. For everything is taken away from
his shape; for among the beasts of the earth and the fowls of the heaven is the knowledge of
him, that the serpent trails his belly and his breast; and Tartarus is his dwelling-place, and
he goes in the darkness, since he has confidence in nothing.2160 Flee therefore from him,

that his poison may not be poured out into your mouth. But be rather believing, holy, of
good works, having no deceit. Take away from yourselves the wicked disposition, that is,
the evil desires through which the serpent, the wicked dragon, the prince of evil, has produced
the pasture of destruction and death for the soul, since all the desire of the wicked has proceeded
from him. And this is the root of iniquity, the maintenance of evils, the death of
souls: for the desire of the enemy is armed against the believers, and comes forth from the
darkness, and walks in the darkness, taking in hand to war with those who are in the light.
For this is the beginning of concupiscence.2161 Wherefore you who wish to come to us,
and the rather that God has come through us to you as a father to his own children, wishing
to have mercy upon you, and to deliver you from the wicked snare of the enemy, flee from
the evil lusts of the enemy, and cast them completely out of your mind, hating openly the
father of evils, and loving Jesus, who is light, and life, and truth, and the Saviour of all who
desire Him. Having run, therefore, to Him, take hold of Him in love, that He may bring
you up out of the pit of the wicked, and having cleansed you, set you blameless, living in
truth, in the presence of His Father.</p>
<p>And all these things Philip said to the multitudes that had come together to worship as
in old times the serpents and the viper, of which also they set up images and worshipped
them. Wherefore also they called Hierapolis Ophioryma.2162 And these things having been
said by Philip, Bartholomew and Mariamme and his disciples, and Stachys being along with
him, all the people gave ear, and a great multitude of them fleeing from the enemy were
turned to Jesus, and were added to Philip and those about him. And the faithful were the
more confirmed in the love of Christ.</p>
<p>And Nicanora, the wife of the proconsul, lying in bed under various diseases, especially
of the eyes, having heard about the Apostle Philip and his teaching, believed in the Lord.
For she had even before this heard about Him; and having called upon His name, she was
released from the troubles that afflicted her. And rising up, she went forth out of her house
through the side door, carried by her own slaves in a silver litter, and went into the house
of Stachys, where the apostles were.</p>
<p>And when she came before the gate of the house, Mariamme, the sister of Philip the
apostle, seeing her, spoke to her in the Hebrew tongue before Philip and Bartholomew, and
all the multitude of those who had believed, saying: Alemakan, ikasame, marmare,
nachaman,2163 mastranan, achaman; which is, Daughter of the father, thou art my mistress,
thou hast been given as a pledge to the serpent; but Jesus our Redeemer has come to deliver
thee through us, to break thy bands, and cut them, and to remove them from thee from

their root, because thou art my sister, one mother brought us forth twins. Thou hast forsaken
thy father, thou hast forsaken the path leading thee to the dwelling-place of thy mother,
being in error; thou hast left the temple of that deception, and of the temporary glory, and
hast come to us, fleeing from the enemy, because he is the dwelling-place of death. Behold,
now thy Redeemer has come to redeem thee; Christ the Sun of righteousness has risen upon
thee, to enlighten thee.2164</p>
<p>And when Nicanora, standing before the door, heard these things, she took courage
before all, crying out, and saying: I am a Hebrew, and a daughter of the Hebrews; speak
with me in the language of my fathers. For, having heard the preaching of my fathers, I was
straightway cured of the disease and the troubles that encompassed me. I therefore adore
the goodness of God who has caused you to be spoiled even to this city, on account of His
true stone2165 held in honour, in order that through you we may receive the knowledge of
Him, and may live with you, having believed in Him.</p>
<p>Nicanora having thus spoken, the Apostle Philip, along with Bartholomew and Mariamme
and those with them, prayed for her to God, saying: Thou who bringest the dead to
life, Christ Jesus the Lord, who hast freed us through baptism from the slavery of death,2166
completely deliver also this woman from the error, the enemy; make her alive in Thy life,
and perfect her in Thy perfection, in order that she may be found in the country of her
fathers in freedom, having a portion in Thy goodness, O Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>And all having sent up the amen along with the Apostle Philip, behold, there came the
tyrant, the husband of Nicanora, raging like an unbroken horse; and having laid hold of his
wife’s garments, he cried out, saying: O Nicanora, did not I leave thee in bed? how hadst
thou so much strength as to come to these magicians? And how hast thou been cured of
the inflammation of thine eyes? Now, therefore, unless thou tell me who thy physician is,
and what is his name, I shall punish thee with various punishments, and shall not have
compassion upon thee. And she answering, says to him: O tyrant, cast out from thee this
tyranny of thine, forsake this wickedness of thine; abandon this life lasting only for a season;
run away from the brutality of thy worthless disposition; flee from the wicked dragon and
his lusts; throw from thee the works and the dart of the man-slaying serpent; renounce the
abominable and wicked sacrifices of the idols, which are the husbandry of the enemy, the
hedge of darkness; make for thyself a life chaste and pure, that being in holiness thou mayst
be able to know my Physician, and to get His name. If therefore thou wishest me to be beside
thee, prepare thyself to live in chastity and self-restraint, and in fear of the true God, and I
shall live with thee all my life; only cleanse thyself from the idols, and from all their filth.</p>

<p>And when the gloomy tyrant her husband heard these words of hers, he seized her by
the hair of her head, and dragged her along, kicking her, and saying: It will be a fine thing
for thee to be cut off by the sword, or to see thee from beside me committing fornication
with these foreign magicians; for I see that thou hast fallen into the madness of these deceivers.
Thee first of them, therefore, I shall cut off by an evil death; and then, not sparing them,
I shall cut their sinews, and put them to a most cruel death. And having turned, he said to
those about him: Bring out for me those impostors of magicians. And the public executioners
having run into the house of Stachys, and laid hold of the Apostle Philip, and Bartholomew
and Mariamme, dragged them along, leading them to where the proconsul was. And the
most faithful Stachys followed, and all the faithful.</p>
<p>And the proconsul seeing them, gnashed his teeth, saying: Torture these deceivers that
have deceived many women, and young men and girls, saying that they are worshippers of
God, while they are an abomination. And he ordered thongs of raw hide to be brought, and
Philip and Bartholomew and Mariamme to be beaten; and after they had been scourged
with the thongs, he ordered their feet to be tied, and them to be dragged through the streets
of the city as far as the gate of their temple. And a great crowd was assembled, so that scarcely
any one stayed at home; and they all wondered at their patience, as they were being violently
and inhumanly dragged along.</p>
<p>And the proconsul, having tortured the Apostle Philip and the saints who were with
him, ordered them to be brought, and secured in the temple of the idol of the viper by its
priests, until he should decide by what death he should destroy each of them. And many
of the crowd believed in the grace of Christ, and were added to the Apostle Philip, and those
with him, having renounced the idol of the viper, and were confirmed in the faith, being
magnified by the endurance of the saints; and all together with their voice glorified God,
saying the amen.</p>
<p>And when they were shut up in the temple of the viper—both Philip the Apostle, and
Bartholomew and Mariamme—the priests of the viper assembled in the same place, and a
great crowd, about seven thousand men; and having run to the proconsul, they cried out,
saying: Avenge us of the foreigners, and magicians, and corrupters and seducers of men.
For ever since they came to us, our city has been filled with every evil deed; and they have
also killed the serpents, the sons of our goddess; and they have also shut the temple, and the
altar has been desolated; and we have not found the wine which had been brought in order
that the viper, having drunk of it, might go to sleep. But if thou wishest to know that they
are really magicians, look and see how they wish to bewitch us, saying, Live in chastity and
piety, after believing in God; and how also they have come into the city; and how also the
dragons have not struck them blind, or even killed them; and how also they have not drunk
their blood; but even they who keep our city from every foreigner have been cast down by
these men.</p>

<pb n="1545"/>
<p>And the proconsul, having heard these things, was the more inflamed with rage, and
filled with wrath and threatening; and he was exceedingly enraged, and said to the priests:
Why need you speak, when they have bewitched my own wife? And from that time she has
spoken to me with strange words; and praying all the night through, she speaks in a strange
tongue with a light shining round her; and groaning aloud, she says, Jesus the true light has
come to me. And I, having gone forth from my chamber, wished to look down through the
window and see Jesus, the light which she spoke of; and like lightning it came upon me, so
that I was within a little of being blinded; and from that time forth I am afraid of my wife,
on account of her luminous Jesus. Tell me, ye priests, what I am to do. And they said to
him: O proconsul, assuredly we are no longer priests; for ever since thou didst shut them
up, in consequence of them praying, not only has the temple been shaken from the foundations,
but it is also assuredly falling down.</p>
<p>Then the proconsul ordered to bring Philip and those with him forth out of the temple,
and to bring them up to the tribunal, saying to the public executioner: Strip Philip and
Bartholomew and Mariamme, and search thoroughly to try to find their enchantments.
Having therefore first stripped Philip, then Bartholomew, they came also to Mariamme;
and dragging her along, they said: Let us strip her naked, that all may see her, how she follows
men; for she especially deceives all the women. And the tyrant says to the priests: Proclaim
throughout the whole city round about that all should come, men and women, that they
may see her indecency, that she travels about with these magicians, and no doubt commits
adultery with them. And he ordered Philip to be hanged, and his ankles to be pierced, and
to bring also iron hooks, and his heels also to be driven through, and to be hanged head
downwards, opposite the temple on a certain tree; and stretch out Bartholomew opposite
Philip, having nailed his hands on the wall of the gate of the temple.</p>
<p>And both of them smiled, seeing each other, both Philip and Bartholomew; for they
were as if they were not tortured: for their punishments were prizes and crowns. And when
also they had stripped Mariamme, behold, straightway the semblance of her body was
changed in the presence of all, and straightway there was about her a cloud of fire before
all; and they could not longer look at all on the place in which the holy Mariamme was, but
they all fled from her.</p>
<p>And Philip spoke with Bartholomew in the Hebrew tongue saying: Where is our
brother John? for, behold, I am being released from the body; and who is he that has prayed
for us? Because they have also laid hands on our sister Mariamme, contrary to what is meet;
and, behold, they have set fire to the house of Stachys, saying, Let us burn it, since he entertained
them. Dost thou wish then, Bartholomew, fire to come from heaven, and that we
should burn them up?</p>
<p>And as Philip was thus speaking, behold, also John entered into the city like one of their
fellow-citizens; and moving about in the street, he asked: Who are these men, and why are

<pb n="1546"/>
they punished? And they say to him: It cannot be that thou art of our city, and askest about
these men, who have wronged many: for they have shut up our gods, and by their magic
have cut off both the serpents and the dragons; and they have also raised many of the dead,
who have struck us with amazement, detailing many punishments against us, and they wish
also, these strangers who are hanging, to pray for fire out of heaven, and to burn up us and
our city.</p>
<p>Then says John: Let us go, and do you show me them. They led John, therefore, as their
fellow-citizen, to where Philip was; and there was there a great crowd, and the proconsul,
and the priests. And Philip, seeing John, said to Bartholomew in Hebrew: Brother, John
has come, who was in Barek, where the living water is.2167 And John saw Philip hanging
head downwards both by the ankles and the heels;2168 and he also saw Bartholomew stretched
out on the wall of the temple; and he said to them: The mystery of him that was hanged
between the heaven and the earth shall be with you.</p>
<p>And he said also to the men of that city: Ye men who dwell in Ophioryma Hierapolis,
great is the ignorance which is among you, for you have erred in the path of error. The
dragon breathing has breathed upon you, and blinded you in three ways; that is, he has
made you blind in body, and blind in soul, and blind in spirit: and you have been struck
by the destroyer. Look upon the whole creation, whether in the earth, or in the heaven, or
in the waters, that the serpent has no resemblance to anything above;2169 but he is of the
stock of corruption, and has been brought to nothing by God; and on this account he is
twisted and crooked, and there is no life in him; and anger, and rage, and darkness, and fire,
and smoke are in all his members. And now, therefore, why do you punish these men because
they have told you that the serpent is your enemy?</p>
<p>And when they heard these words from John, they raised their hands against him, saying:
We thought thee to be a fellow-citizen, but now thou hast shown thyself that thou art their
companion. Like them, so also thou shalt be put to death; for the priests have intended to
squeeze out your blood, and having mixed it with wine, to bring it to the viper to drink it.
When, therefore, the priests attempted to lay hold of John, their hands were paralyzed. And
John said to Philip: Let us not at all render evil for evil. And Philip said to John: Behold
now, where is my Lord Jesus, who told me not to avenge myself? But for my part, I shall
not endure it longer; but I will accomplish upon them my threat, and will destroy them
all2170.</p>

<p>And John and Bartholomew and Mariamme restrained him, saying: Our Master was
beaten, was scourged, was extended on the cross, was made to drink gall and vinegar, and
said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.2171 And this He taught, saying:
Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.2172 Let us also therefore be patient. Philip
says: Go away, and do not mollify me; for I will not bear that they have hanged me head
down, and pierced my ankles and my heels with irons. And thou, John, beloved of God,
how much hast thou reasoned with them, and thou hast not been listened to! Wherefore
go away from me, and I will curse them, and they shall be destroyed utterly to a man. And
he began to curse them, invoking, and crying out in Hebrew: Abalo, aremun, iduthael,
tharseleon, nachoth, aidunaph, teletoloi:2173 that is, O Father of Christ, the only and
Almighty God; O God, whom all ages dread, powerful and impartial Judge, whose name is
in Thy dynasty Sabaoth,2174 blessed art Thou for everlasting: before Thee tremble dominions
and powers of the celestials, and the fire-breathing threats of the cherubic living ones; the
King, holy in majesty, whose name came upon the wild beasts of the desert, and they were
tamed, and praised Thee with a rational voice; who lookest upon us, and readily grantest
our requests; who knewest us before we were fashioned; the Overseer of all: now, I pray,
let the great Hades open its mouth; let the great abyss swallow up these the ungodly, who
have not been willing to receive the word of truth in this city. So let it be, Sabaoth. And,
behold, suddenly the abyss was opened, and the whole of the place in which the proconsul
was sitting was swallowed up, and the whole of the temple, and the viper which they worshipped,
and great crowds, and the priests of the viper, about seven thousand men, besides
women and children, except where the apostles were: they remained unshaken. And the
proconsul was swallowed up into the abyss; and their voices came up from beneath, saying,
with weeping: Have mercy upon us, O God of Thy glorious apostles, because we now see
the judgments of those who have not confessed the crucified One: behold, the cross illumines
us. O Jesus Christ, manifest Thyself to us, because we are all coming down alive into Hades,
and are being scourged because we have unjustly crucified Thine apostles. And a voice was
heard of one, saying: I shall be merciful to you in the cross of light.</p>

<p>And there remained both Stachys and all his house, and the wife of the proconsul, and
fifty other women who had believed with her upon the Lord, and a multitude besides, both
of men and women, and a hundred virgins who had not been swallowed up because of their
chastity, having been sealed with the seal of Christ.</p>
<p>Then the Lord, having appeared unto Philip, said: O Philip, didst thou not hear: Thou
shalt not render evil for evil? and why hast thou inflicted such destruction? O Philip, whosoever
putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backwards,2175 is his furrow well set? or
who gives up his own lamp to another, and himself sits in darkness? or who forsakes his
own dwelling-place, and dwells on a dunghill himself? And who, giving away his own garment
in winter, goes naked? or what enemy rejoices in the joy of the man that hates him?
and what soldier goes to war without a full suit of armour? and what slave who has fulfilled
his master’s order will not be commended? and who in the race-course, having nobly run,
does not receive the prize? and who that has washed his garments willingly defiles them?
Behold, my bride chamber is ready; but blessed is he who has been found in it wearing the
shining garment:2176 he it is who receives the crown upon his head. Behold, the supper is
ready; and blessed is he who is invited, and is ready to go to Him that has invited him. The
harvest of the field is much,2177 and blessed is the good labourer. Behold the lilies and all
the flowers, and it is the good husbandman who is the first to get a share of them. And how
hast thou become, O Philip, unmerciful, having cursed thine enemies in wrath?</p>
<p>Philip says: Why art Thou angry with me, Lord, because I have cursed mine enemies?
for why dost Thou not tread them under foot, because they are yet alive in the abyss? And
knowest Thou, Lord, that because of Thee I came into this city, and in Thy name I have
persecuted all the error of the idols, and all the demons? The dragons have withered away,
and the serpents. And since these men have not received Thy light, therefore have I cursed
them, and they have gone down to Hades alive.</p>
<p>And the Saviour says to Philip: But since thou hast disobeyed me, and hast requited
evil for evil, and hast not kept my commandment, on this account thou shalt finish thy
course gloriously indeed, and shalt be led by the hand by my holy angels, and shalt come
with them even to the paradise of delight; and they indeed shall come beside me into paradise,
but thee will I order to be shut outside of paradise for forty days, in terror under the flaming
and turning sword, and thou shalt groan because thou hast done evil to those who have
done evil to thee. And after forty days I shall send my archangel Michael; and he, having
taken hold of the sword guarding paradise, shall bring thee into it, and thou shalt see all the
righteous who have walked in their innocence, and then thou shalt worship the glory of my

Father in the heavens. Nevertheless the sign of thy departure shall be glorified in my cross.
And Bartholomew having gone away into Lycaonia, shall there also be himself crucified;
and Mariamme shall lay her body in the river Jordan. But I, O Philip, will not endure thee,
because thou hast swallowed up the men into the abyss; but, behold, my Spirit is in them,
and I shall bring them up from the dead; and thus they, seeing thee, shall believe in the glory
of Him that sent thee.</p>
<p>And the Saviour having turned, stretched up His hand, and marked a cross in the air
coming down from above even to the abyss, and it was full of light, and had its form after
the likeness of a ladder. And all the multitude that had gone down from the city into the
abyss came up on the ladder of the luminous cross; but there remained below the proconsul,
and the viper which they worshipped. And when the multitude had come up, having looked
upon Philip hanging head downwards, they lamented with a great lamentation at the lawless
action which they had done. And they also saw Bartholomew, and Mariamme having her
former appearance. And, behold, the Lord went up into the heavens in the sight of Philip,
and Bartholomew and Mariamme, and Stachys, and all the unbelieving people, and silently
they glorified God in fear and trembling. And all the multitudes cried out, saying: He alone
is God, whom these men proclaim in truth; He alone is God, who sent these men for our
salvation. Let us therefore truly repent for our great error, because we are by no means
worthy of everlasting life. Now we believe, because we have seen great wonders, because
the Saviour has brought us up from the abyss. And they all fell upon their face, and adored
Philip, and entreated him, ready to flee: Do not do another miracle, and again send us away
into the abyss. And they prayed that they might become worthy of the appearing of Christ.
And Philip, yet hanging, addressed them, and said: Hear and learn how great are the
powers of my God, remembering what you have seen below, and how your city has been
overturned, with the exception of the house which received me; and now the sweetness of
my God has brought you up out of the abyss, and I am obliged to walk round paradise for
forty days on your account, because I was enraged against you into requiting you. And this
commandment alone I have not kept, in that I did not give you good in return for evil. But
I say unto you, From this time forth, in the goodness of God, reject the evil, that you may
become worthy of the thanksgiving2178 of the Lord.</p>
<p>And some of the faithful ran up to take down Philip, and take off him the iron grapnels,
and the hooks out of his ankles. But Philip said: Do not, my children, do not come near
me on account of this, for thus shall be my end. Listen to me, ye who have been enlightened
in the Lord, that I came to this city, not to make any merchandise, or do any other thing;
but I have been destined to go out of my body in this city in the case in which you see me.
Grieve not, then, that I am hanging thus; for I bear the stamp2179 of the first man, who was

brought to the earth head downwards, and again, through the wood of the cross brought to
life out of the death of the transgression. And now I accomplish that which hath been enjoined
upon me; for the Lord said to me, Unless you shall make that of you which is down
to be up, and that which is on the left to be on the right, you shall not enter into my kingdom.
Be ye not therefore likened to the unchanged type, for all the world has been changed, and
every soul dwelling in a body is in forgetfulness of heavenly things; but let not us possessing
the glory of the heavenly seek that which is without, which is the body and the house of
slavery. Be not unbelieving, but believing, and forgive each other’s faults. Behold, I hang
six days, and I have blame from the true Judge, because I altogether requited you evil, and
put a stumbling-block in the way of my rectitude. And now I am going up on high; be not
sorrowful, but rather rejoice, because I am leaving this dwelling-place, my body, having escaped
from the corruption of the dragon, who punishes every soul that is in sins.</p>
<p>And Philip, having looked round upon the multitudes, said: O ye who have come up
out of the dead from Hades, and the swallowing up of the abyss,—and the luminous cross
led you up on high, through the goodness of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost,—He being God became man, having been made flesh out of the Virgin Mary, immortal,
abiding in flesh; and having died, He raised the dead, having had pity on mankind,
having taken away the sting of sin. He was great, and became small for our sake, until He
should enlarge the small, and bring them into His greatness. And He it is who has sweetness;
and they spat upon Him, giving Him gall to drink, in order that He might make those who
were bitter against Him to taste of His sweetness. Cleave then to Him, and do not forsake
Him, for He is our life to everlasting.</p>
<p>And when Philip had finished this announcement, he says to them, Loose Bartholomew;
and having gone up, they loosed him. And after loosing him, Philip says to him: Bartholomew,
my brother in the Lord, thou knowest that the Lord has sent thee with me to this
city, and thou hast shared with me in all the dangers with our sister Mariamme; but I know
that the going forth from thy body has been appointed in Lycaonia, and it has been decreed
to Mariamme to go forth from the body in the river Jordan. Now therefore I command
you, that when I have gone forth from my body, you shall build a church in this place; and
let the leopard and the kid of the goats2180 come into the church, for a sign to those that
believe; and let Nicanora provide for them until they shall go forth from the body; and when
they shall have gone forth, bury them by the gate of the church. And lay your peace upon
the house of Stachys, as Christ laid His peace on this city. And let all the virgins who believe
stand in that house each day, watching over the sick, walking two and two; but let them
have no communication with young men, that Satan may not tempt them:2181 for he is a

creeping serpent, and he caused Adam by means of Eve to slip into death. Let it not be so
again in this time as in the case of Eve. But do thou, O Bartholomew, look to them well:2182
and thou shalt give these injunctions to Stachys, and appoint him bishop. Do not entrust
the place of the bishopric to a young man, that the Gospel of Christ may not be brought to
shame; and let every one that teacheth have his works equal to his words. But I am going
to the Lord, and take my body and prepare it for burial with Syriac sheets of paper; and do
not put round me flaxen cloth, because the body of my Lord was wrapped in linen. And
having prepared my body for burial in the sheets of paper, bind it tight with papyrus reeds,
and bury it in the church; and pray for me2183 forty days, in order that the Lord may forgive
me the transgression wherein I transgressed, in requiting those who did evil to me. See, O
Bartholomew, where my blood shall drop upon the earth, a plant shall spring up from my
blood, and shall become a vine, and shall produce fruit of a bunch of grapes; and having
taken the cluster, press it into the cup; and having partaken of it on the third day, send up
on high the Amen, in order that the offering may be complete.</p>
<p>And Philip, having said these things, prayed thus: O Lord Jesus Christ, Father of the
ages, King of the light, who hast made us wise in Thy wisdom, and hast given us Thine un-
derstanding, and hast bestowed upon us the counsel of Thy goodness, who hast never at
any time left us, Thou art He who taketh away the disease of those who flee to Thee for
refuge; Thou art the Son of the living God, who hast given us Thy presence of wisdom, who
hast given us signs and wonders, and hast turned those who have gone astray; who crownest
those who overcome the adversary, Thou excellent Judge.2184 Come now, Jesus, and give
me the everlasting crown of victory against every adverse dominion and power, and do not
let their dark air hide me when I shall cross the waters of fire and all the abyss. O my Lord
Jesus Christ, let not the enemy have ground to accuse me at Thy tribunal: but put on me
Thy glorious robe, Thy seal of light that ever shines, until I shall pass by all the powers of
the world, and the wicked dragon that lieth in wait for us. Now therefore, my Lord Jesus
Christ, make me to meet Thee in the air, having forgiven me the recompense which I recompensed
to my enemies; and transform the form of my body into angelic glory, and give me
rest in Thy blessedness; and let me receive the promise from Thee which Thou hast promised

<p>And having thus spoken, Philip gave up the ghost, while all the multitudes were looking
upon him, and weeping, and saying: The life of this spirit has been accomplished in peace.

<p>And Bartholomew and Mariamme took down his body, and did as Philip had commanded
them, and buried it in that place. And there was straightway a voice out of the
heavens: Philip the apostle has been crowned with an incorruptible crown by Jesus Christ,
the Judge of the contest. And all shouted out the Amen.</p>
<p>And after the three days the plant of the vine sprouted up where the blood of the holy
Philip had dropped. And they did all that had been commanded them by him, offering an
offering for forty days, praying without ceasing. And they built the church in that place,
having appointed Stachys bishop in the church. And Nicanora and all the faithful assembled,
and did not cease, all of them, glorifying God on account of the wonders that had happened
among them. And all the city believed in the name of Jesus. And Bartholomew commanded
Stachys to baptize those who believed into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>And after the forty days, the Saviour, having appeared in the form of Philip, said to
Bartholomew and Mariamme: My beloved brethren, do you wish to rest in the rest of God?
Paradise has been opened to me, and I have entered into the glory of Jesus. Go away to the
place appointed for you; for the plant that has been set apart and planted in this city shall
bear excellent fruit. Having therefore saluted the brethren, and prayed for each of them,
they departed from the city of Ophioryma, the Hierapolis of Asia; and Bartholomew departed

<head>Acts of Saint Philip the Apostle When He Went to Upper Hellas.</head>
<p>And it came to pass in those days, when Philip entered into the city of Athens called
Hellas, there assembled to him three hundred philosophers, saying: Let us go and see what
his wisdom is; for they say about the wise men of Asia, that their wisdom is great. For they
thought that Philip was a philosopher, since he was travelling in the dress of a recluse; and
they did not know that he was an apostle of Christ. For the dress which Jesus gave to His
disciples was a mantle only, and a linen cloth.2185 Thus, then, Philip was going about. On
this account, therefore, when the philosophers of Hellas saw him, they were afraid. They
assembled therefore into one place, and said to each other: Come, let us look into our books,
lest somehow this stranger overcome us, and put us to shame.</p>
<p>And having done so, they came together to the same place, and say to Philip: We have
doctrines of our fathers in which we are pleased, seeking after knowledge; but if thou hast
anything new, O stranger, show it to us without envy boldly: for we have need of nothing
else, but only to hear something new.2186</p>
<p>And Philip answering, said to them: O philosophers of Hellas, if you wish to hear some
new thing, and are desirous of something new, you ought to throw away from you the disposition
of the old man; as my Lord said, It is impossible to put new wine into old bottles,
since the bottle is burst, and the wine spilled, and the bottle destroyed.2187 But they put
new wine into fresh bottles, so that both may be preserved. And these things the Lord said
in parables, teaching us in His holy wisdom, that many will love the new wine, not having
a bottle fresh and new. And I love you, O men of Hellas, and I congratulate you for having
said, We love something new. For instruction really new and fresh my Lord has brought
into the world, in order that He might sweep away all worldly instruction.</p>
<p>The philosophers say: Who is it that thou callest thy Lord? Philip says: My Lord is Jesus
in heaven. And they said to him: Show him to our comprehension without envy, that we
also may believe in him. And Philip said: He with whom I am about to make you acquainted
as Lord, is above every name; there is no other.2188 And this only I say: As you have said,
Do not refuse us through envy, let it not be that I should refuse you; but rather in great exultation
and in great joy I have to reveal to you that name, for I have no other work in this
world than this proclamation.2189 For when my Lord came into this world, He chose us,
being twelve in number, having filled us with the Holy Spirit; from His light He made us

know who He was, and commanded us to preach all salvation through Him, because there
is no other name named out of heaven than this.2190 On this account I have come to you,
to make you fully assured, not in word only, but also in the showing forth of wonderful
works in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And when the philosophers heard this, they say to Philip: This name that has been
heard of by us from thee we have never found in the books of our fathers; now, therefore,
how can we know about thy words? And moreover, in addition, they say to him: Allow us
three days, that we may consult with each other about this name; for we lay no little stress
upon this—to apostatize from our fathers’ religion. Philip therefore says to them: Consult
as you wish; for there is no deceit in the matter.</p>
<p>And the three hundred philosophers having assembled, spoke with each other, saying:
You know that this man has brought a strange philosophy, and the words spoken by him
bring us to distraction. What, then, shall we do about him, or about the name of him who
is called Jesus, the king of the ages, whom he speaks of? And moreover they say to each
other: Assuredly we cannot reason with him, but the high priest of the Jews can. If therefore
it seem good, let us send to him, in order that he may stand up to this stranger, and that we
may learn accurately the name that is preached.</p>
<p>They wrote therefore to Jerusalem after this manner:—The philosophers of Hellas to
Ananias, the great high priest of the Jews in Jerusalem. There being between thee and us at
all times great2191…as thou knowest that we Athenians are searchers after truth. A certain
foreigner has come to Hellas, Philip by name; and, in a word, he has disturbed us exceedingly,
both by words and by extraordinary miracles, and he introduces a glorious name, Jesus,
professing himself to be his disciple. And he does also wonders of which we write to you,
in that he has cast out demons that have been long in men, and makes the deaf hear, the
blind see; and what is more wonderful—which also we should have first mentioned—he
has raised up men after they were dead, that have fairly completed the number of their
days.2192 And the fame of him has gone abroad into all Hellas and Macedonia; and there
are many coming to him from the cities round about, bringing those who are ill with various
diseases, and he heals them all through the name of Jesus. On this account, therefore, come
to us without any reluctance, that thou thyself mayst announce to us what Jesus, this name
which he teaches, means. For on this account also we have sent this letter to thee, O high
priest.</p>
<p>And when he had read, he was filled with great wrath, and rent his clothes, and said:
Has that deceiver gone even to Athens, among the philosophers, to lead them astray? And

the Mansemat—that is, Satan—entered into Ananias unawares, and filled him with anger
and rage; and he said: If I allow that Philip himself, and those with him, to live, the law will
be entirely destroyed, and their teaching will likely fill the whole earth. And the high priest
went into his own house, and the teachers of the law, and the Pharisees; and they consulted
with each other, saying: What shall we do about these things?2193 And they say to the high
priest Ananias: Stand up and arm thyself, and five hundred able men out of the people, and
go away to Athens, and by all means kill Philip, and thus thou shalt overturn his teaching.</p>
<p>And having put on the high priest’s robe, he came to Hellas in great pomp, with the five
hundred men. And Philip was in the house of a certain chief man of the city, with the
brethren who had believed. And the high priest and those with him, and the three hundred
philosophers, went up to the gateway of the house where Philip was; and it was told Philip
that they were outside. And he rose up and went out. And when the high priest saw him,
he says to him: O Philip, sorcerer and magician, for I know thee, that in Jerusalem thy
master the deceiver called thee Son of Thunder.2194 Was not the whole of Judæa sufficient
for you, but you have come here also to deceive men who are searchers after wisdom? And
Philip said: Would that, O Ananias, thy covering of unbelief were taken away from thy
heart, that thou mightst know my words, and from them learn whether I am a deceiver, or
thou!</p>
<p>Ananias having heard this, said to Philip: I shall give answer to all. And Philip said:
Speak. The high priest says: O men of Hellas, this Philip believes in a man called Jesus, who
was born among us, who also taught this heresy, and destroyed the law and the temple, and
brought to nought the purification through Moses, and the new moons, because he says,
These have not been commanded by God. And when we saw that he thus destroyed the
law, we stood up against him, and crucified him, that his teaching might not be fulfilled.
For many changes were brought in by him; and he gave an evil testimony, for he ate all
things in common, and mixed with blood, after the manner of the Gentiles.2195 And having
given him up, we put him to death, and buried him in a tomb; and these disciples of his
having stolen him, have proclaimed everywhere that he has risen from the dead, and have
led astray a great multitude by professing that he is at the right hand of God in heaven.2196
But now these men, themselves having the circumcision as we also have, have not followed
it, since they began to do many deeds of power in Jerusalem through the name of Jesus; and
having been cast out of Jerusalem, they go about the world, and deceive all men by the magic
of that Jesus, as also now this Philip has come to you to deceive you by the same means.</p>

<p>But I shall carry him away with myself to Jerusalem, because Archelaus the king is also
searching for him to kill him.</p>
<p>And when the multitude standing round heard this, those indeed who had been confirmed
in the faith were not shaken nor made to waver; for they knew that Philip would
conquer in the glory of Jesus. Philip therefore stated his case in the power of Christ with
great boldness, exulting and saying: I, O men of Athens, and those of you who are philosophers,
have come to you, not to teach you with words, but by the showing forth of miracles;
and in part you have quickly seen2197 the things that have come to pass through me, in that
name by which the high priest himself is cast off.2198 For, behold, I shall cry to my God,
and teach you, and you will prove the words of both.</p>
<p>The high priest having heard this, ran to Philip, wishing to scourge him, and that same
hour his whole hand was dried up, and his eyes were blinded; and in like manner also the
five hundred who were with him were also themselves blinded. And they reviled and cursed
the high priest, saying: Coming out of Jerusalem we said to thee, Refrain; for, being men,
we cannot fight against God.2199 But we entreat thee, O Philip, apostle of the God Jesus,
give us the light that is through him, that we also may truly be his slaves.</p>
<p>And Philip, having seen what had come to pass, said: O weak nature! which has thrown
itself upon us, but straightway has been brought down low into itself; O bitter sea! which
rouses its waves against us, and thinks to cast us out, but which by itself lulls its waves to
rest. Now therefore, O our good steward Jesus, the holy light, Thou hast not overlooked us
who are all together crying up to Thee in all good works, but hast come to finish them
through us. Now therefore come, Lord Jesus; reprove the folly of these men.</p>
<p>The high priest says to Philip: Dost thou then think to turn us away from the traditions
of our fathers, and the God of the desert, and Moses; and dost thou imagine that thou wilt
make us followers of Jesus the Nazarene? Then Philip says to him: Behold, I shall pray to
my God to come and manifest Himself before thee and the five hundred, and before all here;
for perhaps thou wilt change thy mind, and believe. But if even to the end thou remain in
unbelief, there is coming upon thee an extraordinary thing, which shall be spoken of to
generations of generations—that also thou shalt go down alive, down into Hades, before
the face of all seeing thee, because thou yet abidest in unbelief, because also thou seekest to
turn away this multitude from the true life. And Philip prayed, saying: O holy Father of
the holy Son Jesus Christ, who hast granted to me to believe in Him, send Thy beloved Son
Jesus Christ to reprove the unbelieving high priest, that Thy name may be glorified in Christ
the Beloved.</p>

<pb n="1557"/>
<p>And while Philip was yet crying out this, suddenly the heavens were opened, and Jesus
appeared coming down in most excellent glory, and in lightning; and His face was shining
sevenfold more than the sun, and His garments were whiter than snow, so that also all the
idols of Athens fell suddenly to the ground. And the people fled in anguish; and the demons
dwelling among them cried out: Behold, we also flee because of Him who has appeared to
the city, Jesus the Son of God. Then Philip says to the high priest: Hearest thou the demons
crying out because of Him who has been seen, and believest thou not in Him who is present
that He is Lord of all? The high priest says: I have no other God than the one in the desert.
And as Jesus was going up into heaven there happened a very great earthquake, so that
the place on which they stood was cleft; and the crowds ran and fell at the feet of the apostle,
crying out: Have mercy upon us, O man of God! In like manner also the five hundred men
cried out themselves also again: Have mercy upon us, O Philip, that we may know thee,
and through thee Jesus the light of life: for we said to this unbelieving high priest, Being
sinful men, we cannot fight against God.</p>
<p>Then Philip says: There is no hatred in us, but the grace of Christ will make you receive
your sight; but I will make the high priest receive his sight before you, that at this you may
the more believe. And a voice out of heaven was brought to Philip: O Philip, son once of
thunder, but now of meekness, whatever thou mayst ask of my Father, He shall do for thee.
And all the crowd was terror-struck at the voice, for the sound of it was greater than that
of thunder. Then Philip says to the high priest: In the name of the power of the voice of
my Lord, receive thy sight, Ananias. And immediately he received his sight, and looked
round, and said: What is there in the magic of Jesus, that this Philip within a short time has
made me blind, and again within a short time has made me receive my sight? Dost thou
then, said Philip, believe in Jesus? The high priest says: You do not think, do you, that you
can bewitch me, and persuade me? And the five hundred who were with him, having heard
that their high priest, having received his sight, was yet unbelieving, said to the bystanders
to pray Philip that he should make them receive their sight, that, said they, we may cut off
this unbelieving high priest.</p>
<p>And Philip said: Do not avenge yourselves upon the wicked. And he says to the high
priest: There will be a certain great sign upon thee. He says to Philip: I know that thou art
a sorcerer and a disciple of Jesus: thou dost not bewitch me. And the apostle said to Jesus:
Sabarthan, sabathabt, bramanuch, come quickly. And immediately the earth was cleft in
the place where Ananias was, and swallowed him up as far as the knees. And Ananias cried
out: O great is the power of the true witchcraft, because it has cleft the earth, when Philip
threatened it in Hebrew, and adjured it; and it holds me even to the knees, and by the heels
some hooks as it were drag me downwards, that I may believe in Philip; but he cannot persuade
me, for from Jerusalem I know his magic tricks.</p>

<pb n="1558"/>
<p>And Philip, enraged, said: O earth, lay fast hold of him, even to the navel. And immediately
it dragged him down. And he said: The one of my feet underneath is turned into
ice, and the other is frightfully hot; but by thy magic, Philip, I will not be overcome. Except,
therefore, that I am sore tortured underneath, I do not believe at all. And the crowds wished
to stone him. And Philip says: Not so; for this has in the meantime happened, that he has
been swallowed up as far as the navel, that the salvation of your souls may be effected, because
he would almost have drawn you by his wicked words into unbelief. But if even he repented,
I should bring him up out of the earth to the salvation of his soul; but assuredly he is not
worthy of salvation. If, then, he remain in unbelief, you shall see him sunk down into the
abyss, unless the Lord intends to raise those who are in Hades, that they may confess that
Jesus is Lord. For in that day every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord,2200 and that there
is one glory of the Father, and the Son, with the Holy Spirit for evermore.</p>
<p>And Philip, having said this, extended his right hand, stretching it through the air over
the five hundred men in the name of Jesus. And their eyes were opened, and they all praised
God with one mouth, saying: We bless Thee, O Christ Jesus, the God of Philip, that thou
hast driven the blindness away from us, and hast given us Thy light, the Gospel. And Philip
rejoiced exceedingly at their words, because they were thus confirmed in the faith. And
after this, Philip, having turned to the high priest, said: Confess thou also in a pure heart
that Jesus is Lord, that thou mayst be saved, like those with thee. But the high priest laughed
at Philip, and remained in unbelief.</p>
<p>Philip then, seeing that he remained in unbelief, having looked at him, says to the earth:
Open thy mouth, and swallow him up as far as his neck in the presence of those who have
believed in Christ Jesus. And in the same hour the earth, having opened its mouth, received
him as far as the neck. And the multitude communed with each other on account of the
wonders that had happened.</p>
<p>A certain chief man of the city came crying out, and saying: O blessed apostle, a certain
demon has assailed my son, and cried out, saying to me, Since thou hast allowed a foreigner
to come into your city, thou who hast been the first to do away with2201 our worship and
our sacrifices, what shall I do for thee, except to kill this thine only begotten son? And after
he said this, he strangled my son. Now therefore, I beseech thee, O apostle of Christ, do not
allow my joy to be turned into sorrow, because I also have believed thy words.</p>
<p>And the apostle, having heard this, said: I wonder at the activity of the demons, that it
is active in every place, and dares to assail those to whose help I have not been able to
come,2202 as now they have tried you, wishing to cause you to offend. And he says to the
<note type="footnote">2200 Phil. ii. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">2201 Or, thou being a chief man who has done away with.</note>

<pb n="1559"/>
man: Bring me thy son, and I will give him to thee alive, through my Christ. And rejoicing,
he ran to bring his son. And when he came near his house, he cried out, saying: My son, I
have come to thee to carry thee to the apostle, so that he may present thee to me living.
And he ordered his slaves to carry the bed; and his son was twenty-three years old. And
when Philip saw him, he was moved; and he turned to the high priest, and said: This has
happened as a chance for thee: if, therefore, I shall raise him up, wilt thou henceforth believe?
And he says: I know your magic arts, that thou wilt raise him up; but I will not believe thee.
And Philip, enraged, said: A curse upon thee! then go down altogether into the abyss before
the face of all these. And at the same hour he went down into Hades alive, except that the
high priest’s robe flew off from him; and because of this, from that day, no one knew what
became of the priest’s robe. And the apostle turned round and prayed for the boy; and
having driven the demon away from him, he raised him up, and set him beside his father
alive.</p>
<p>And the multitude having beheld this, cried out: The God of Philip is the only God,
who has punished the unbelief of the high priest, and driven away the demon from the
young man, and raised him up from the dead. And the five hundred having seen the high
priest swallowed up into the abyss, and the other miracles, besought Philip, and he gave
them the seal in Christ. And Philip abode in Athens two years; and having founded a church,
appointed a bishop and a presbyter, and so went away to Parthia, preaching Christ. To
whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Addition to Acts of Philip.</head>
<p>(From a Paris ms.)2203</p>
<p>And he taught them thus: My brethren, sons of my Father—for you are of my family
as to Christ, substance of my city, the Jerusalem above, the delight of my dwelling-place—why
have you been taken captive by your enemy the serpent, twisted, crooked, and perverse, to
whom God has given neither hands nor feet? And crooked is his going, since he is the son
of the wicked one; for his father is death, and his mother corruption, and ruin is in his body.
Do not go then into his destruction; for you are in bondage by the unbelief and deception
of his son, who is without order, and has no substance;2204 formless, and has no form in
the whole creation, either in the heaven or in the earth, or among the fishes that are in the
waters. But if you see him, flee from him, since he has no resemblance to men: his dwelling
is the abyss, and he walks in darkness. Flee, then, from him, that his venom may not be
poured out upon you: if his venom be poured out upon your body, you walk in his
wickedness. But remain rather in the true worship, being faithful, reverent, and good,
without guile. Flee from Satan the dragon, and remove from you his wicked seed, namely
desire, by which he begets disease in the soul, which is the venom of the serpent. For desire
is of the serpent from the beginning, and she it is who arms herself against the faithful; for
she came forth out of the darkness, and returns to the darkness. You ought therefore, after
coming to us, or rather through us to God, to throw out the venom of the devil from your
bodies.</p>
<p>And as the apostle was saying this, behold, Nicanora came forth from her house, and
went with her slaves into the house of Stachys. And when she came near the door of the
house, behold, Mariamme spoke to her in the Syriac language: Helikomaei, kosma, etaa,
mariacha. And she explained her words, saying: O daughter of the Spirit, thou art my lady,
who hast been given in pledge to the serpent; but I have come to deliver thee: I shall break
thy bonds, and cut them from their root. Behold, the Deliverer that frees thee has come:
behold, the Sun of righteousness has risen to enlighten thee.</p>
<p>And when she was thus speaking, the gloomy tyrant came running and panting. And
Nicanora, who was before the door, heard this, and took courage before them all, crying
out and saying: I am a Hebrew, a daughter of the Hebrews; speak with me in the language
of my fathers, because I have heard your preaching, and have been cured of this my disease.

I reverence and glorify the goodness of God, in that He hath made you to be utterly spoiled
in this earth.</p>
<p>And when she said this, the tyrant came, and took hold of her garments, and said: O
Nicanora, did I not leave thee lying on the bed from thy disease? Whence, then, hast thou
found this power and strength, so as to be able to come to these magicians? Unless, then,
thou tell who is the healer, I shall punish thee most severely. And Nicanora answered, and
said: O rearer of tyrants, cast away from thyself this tyranny, and forget thy wicked works,
and abandon this temporary life, and put away vainglory, because it passes like a shadow:
seek rather what is everlasting, and take away from thyself the beastly and impious work of
base desire, and reject vain intercourse, which is the husbandry of death, the dark prison;
and overturn the middle wall of corruption, and prepare for thyself a life chaste and spotless,
that we may altogether live in sanctity. If, then, thou wishest me to remain with thee, I will
live with thee in continence.</p>
<p>And when the tyrant heard these words, he seized her by the hair of the head, and
dragged her along, kicking her, and saying: It would be better for thee to be put to death
by my sword, than to be seen with these foreign magicians and deceivers. I will punish thee,
therefore, and put to death those who have deceived thee. And he turned in a rage to the
executioners who followed him, and said: Bring me these impostors. And the executioners
ran to the house of Stachys, and laid hold of Philip, and Bartholomew, and Mariamme, with
the leopard and the kid of the goats, and dragged them along, and brought them.</p>
<p>When the tyrant saw them, he gnashed his teeth against them, and said: Drag along
these magicians and deceivers that have deceived many souls of women by saying, We are
worshippers of God. And he caused thongs to be brought, and bound their feet. And he
ordered them to be dragged along from the gate as far as the temple. And great multitudes
came together to that place. And they wondered exceedingly at the leopard and the kid; for
they were speaking like men, and some of the multitude believed the words of the apostles.</p>
<p>And the priests said to the tyrant: These men are magicians. And when he heard that,
he burned with rage, and was filled with anger; and he ordered Philip, and Bartholomew,
and Mariamne to be stripped, saying: Search them. Perhaps you will find their sorcery.
And the executioners stripped them, and laid hold of Mariamne, and dragged her along,
saying: Uncover her, that they may learn that it is a woman who follows them. And he
ordered to bring clubs and strong cords; and after piercing Philip’s ankles they brought
hooks, and put the cords through his ankles, and hung him head downwards on a tree that
was before the door of the temple; and they fixed pegs into the temple wall, and left him.
And after binding Bartholomew hand and foot, they extended him naked on the wall; and
when they had stripped Mariamne, the appearance of her body was changed, and became
a glass chest filled with light, and they could not come near her.</p>

<pb n="1562"/>
<p>And Philip spoke with Bartholomew in Hebrew: Where is John to-day, in the day of
our need? for behold, we are being delivered from our bodies. And they have laid hands
on Mariamne beyond what is seemly, and they have scourged the leopard and the kid of the
goats, and have set fire to the house of Stachys, because he took us in. Let us therefore speak,
that fire may come down from heaven and burn them up.</p>
<p>And as Philip was thus speaking, behold, John came into the city, and walked about the
street, and asked those in the city: What is the commotion, and who are these men, and
why are they punished? And they say to him: Art thou not of this city? And dost thou not
know about these men, how they disturbed our houses, and the whole city? Moreover, they
have even persuaded our wives to go away from us on the pretence of religion, proclaiming
a foreign name, viz. Christ’s; and they have also shut our temples by the sorcery they have,
and they have put to death the serpents that are in the city by foreign names that we have
never known. And they have fixed their abode in the house of Stachys the blind man, whom
they made to recover his sight through the spittle of a woman who accompanies them; and
it is perhaps she who has all the sorcery: and there accompany them a leopard and a kid,
speaking like men. But if ever you have seen such doings, you will not be put about by
them. And John answered, and said to them: Show me them. And they brought him to
the temple where Philip was hanging. And when Philip saw John, he said to Bartholomew:
O my brother, behold the son of Barega—that is the living water—has come. And John saw
Philip hanging head down, tied by his ankles; and saw Bartholomew also bound to the
temple wall.</p>
<p>And he said to the men of the city: O children of the serpent, how great is your folly!
for the way of deceit has deceived you, the wicked dragon breathing has breathed upon you:
why do you punish these men for saying the serpent is your enemy?</p>
<p>And when they heard these words from John, they laid their hands upon him, saying:
We called thee our fellow-citizen, but now thy speech has made thee manifest that thou also
art in communion with them. Thou also, therefore, shalt be put to the same death as they,
for the priests have decided thus: Let us drain out their blood as they hang head downward,
and mix it with wine, and offer it to the viper.</p>
<p>And when they were thus speaking, behold, Mariamne rose up from the place in which
she was, and came back to her former appearance.</p>
<p>And the priests reached forth their hands towards John, wishing to lay hold of him, and
they could not. Then Philip with Bartholomew said to John: Where is Jesus, who enjoins
upon us not to take into our own hands vengeance on those that torture us? for after this I
will not endure them. And Philip spoke in Hebrew, and said: My Father Uthael, i.e., O

<pb n="1563"/>
Christ, Father of majesty, whose name all the ages2205 fear, who art powerful, and the power
of the universe, whose name goes forth in lordship,2206 Eloa: Blessed art Thou to the ages;
Thou whom dominions and powers fear, trembling before Thy face; King of honour! Father
of majesty! whose name has gone forth to the wild beasts of the desert, and they have become
quiet because of Thee, and through Thee the serpents have departed from us: Hear us before
we ask. Thou who seest us before we call, who knowest our thoughts, the All-surveyor2207
of all, who sends forth from Himself unnumbered compassions; let the abyss open its mouth,
and swallow up these godless persons who will not accept the word of Thy truth.</p>
<p>And in that very hour the abyss opened its mouth, and all that place was violently shaken,
from the proconsul to all the multitude along with the priests; and they were all sunk down.
And the places where the apostles and all who were with them were remained unshaken,
and the house of Stachys, and Nicanora the tyrant’s wife, and the twenty-four wives who
fled from their husbands, and the forty virgins who had not known men. These alone did
not go down into the abyss, because they had become servants, and had received the word
of God, and His seal; but all the rest of the city were swallowed down into the abyss.</p>
<p>And the Saviour having appeared at that hour, said to Philip: Who is it that has put his
hand to the plough, and has turned back from making the furrow straight? or who gives his
light to others, and himself remains sitting in darkness? or who dwells in the dirt, and leaves
his dwelling-place to strangers? or who lays down his garment, and goes out in the days of
winter naked? or what slave that has done his master’s service, shall not be called by him to
supper? or who runs with zeal in the racecourse, and does not get the prize? Philip, behold
my bridal chamber is ready, and blessed is he who has his own shining garment; for he it is
who gets the crown of joy upon his head. Behold, the supper is ready, and blessed is he who
is called by the bridegroom. Great is the harvest of the field; blessed is the able workman.</p>
<p>And when Philip heard these words from the Saviour, he answered and said to him:
Thou didst give us leave, O Jesus of Nazareth, and dost Thou not enjoin us to smite those
who do not wish Thee to reign over them? But this we know, that Thy name has not been
proclaimed in all the world, and Thou hast sent us to this city. And I did not intend to come
into this city, and Thou didst send me, after giving me Thy true commandment, that I should
drive away all deceit, and bring to nothing every idol and demon, and all the power of the
unclean one. And when I came here, the demons fled from our faces through Thy name,
and the dragons and the serpents withered away, but these men did not take to themselves
Thy true light; and for this reason I resolved to bring them low, according to their folly.</p>

<p>And the Saviour said: O Philip, since thou hast forsaken this commandment of mine,
not to render evil for evil,2208 for this reason thou shalt be debarred in the next world for
forty years from being in the place of my promise: besides, this is the end of thy departure
from the body in this place; and Bartholomew has his lot in Lycaonia, and shall be crucified
there; and Mariamne shall lay down her body in the river Jordan.</p>
<p>And the Saviour turned and stretched out His hand, and made the sign of the cross in
the air; and it was full of light, and had its form after the likeness of a ladder. And all the
multitude of the men of the city who had gone down into the abyss came up upon the ladder
of the cross of light and none of them remained in the abyss, but only the tyrant and the
priests, and the viper which they worshipped. And when the multitudes came up from the
abyss, they looked and saw Philip hanging head down, and Bartholomew upon the wall of
the temple, and they also found Mariamne in her first shape. And the Saviour went up into
heaven in the sight of Philip and Bartholomew and Mariamne, and the leopard and the kid
of the goats, and Nicanora and Stachys; and they all with a loud voice glorified God with
fear and trembling, crying out: There is one God who has sent us His salvation, whose name
these men proclaim: we repent therefore of the error in which we were before yesterday,
not being worthy of eternal life; and we believe, having seen the wonderful things that have
come to pass through us. And some of them threw themselves on their faces, and worshipped
the apostles; and others made ready to flee, saying: There may be another earthquake like
the one that has just happened.</p>
<p>And stretching out his hands, the Apostle Philip, hanging head down, said: Men of the
city, hear these words which I am going to say to you, hanging head down. Ye have learned
how great are the powers of God, and the wonders which you saw when your city was destroyed
by the earthquake which came upon it. And this was manifest to you, that the house
of Stachys was not destroyed and that he did not go down into the abyss, because he believed
on the true God, and received us His servants. And I, having fulfilled all the will of my God,
am His debtor for what I requited to him that did evil to me.</p>
<p>And some of those who had been baptized ran to loose Philip hanging head down. And
he answered and said to them: My brethren,…2209 those who are virgins in the members

<note type="footnote">2209 Here a good deal of the text is wanting. The Bodleianms. fills up the blank to some extent:—Walking

be wicked. Many women and men shall leave the work of marriage, and the women shall assume the name of
virginity, but knowing nothing at all about it, and that it has a great and glorious seal. And there shall be many
men in those days in word only, and not in its power; for they shall observe virginity in the members of the flesh,
and commit fornication in their hearts, etc. [Thems. is that referred to on p. 500. Tischendorf gives large extracts</note>

of their flesh and commit fornication in their hearts, and the fornication of their eyes, shall
abound like the deluge. And they grow immoderate from listening to persuasive pleasures,
forgetting the God of the knowledge of the Gospel; and their hearts are full of arrogance,
eating and drinking in their worship, forgetting the holy commandment, and despising it.
That generation is turned aside; but blessed is he that retires into his retreat, for he shall
obtain rest in his departure. Knowest thou not, Bartholomew, that the word of our Lord is
true life and knowledge? for the Lord said to us in His teaching, Every one who shall look
upon a woman, and lust after her in his heart, has completed adultery.2210 And on this account
our brother Peter fled from every place in which a woman was, and yet there was
scandal on account of his own daughter; and he prayed to the Lord, and she had paralysis
of her side, that she might not be deceived. Thou seest, brother, that the sight of the eyes
brings gainsaying, and the beginning of sin, as it is written,2211 She looked, and saw the tree,
that it was pleasing to her eyes, and good for food, and she was deceived. Let the hearing,
then, of the virgins be holy; and in their going out let them walk two and two, for many are
the wiles of the enemy. Let their walk and conversation be well ordered, that they may be
saved; but if not, let their fruit be common.</p>
<p>My brother Bartholomew, give these promises to Stachys, and appoint him ruler and
bishop in the Church, that he may be like thee, teaching well. Do not entrust the office to
a man too young: appoint not such a one to the chair of the teachers, lest thou profane the
witness of Christ. For he that teaches should have his works corresponding to his words,
that the word may be ready on every occasion in its own glory. But I am being released
from my body, hanging head down. Take, then, my body, and prepare it for burial in Syrian
paper, and do not put about it linen cloth, since they put it upon the body of our Lord, and
wrap it close in paper and papyrus, and put it in the vestibule of the holy church. And pray
over me for forty days, that God may forgive the transgression which I did, in that I requited
evil to him that did evil to me, and there may not be for me in the world to come the forty
years.</p>
<p>And after thus speaking, Philip prayed, saying: My Lord Jesus Christ, Father of the ages,
King of all light, who makest us wise in Thy wisdom, who hast given us the exalted knowledge,
who hast graciously conferred upon us the counsel of Thy goodness, who hast never departed
from us; Thou who takest away disease from those who take refuge in Thee; Thou who hast
given us the Word, to turn unto Thee those who have been led astray; Thou who hast given

<head>Acts and Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Andrew.</head>
<p>What we have all, both presbyters and deacons of the churches of Achaia, beheld with
our eyes, we have written to all the churches established in the name of Christ Jesus, both
in the east and west, north and south. Peace to you, and to all who believe in one God,
perfect Trinity, true Father unbegotten, true Son only-begotten, true Holy Spirit proceeding
from the Father, and abiding in the Son, in order that there may be shown one Holy Spirit
subsisting in the Father and Son in precious Godhead. This faith we have learned from the
blessed Andrew, the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose passion also we, having seen it
set forth before our eyes, have not hesitated to give an account of, according to the degree
of ability we have.</p>
<p>Accordingly the proconsul Ægeates,2212 having come into the city of Patras, began to
compel those believing in Christ to worship the idols; to whom the blessed Andrew, running
up, said: It behoved thee, being a judge of men, to acknowledge thy Judge who is in the
heaven, and having acknowledged Him, to worship Him; and worshipping Him who is the
true God, to turn away thy thoughts from those which are not true gods.
To whom Ægeates said: Art thou Andrew, who destroyest the temples of the gods, and
persuadest men about the religion which, having lately made its appearance, the emperors
of the Romans have given orders to suppress?</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: The emperors of the Romans have never recognised the
truth. And this the Son of God, who came on account of the salvation of men, manifestly
teaches—that these idols are not only not gods, but also most shameful demons,2213 and
hostile to the human race, teaching men to offend God, so that, by being offended, He turns
away and will not hearken; that therefore, by His turning away and not hearkening, they
may be held captive by the devil; and that they might work them to such a degree, that when
they go out of the body they may be found deserted and naked, carrying nothing with them
but sins.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: These are superfluous and vain words: as for your Jesus, for proclaiming
these things to the Jews they nailed him to the tree of the cross.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew answering, said: Oh, if thou wouldst recognise the mystery of the
cross, with what reasonable love the Author2214 of the life of the human race for our restoration
endured this tree of the cross, not unwillingly, but willingly!</p>
<note type="footnote">2212 [Another reading is Ægeas. [This is the reading of the Bodleian ms., already frequently referred to (see
 355). In most cases its text is followed in the Latin version collated by Tischendorf.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1568"/>
<p>Ægeates said: Seeing that, betrayed by his own disciple, and seized by the Jews, he was
brought before the procurator, and according to their request was nailed up by the procurator’s
soldiers, in what way dost thou say that he willingly endured the tree of the cross?</p>
<p>The holy Andrew said: For this reason I say willingly, since I was with Him when he
was betrayed by His disciple. For before He was betrayed, He spoke to us to the effect that
He should be betrayed and crucified for the salvation of men, and foretold that He should
rise again on the third day. To whom my brother Peter said,2215 Far be it from thee, Lord;
let this by no means be. And so, being angry, He said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan;
for thou art not disposed to the things of God. And in order that He might most fully explain
that He willingly underwent the passion, He said to us,2216 I have power to lay down my
life, and I have power to take it again. And, last of all, while He was supping with us, He
said,2217 One of you will betray me. At these words, therefore, all becoming exceedingly
grieved, in order that the surmise might be free from doubt, He made it clear, saying, To
whomsoever I shall give the piece of bread out of my hand, he it is who betrays me. When,
therefore, He gave it to one of our fellow-disciples, and gave an account of things to come
as if they were already present, He showed that He was to be willingly betrayed. For neither
did He run away, and leave His betrayer at fault; but remaining in the place in which He
knew that he was, He awaited him.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: I wonder that thou, being a sensible man, shouldst wish to uphold him
on any terms whatever; for, whether willingly or unwillingly, all the same, thou admittest
that he was fastened to the cross.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: This is what I said, if now thou apprehendest, that great is
the mystery of the cross, which, if thou wishest, as is likely, to hear, attend to me.2218
Ægeates said: A mystery it cannot be called, but a punishment.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: This punishment is the mystery of man’s restoration. If thou
wilt listen with any attention, thou wilt prove it.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: I indeed will hear patiently; but thou, unless thou submissively obey me,
shalt receive2219 the mystery of the cross in thyself.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew answered: If I had been afraid of the tree of the cross, I should not
have proclaimed the glory of the cross.</p>

<pb n="1569"/>
<p>Ægeates said: Thy speech is foolish, because thou proclaimest that the cross is not a
punishment, and through thy foolhardiness thou art not afraid of the punishment of death.</p>
<p>The holy Andrew said: It is not through foolhardiness, but through faith, that I am not
afraid of the punishment of death; for the death of sins2220 is hard. And on this account I
wish thee to hear the mystery of the cross, in order that thou perhaps, acknowledging it,
mayst believe, and believing, mayst come somehow or other to the renewing of thy soul.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: That which is shown to have perished is for renewing. Do you mean that
my soul has perished, that thou makest me come to the renewing of it through the faith, I
know not what, of which thou hast spoken?</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew answered: This it is which I desired time to learn, which also I
shall teach and make manifest, that though the souls of men are destroyed, they shall be
renewed through the mystery of the cross. For the first man through the tree of transgression
brought in death; and it was necessary for the human race, that through the suffering of the
tree, death, which had come into the world, should be driven out. And since the first man,
who brought death into the world through the transgression of the tree, had been produced
from the spotless earth, it was necessary that the Son of God should be begotten a perfect
man from the spotless virgin, that He should restore eternal life, which men had lost through
Adam, and should cut off2221 the tree of carnal appetite through the tree of the cross.
Hanging upon the cross, He stretched out His blameless hands for the hands which had
been incontinently stretched out; for the most sweet food of the forbidden tree He received
gall for food; and taking our mortality upon Himself, He made a gift of His immortality to
us.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: With these words thou shalt be able to lead away those who shall believe
in thee; but unless thou hast come to grant me this, that thou offer sacrifices to the almighty
gods, I shall order thee, after having been scourged, to be fastened to that very cross which
thou commendest.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: To God Almighty, who alone is true, I bring sacrifice day by
day; not the smoke of incense, nor the flesh of bellowing bulls, nor the blood of goats, but
sacrificing a spotless lamb day by day on the altar of the cross; and though all the people of
the faithful partake of His body and drink His blood, the Lamb that has been sacrificed remains
after this entire and alive. Truly, therefore, is He sacrificed, and truly is His body
eaten by the people, and His blood is likewise drunk; nevertheless, as I have said, He remains
entire, and spotless, and alive.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: How can this be?</p>
<note type="footnote">2220 Two mss., of sinners.</note>
<note type="footnote">2221 Or, shut out.</note>

<pb n="1570"/>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: If thou wouldest know, take the form of a disciple, that thou
mayst learn what thou art inquiring after.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: I will exact of thee through tortures the gift of this knowledge.</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew declared: I wonder that thou, being an intelligent man, shouldest
fall into2222 the folly of thinking that thou mayst be able to persuade me, through thy tortures,
to disclose to thee the sacred things of God. Thou hast heard the mystery of the cross, thou
hast heard the mystery of the sacrifice. If thou believest in Christ the Son of God, who was
crucified, I shall altogether disclose to thee in what manner the Lamb that has been slain
may live, after having been sacrificed and eaten, remaining in His kingdom entire and
spotless.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: And by what means does the lamb remain in his kingdom after he has
been slain and eaten by all the people, as thou hast said?</p>
<p>The blessed Andrew said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou shalt be able to learn:
but if thou believest not, thou shalt not by any means attain to the idea of such truth.</p>
<p>Then Ægeates, enraged, ordered him to be shut up in prison, where, when he was shut
up, a multitude of the people came together to him from almost all the province, so that
they wished to kill Ægeates, and by breaking down the doors of the prison to set free the
blessed Andrew the apostle.</p>
<p>Them the blessed Andrew admonished in these words, saying: Do not stir up the peace
of our Lord Jesus Christ into seditious and devilish uproar. For my Lord, when He was
betrayed, endured it with all patience; He did not strive, He did not cry out, nor in the streets
did any one hear Him crying out.2223 Therefore do ye also keep silence, quietness, and
peace; and hinder not my martyrdom, but rather get yourselves also ready beforehand as
athletes to the Lord, in order that you may overcome threatenings by a soul that has no fear
of man, and that you may get the better of injuries through the endurance of the body. For
this temporary fall is not to be feared; but that should be feared which has no end. The fear
of men, then, is like smoke which, while it is raised and gathered together, disappears. And
those torments ought to be feared which never have an end. For these torments, which
happen to be somewhat light, any one can bear; but if they are heavy, they soon destroy life.
But those torments are everlasting, where there are daily weepings, and mournings, and
lamentations, and never-ending torture, to which the proconsul Ægeates is not afraid to
go. Be ye therefore rather prepared for this, that through temporary afflictions ye may attain
to everlasting rest, and may flourish for ever, and reign with Christ.2224</p>

<pb n="1571"/>
<p>The holy Apostle Andrew having admonished the people with these and such like words
through the whole night, when the light of day dawned, Ægeates having sent for him, ordered
the blessed Andrew to be brought to him; and having sat down upon the tribunal, he said:
I have thought that thou, by thy reflection during the night, hast turned away thy thoughts
from folly, and given up thy commendation of Christ that thou mightst be able to be with
us, and not throw away the pleasures of life; for it is folly to come for any purpose to the
suffering of the cross, and to give oneself up to most shameful punishments and burnings.</p>
<p>The holy Andrew answered: I shall be able to have joy with thee, if thou wilt believe in
Christ, and throw away the worship of idols; for Christ has sent me to this province, in
which I have acquired for Christ a people not the smallest.</p>
<p>Ægeates said: For this reason I compel thee to make a libation, that these people who
have been deceived by thee may forsake the vanity of thy teaching, and may themselves offer
grateful libations to the gods; for not even one city has remained in Achaia in which their
temples2225 have not been forsaken and deserted. And now, through thee, let them be again
restored to the worship of the images, in order that the gods also, who have been enraged
against thee, being pleased by this, may bring it about that thou mayst return to their
friendship and ours. But if not, thou awaitest varied tortures, on account of the vengeance
of the gods; and after these, fastened to the tree of the cross which thou commendest, thou
shalt die.</p>
<p>The holy Andrew said: Listen, O son of death and chaff made ready for eternal burnings,
2226 to me, the servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ. Until now I have conversed
with thee kindly about the perfection of the faith, in order that thou, receiving the exposition
of the truth, being made perfect as its vindicator, mightst despise vain idols, and worship
God, who is in the heavens; but since thou remainest in the same shamelessness at last, and
thinkest me to be afraid because of thy threats, bring against me whatever may seem to thee
greater in the way of tortures. For the more shall I be well pleasing to my King, the more I
shall endure in tortures for the confession of His name.</p>
<p>Then the proconsul Ægeates, being enraged, ordered the apostle of Christ to be afflicted
by tortures. Being stretched out, therefore, by seven times three2227 soldiers, and beaten
with violence, he was lifted up and brought before the impious Ægeates. And he spoke to
him thus: Listen to me, Andrew, and withdraw thy thoughts from the outpouring of thy
blood; but if thou wilt not hearken to me, I shall cause thee to perish on the tree of the cross.</p>
<p>The holy Andrew said: I am a slave of the cross of Christ, and I ought rather to pray to
attain to the trophy of the cross than to be afraid; but for thee is laid up eternal torment,
<note type="footnote">2225 Or, their sacred rites.</note>

which, however, thou mayst escape after thou hast tested my endurance, if thou wilt believe
in my Christ. For I am afflicted about thy destruction, and I am not disturbed about my
own suffering. For my suffering takes up a space of one day, or two at most; but thy torment
for endless ages shall never come to a close. Wherefore henceforward cease from adding
to thy miseries, and lighting up everlasting fire for thyself.</p>
<p>Ægeates then being enraged, ordered the blessed Andrew to be fastened to the cross.2228
And he having left them all, goes up to the cross, and says to it with a clear voice: Rejoice,
O cross, which has been consecrated by the body of Christ, and adorned by His limbs as if
with pearls. Assuredly before my Lord went up on thee, thou hadst much earthly fear; but
now invested with heavenly longing, thou art fitted up2229 according to my prayer. For I
know, from those who believe, how many graces thou hast in Him, how many gifts prepared
beforehand. Free from care, then, and with joy, I come to thee, that thou also exulting mayst
receive me, the disciple of Him that was hanged upon thee; because thou hast been always
faithful to me, and I have desired to embrace thee. O good cross, which hast received
comeliness and beauty from the limbs of the Lord; O much longed for, and earnestly desired,
and fervently sought after, and already prepared beforehand for my soul longing for thee,
take me away from men, and restore me to my Master, in order that through thee He may
accept me who through thee has redeemed me.</p>
<p>And having thus spoken, the blessed Andrew, standing on the ground, and looking
earnestly upon the cross, stripped himself and gave his clothes to the executioners, having
urged the brethren that the executioners should come and do what had been commanded
them; for they were standing at some distance. And they having come up, lifted him on the
cross; and having stretched his body across with ropes, they only bound his feet, but did not
sever his joints,2230 having received this order from the proconsul: for he wished him to
be in distress while hanging, and in the night-time, as he was suspended, to be eaten up alive
by dogs.2231</p>
<p>And a great multitude of the brethren stood by, nearly twenty thousand; and having
beheld the executioners standing off, and that they had done to the blessed one nothing of

quired of him: Why art thou smiling, Andrew, servant of God? Thy laughter makes us
mourn and weep, because we are deprived of thee. And the blessed Andrew answered him:
Shall I not laugh at all, my son Stratocles, at the empty stratagem of Ægeates, through which
he thinks to take vengeance upon us? We have nothing to do with him and his plans. He
cannot hear; for if he could, he would be aware, having learned it by experience, that a man
of Jesus is unpunished.2232</p>
<p>And having thus spoken, he discoursed to them all in common, for the people ran together
enraged at the unjust judgment of Ægeates: Ye men standing by me, and women,
and children, and elders, bond and free, and as many as will hear; I beseech you, forsake all
this life, ye who have for my sake assembled here; and hasten to take upon you my life, which
leads to heavenly things, and once for all despise all temporary things, confirming the purposes
of those who believe in Christ. And he exhorted them all, teaching that the sufferings
of this transitory life are not worthy to be compared with the future recompense of the
eternal life.</p>
<p>And the multitude hearing what was said by him, did not stand off from the place, and
the blessed Andrew continued the rather to say to them more than he had spoken. And so
much was said by him, that a space of three days and nights was taken up, and no one was
tired and went away from him. And when also on the fourth day they beheld his nobleness,
and the unweariedness of his intellect, and the multitude of his words, and the serviceableness
of his exhortations, and the stedfastness of his soul, and the sobriety of his spirit, and the
fixedness of his mind, and the perfection of his reason, they were enraged against Ægeates;
and all with one accord hastened to the tribunal, and cried out against Ægeates, who was
sitting, saying: What is thy judgment, O proconsul? Thou hast judged wickedly; thy awards
are impious. In what has the man done wrong; what evil has he done? The city has been
put in an uproar; thou grievest us all; do not betray Cæsar’s city. Grant willingly to the
Achaians a just man; grant willingly to us a God-fearing man; do not put to death a godly
man. Four days he has been hanging, and is alive; having eaten nothing, he has filled us all.
Take down the man from the cross, and we shall all seek after wisdom; release the man, and
to all Achaia will mercy be shown. It is not necessary that he should suffer this, because,
though hanging, he does not cease proclaiming the truth.</p>
<p>And when the proconsul refused to listen to them, at first indeed signing with his hand
to the crowd to take themselves off, they began to be emboldened against him, being in
<note type="footnote">2232 Instead of this paragraph, on ms. [the Bodleian] has: And there ran up a great multitude, about twenty
thousand in number, among whom was the brother of Ægeas, Stratocles by name; and he cried out with the
people, It is an unjust judgment. And the holy Andrew, hitting upon the thoughts of the believers, exhorted
them to endure the temporary trial, saying that the suffering counted for nothing when compared with the
eternal recompense.</note>

number about twenty thousand. And the proconsul having beheld that they had somehow
become maddened, afraid that something frightful would befall him, rose up from the
tribunal and went away with them, having promised to set free the blessed Andrew. And
some went on before to tell the apostle the cause for which they came to the place.</p>
<p>While all the crowd, therefore, was exulting that the blessed Andrew was going to be
set free, the proconsul having come up, and all the brethren rejoicing along with Maximilla,
2233 the blessed Andrew, having heard this, said to the brethren standing by: What is
it necessary for me to say to him, when I am departing to the Lord, that will I also say. For
what reason hast thou again come to us, Ægeates? On what account dost thou, being a
stranger to us,2234 come to us? What wilt thou again dare to do, what to contrive? Tell us.
Hast thou come to release us, as having changed thy mind? I would not agree with thee
that thou hadst really changed thy mind. Nor would I believe thee, saying that thou art my
friend. Dost thou, O proconsul, release him that has been bound? By no means. For I have
One with whom I shall be for ever; I have One with whom I shall live to countless ages. To
Him I go; to Him I hasten, who also having made thee known to me, has said to me, Let not
that fearful man terrify thee; do not think that he will lay hold of thee, who art mine: for he
is thine enemy. Therefore, having known thee through him who has turned towards me, I
am delivered from thee. But if thou wishest to believe in Christ, there will be opened up for
time, as I promised thee, a way of access; but if thou hast come only to release me, I shall
not be able after this to be brought down from this cross alive in the body. For I and my
kinsmen depart to our own, allowing thee to be what thou art, and what thou dost not know
about thyself. For already I see my King, already I worship Him, already I stand before Him,
where the fellowship2235 of the angels is, where He reigns the only emperor, where there is
light without night, where the flowers never fade, where trouble is never known, nor the
name of grief heard, where there are cheerfulness and exultation that have no end. O blessed
cross! without the longing for thee, no one enters into that place. But I am distressed,
Ægeates, about thine own miseries, because eternal perdition is ready to receive thee. Run
then, for thine own sake, O pitiable one, while yet thou canst, lest perchance thou shouldst
wish then when thou canst not.</p>
<p>When, therefore, he attempted to come near the tree of the cross, so as to release the
blessed Andrew, with all the city applauding him, the holy Andrew said with a loud voice:
Do not suffer Andrew, bound upon Thy tree, to be released, O Lord; do not give me who
am in Thy mystery to the shameless devil. O Jesus Christ, let not Thine adversary release

me, who have been hanged by Thy favour; O Father, let this insignificant man no longer
humble him who has known Thy greatness. The executioners, therefore, putting out their
hands, were not able at all to touch him. Others, then, and others endeavoured to release
him, and no one at all was able to come near him; for their arms were benumbed.</p>
<p>Then the blessed Andrew, having adjured the people, said: I entreat you earnestly,
brethren, that I may first make one prayer to my Lord. So then set about releasing me. All
the people therefore kept quiet because of the adjuration. Then the blessed Andrew, with
a loud cry, said: Do not permit, O Lord, Thy servant at this time to be removed from Thee;
for it is time that my body be committed to the earth, and Thou shalt order me to come to
Thee. Thou who givest eternal life, my Teacher whom I have loved, whom on this cross I
confess, whom I know, whom I possess, receive me, O Lord; and as I have confessed Thee
and obeyed Thee, so now in this word hearken to me; and, before my body come down from
the cross, receive me to Thyself, that through my departure there may be access to Thee of
many of my kindred, finding rest for themselves in Thy majesty.</p>
<p>When, therefore, he had said this, he became in the sight of all glad and exulting; for an
exceeding splendour like lightning coming forth out of heaven shone down upon him, and
so encircled him, that in consequence of such brightness mortal eyes could not look upon
him at all. And the dazzling light remained about the space of half an hour. And when he
had thus spoken and glorified the Lord still more, the light withdrew itself, and he gave up
the ghost, and along with the brightness itself he departed to the Lord in giving Him thanks.</p>
<p>And after the decease of the most blessed Andrew the apostle, Maximilla being the most
powerful of the notable women,2236 and continuing among those who had come, as soon
as she learned that the apostle had departed to the Lord, came up and turned her attention
to the cross, along with Stratocles, taking no heed at all of those standing by, and with reverence
took down the body of the most blessed apostle from the cross. And when it was
evening, bestowing upon him the necessary care, she prepared the body for burial with
costly spices, and laid it in her own tomb. For she had been parted from Ægeates on account
of his brutal disposition and lawless conduct, having chosen for herself a holy and quiet life;
and having been united to the love of Christ, she spent her life blessedly along with the
brethren.</p>
<p>Ægeates had been very importunate with her, and promised that he would make her
mistress of his wealth; but not having been able to persuade her, he was greatly enraged,
and was determined to make a public charge against all the people, and to send to Cæsar
an accusation against both Maximilla and all the people. And while he was arranging these
things in the presence of his officers, at the dead of night he rose up, and unseen by all his

people, having been tormented by the devil, he fell down from a great height, and rolling
into the midst of the market-place of the city, breathed his last.</p>
<p>And this was reported to his brother Stratocles; and he sent his servants, having told
them that they should bury him among those who had died a violent death. But he sought
nothing of his substance, saying: Let not my Lord Jesus Christ, in whom I have believed,
suffer me to touch anything whatever of the goods of my brother, that the condemnation
of him who dared to cut off the apostle of the Lord may not disgrace me.</p>
<p>These things were done in the province of Achaia, in the city of Patras on the day before
the kalends of December,2237 where his good deeds are kept in mind even to this day, to
the glory and praise of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.2238</p>

<head>Acts of Andrew and Matthias2239
In the City of the Man-eaters.</head>
<p>About that time all the apostles had come together to the same place, and shared among
themselves the countries, casting lots, in order that each might go away into the part that
had fallen to him. By lot, then, it fell to Matthias to set out to the country of the man-eaters.
And the men of that city used neither to eat bread nor drink wine; but they ate the flesh of
men, and drank their blood. Every man, therefore, who came into their city they laid hold
of, and digging they thrust out his eyes, and gave him a drug to drink, prepared by sorcery
and magic; and from drinking the drug his heart was altered and his mind deranged.</p>
<p>Matthias then having come into the gate of their city, the men of that city laid hold of
him, and thrust out his eyes; and after putting them out they made him drink the drug of
their magical deception, and led him away to the prison, and put beside him grass to eat,
and he ate it not. For when he had partaken of their drug, his heart was not altered, nor his
mind deranged; but he kept praying to God, weeping, and saying: Lord Jesus Christ, for
whose sake we have forsaken all things and have followed Thee, knowing that Thou art the
helper of all who hope in Thee, attend then and behold what they have done to Matthias
Thy servant, how they have made me nigh to the brutes; for Thou art He who knowest all
things. If, therefore, Thou hast ordained that the wicked men in this city should eat me up,
I will not by any means flee from Thy dispensation. Afford to me then, O Lord, the light
of mine eyes, that at least I may behold what the wicked men in this city have in hand for
me; do not forsake me, O my Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give me up to this bitter death.</p>
<p>While Matthias was thus praying in the prison, a light shone, and there came forth out
of the light a voice saying: Beloved Matthias, receive thy sight. And immediately he received
his sight. And again there came forth a voice saying: Be of good courage, our Matthias,
and be not dismayed; for I shall not by any means forsake thee, for I shall deliver thee from
all danger; and not only thee, but also all thy brethren who are with thee: for I am with thee
everywhere and at all times. But remain here twenty-seven days for the edification2240 of
many souls; and after that I shall send forth Andrew to thee, and he shall lead thee forth out
of this prison; and not thee only, but also all who hear. Having said this, the Saviour said
again to Matthias, Peace be to thee, our Matthias, and went into heaven. Then Matthias
having beheld Him, said to the Lord: Let thy grace abide with me, O my Lord Jesus.</p>
<note type="footnote">2239 The oldestms. has Matthias; the four or five others have Matthew.</note>
<note type="footnote">2240 Lit., oeconomy.</note>

<pb n="1578"/>
<p>Then Matthias therefore2241 sat down in the prison, and sang. And it came to pass that,
when the executioners came into the prison to bring forth the men to eat them, Matthias
also shut his eyes, that they might not behold that he saw. And the executioners having
come to him, read the ticket in his hand, and said among themselves: Yet three days, and
we shall bring out this one also from the prison, and slay him. Because in the case of every
man whom they laid hold of, they noted that day on which they laid hold of him, and tied
a ticket to his right hand, that they might know the completion of the thirty days.</p>
<p>And it came to pass when the twenty-seven days were fulfilled since Matthias was seized,
the Lord appeared in the country where Andrew was teaching, and said to him: Rise up,
and set out with thy disciples to the country of the man-eaters, and bring forth Matthias
out of that place; for yet three days, and the men of the city will bring him forth and slay
him for their food. And Andrew answered and said: My Lord, I shall not be able to accomplish
the journey thither before the limited period of the three days; but send Thine angel
quickly, that he may bring him out thence: for thou knowest, Lord, that I also am flesh, and
shall not be able to go there quickly. And He says to Andrew: Obey Him who made thee,
and Him who is able to say in a word, and that city shall be removed thence, and all that
dwell in it. For I command the horns of the winds,2242 and they drive it thence. But rise
up early, and go down to the sea with thy disciples, and thou shalt find a boat upon the
shore, and thou shalt go aboard with thy disciples. And having said this, the Saviour again
said: Peace to thee, Andrew, along with those with thee! And He went into the heavens.</p>
<p>And Andrew having risen up early, proceeded to the sea along with his disciples; and
having come down to the shore, he saw a little boat, and in the boat three men sitting. For
the Lord by His own power had prepared a boat, and He it was in human shape a pilot in
the boat; and He brought two angels whom He made to appear like men, and they were in
the boat sitting.2243 Andrew, therefore, having beheld the boat, and the three who were in
it, rejoiced with exceeding great joy; and having gone to them, he said: Where are you going,
brethren, with this little boat? And the Lord answered and said to him: We are going to
the country of the man-eaters. And Andrew having beheld Jesus, did not recognise Him;
for Jesus was hiding His Godhead, and He appeared to Andrew like a pilot. And Jesus
having heard Andrew saying, I too am going to the country of the man-eaters, says to him:
Every man avoids that city, and how are you going there? And Andrew answered and said:
We have some small business to do there, and we must get through with it; but if thou canst,

were, the master of the boat.</note>

<pb n="1579"/>
do us this kindness to convey us to the country of the man-eaters, to which also you intend
to go. Jesus answered and said to them: Come on board.</p>
<p>And Andrew said: I wish to make some explanation to thee, young man, before we
come on board thy boat. And Jesus said: Say what thou wilt. And Andrew said to Him:
We have no passage-money to give thee; we have not even bread for our nourishment. And
Jesus answered and said to him: How, then, are you going away without giving us the passage-
money, and without having bread for your nourishment? And Andrew said to Jesus,
Listen, brother; do not think that it is through masterfulness that we do not give thee our
passage-money, but we are disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ, the good God. For He chose
for Himself us twelve, and gave us such a commandment, saying, When you go to preach,
do not carry money in the journey, nor bread, nor bag, nor shoes, nor staff, nor two coats.2244
If, therefore, thou wilt do us the kindness, brother, tell us at once; if not, let us know, and
we shall go and seek another boat for ourselves. And Jesus answered and said to Andrew:
If this is the commandment which you received, and you keep it, come on board my boat
with all joy. For I really wish you, the disciples of Him who is called Jesus, to come on board
my boat, rather than those who give me of their silver and gold; for I am altogether worthy
that the apostle of the Lord should come on board my boat. And Andrew answered and
said: Permit me, brother, may the Lord grant thee glory and honour. And Andrew went
on board the boat with his disciples.</p>
<p>And having gone on board, he sat down by the boat’s sail. And Jesus answered and said
to one of the angels: Rise and go down to the hold of the boat, and bring up three loaves,
that the men may eat, lest perchance they be hungry, from having come to us off a long
journey. And he rose and went down to the hold of the boat, and brought up three loaves,
as the Lord commanded him; and he gave them the loaves. Then Jesus said to Andrew:
Rise up, brother, with thy friends; partake of food, that you may be strong to bear the tossing
of the sea. And Andrew answered and said to his disciples: My children, we have found
great kindness from this man. Stand up, then, and partake of the nourishment of bread,
that you may be strong to bear the tossing of the sea. And his disciples were not able to
answer him a word, for they were in distress because of the sea. Then Jesus forced Andrew
to partake himself also of the nourishment of bread along with his disciples. And Andrew
answered and said to Jesus, not knowing that it was Jesus: Brother, may the Lord give thee
heavenly bread out of His kingdom. Allow me then brother; for thou seest the children,
that they are distressed because of the sea. And Jesus answered and said to Andrew: Assuredly
the brethren are without experience of the sea; but inquire of them whether they
want to go to land, and thyself to remain, until thou shalt finish thy business, and again
come back to them. Then Andrew said to his disciples: My children, do you wish to go to
<note type="footnote">2244 Matt. x. 10; Mark vi. 9.</note>

<pb n="1580"/>
the land, and me to remain here until I shall finish my business for which I have been sent?
And they answered and said to Andrew: If we go away from thee, may we become strangers
to the good things which the Lord hath provided for us. Now, therefore, we are with thee,
wherever thou mayst go.</p>
<p>Jesus answered and said to Andrew: If thou art truly a disciple of Him who is called
Jesus, tell thy disciples the miracles which thy Teacher did, that their soul may rejoice, and
that they may forget the fear of the sea; for, behold, we are going to take the boat off from
the land. And immediately Jesus said to one of the angels: Let go the boat; and he let go
the boat from the land. And Jesus came and sat down beside the rudder, and steered the
boat. Then Andrew exhorted and comforted his disciples, saying: My children, who have
given up your life to the Lord, fear not; for the Lord will not at all forsake you for ever. For
at that time when I was alone with our Lord, we went on board the boat with Him, and He
lay down to sleep in the boat, trying us; for He was not2245 fast asleep. And a great wind
having arisen, and the sea being stormy, so that the waves were uplifted, and came under
the sail of the boat, and when we were in great fear, the Lord stood up and rebuked the
winds, and there was a calm in the sea; for all things feared Him, as being made by Him.2246
Now, therefore, my children, fear not. For the Lord Jesus will not at all forsake us. And
having said this, the holy Andrew prayed in his heart that his disciples might be led to sleep.
And as Andrew was praying, his disciples fell asleep.</p>
<p>And Andrew, turning round to the Lord, not knowing that it was the Lord, said to Him:
Tell me, O man, and show me the skill of thy steering; for I have never seen any man so
steering in the sea as I now see thee. For sixteen years have I sailed the sea, and behold this
is the seventeenth, and I have not seen such skill; for truly the boat is just as if on land. Show
me then, young man, thy skill. Then Jesus answered and said to Andrew: We also have
often sailed the sea, and been in danger; but since thou art a disciple of Him called Jesus,
the sea has recognised thee that thou art righteous, and has become calm, and has not lifted
its waves against the boat. Then Andrew cried out with a loud voice, saying: I thank Thee,
my Lord Jesus Christ, that I have met a man who glorifies Thy name.</p>
<p>And Jesus answered and said: O Andrew, tell me, thou disciple of Him called Jesus,
wherefore the unbelieving Jews did not believe in Him, saying that He was not God, but
man. Show me, O disciple of Him called Jesus; for I have heard that He showed His Godhead
to His disciples. And Andrew answered and said: Truly, brother, He showed us that He
was God. Do not think, then, that He is man. For He made the heaven, and the earth, and
the sea, and all that is in them. And Jesus answered and said: How then did the Jews not
believe Him? Perhaps He did not do miracles before them? Andrew said: Hast thou not
<note type="footnote">2245 One ms. omits the negative.</note>
<note type="footnote">2246 Comp. Matt. viii. 26.</note>

<pb n="1581"/>
heard of the miracles which He did before them? He made the blind see, the lame walk, the
deaf hear; He cleansed lepers, He changed water into wine; and having taken five loaves and
two fishes, He made a crowd recline on the grass, and having blessed, He gave them to eat;
and those that ate were five thousand men,2247 and they were filled: and they took up what
was over to them twelve baskets of fragments.2248 And after all these things they did not
believe Him.</p>
<p>And Jesus answered and said to Andrew: Perhaps He did these miracles before the
people, and not before the chief priests, and because of this they did not believe Him.
And Andrew answered and said: Nay, brother, He did them also before the chief priests,
not only openly, but also in secret, and they did not believe Him. Jesus answered and said:
What are the miracles which He did in secret? Disclose them to me. And Andrew answered
and said: O man, who hast the spirit of inquisitiveness, why dost thou put me to the test?
And Jesus answered and said: I do not put thee to the test by saying this, O disciple of Him
called Jesus; but my soul rejoices and exults, and not only mine, but also every soul that
hears the wonders of Jesus.</p>
<p>And Andrew answered and said: O child, the Lord shall fill thy soul with all joy and all
good, as thou hast persuaded me now to relate to thee the miracles which our Lord did in
secret.</p>
<p>It came to pass as we, the twelve disciples, were going with our Lord into a temple of
the Gentiles, that He might make known to us the ignorance of the devil, that the chief
priests, having beheld us following Jesus, said to us, O wretches, why do you walk with him
who says, I am the Son of God? Do you mean to say that God has a son? Which of you has
ever at any time seen God associating with a woman? Is not this the son of Joseph the carpenter,
and his mother is Mary, and his brothers James and Simon?2249 And when we heard
these words, our hearts were turned into weakness. And Jesus, having known that our hearts
were giving way, took us into a desert place, and did great miracles before us, and displayed
to us all His Godhead. And we spoke to the chief priests, saying, Come ye also, and see; for,
behold, He has persuaded us.</p>
<p>And the chief priests having come, went with us; and when we had gone into the temple
of the Gentiles, Jesus showed us the heaven,2250 that we might know whether the things
were true or not. And there went in along with us thirty men of the people, and four chief
priests. And Jesus, having looked on the right hand and on the left of the temple, saw two

<note type="footnote">2250 There seems to be something wrong here. One ms. has, the structure of the temple, and omits the following

<pb n="1582"/>
sculptured sphinxes, one on the right and one on the left. And Jesus having turned to us,
said, Behold the sign of the cross; for these are like the cherubim and the seraphim which
are in heaven. Then Jesus, having looked to the right, where the sphinx was, said to it, I say
unto thee, thou image of that which is in heaven, which the hands of craftsmen have sculptured,
be separated from thy place, and come down, and answer and convict the chief priests,
and show them whether I am God or man.</p>
<p>And immediately at that very time the sphinx removed from its place, and having assumed
a human voice, said, O foolish sons of Israel, not only has the blinding of their own
hearts not been enough for them, but they also wish others to be blind like themselves,
saying that God is man, who in the beginning fashioned man, and put His breath into all,
who gave motion to those things which moved not; He it is who called Abraham, who loved
his son Isaac, who brought back his beloved Jacob into his land; He is the Judge of living
and dead; He it is who prepareth great benefits for those who obey Him, and prepareth
punishment for those who believe Him not. Heed not that I am an idol that can be handled;
for I say unto you, that the sacred places of your synagogue are more excellent.2251 For
though we are stones, the priests have given us only the name of a god; and those priests
who serve the temple purify themselves, being afraid of the demons: for if they have had
intercourse with women, they purify themselves seven days, because of their fear; so that
they do not come into the temple because of us, because of the name which they have given
us, that we are a god. But you, if you have committed fornication, take up the law of God,
and go into the synagogue of God, and purify, and read, and do not reverence the glorious
words of God. Because of this, I say unto you, that the holy things purify your synagogues,
so that they also become churches of His only begotten Son. The sphinx having said this,
ceased speaking.</p>
<p>And we said to the chief priests, Now it is fitting that you should believe, because even
the stones have convicted you. And the Jews answered and said, By magic these stones
speak, and do not you think that it is a god? For if you have tested what has been said by
the stone, you have ascertained its deception. For where did he find Abraham, or how did
he see him? For Abraham died many years before he was born, and how does he know him?</p>
<p>And Jesus, having again turned to the image, said to it, Because these believe not that I

Rise up, thou and thy son Isaac, and the son of thy son Jacob, and come to the temples of
the Jebusites, that we may convict the chief priests, in order that they may know that I am
acquainted with thee, and thou with me. And when the sphinx heard these words, immediately
she walked about in the presence of us all, and set out for the land of the Canaanites
to the field of Mamre, and cried outside of the tomb, as God had commanded her. And
straightway the twelve patriarchs2253 came forth alive out of the tomb, and answered and
said to her, To which of us hast thou been sent? And the sphinx answered and said, I have
been sent to the three patriarchs for testimony; but do ye go in, and rest until the time of
the resurrection. And having heard, they went into the tomb and fell asleep. And the three
patriarchs set out along with the sphinx to Jesus, and convicted the chief priests. And Jesus
said to them, Go away to your places; and they went away. And He said also to the image,
Go up to thy place; and straightway she went up and stood in her place. And He did also
many other miracles, and they did not believe Him; which miracles, if I shall recount, thou
wilt not be able to bear. And Jesus answered and said to him: I can bear it; for I prudently
listen to profitable words.</p>
<p>And when the boat was about to come near the land, Jesus bent down His head upon
one of His angels, and was quiet. And Andrew ceased speaking; and he also, reclining his
head upon one of his disciples, fell asleep. And Jesus said to His angels: Spread your hands
under him, and carry Andrew and his disciples, and go and put them outside of the city of
the man-eaters; and having laid them on the ground, return to me. And the angels did as
Jesus commanded them, and the angels returned to Jesus: and He went up into the heavens
with His angels.</p>
<p>And when it was morning, Andrew, having awakened and looked up, found himself
sitting on the ground; and having looked,2254 he saw his disciples sleeping on the ground:
and he wakened them, and said to them: Rise up, my children, and know the great dispensation
that has happened to us, and learn that the Lord was with us in the boat, and we knew
Him not; for He transformed Himself as if He were a pilot in the boat, and humbled Himself,
and appeared to us as a man, putting us to the test. And Andrew, recovering himself, said:
Lord, I recognised Thy excellent words, but Thou didst not manifest Thyself to me, and
because of this I did not know Thee. And his disciples answered and said to him: Father
Andrew, do not think that we knew when thou wast speaking with Him in the boat, for we
were weighed down by a most heavy sleep; and eagles came down out of the heavens, and
lifted up our souls, and took them away into the paradise in heaven, and we saw great
wonders. For we beheld our Lord Jesus sitting on a throne of glory, and all the angels round
about Him. We beheld also Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the saints; and David

praised Him with a song upon his harp. And we beheld there you the twelve apostles
standing by in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and outside of you twelve angels round
about you, and each angel standing behind each of you, and they were like you in appearance.
And we heard the Lord saying to the angels, Listen to the apostles in all things whatsoever
they shall ask you. These are the things which we have seen, father Andrew, until thou didst
awake us; and angels, who appeared like eagles, brought our souls into our bodies.</p>
<p>Then Andrew, having heard, rejoiced with great joy that his disciples had been deemed
worthy to behold these wonderful things. And Andrew looked up into heaven, and said:
Appear to me, Lord Jesus Christ; for I know that Thou art not far from Thy servants. Pardon
me, Lord, for what I have done; for I have beheld Thee as a man in the boat, and I have
conversed with Thee as with a man. Now therefore, Lord, manifest Thyself to me in this
place.</p>
<p>And when Andrew had said this, Jesus appeared to him in the likeness of a most beautiful
little child. And Jesus answered and said: Hail, our Andrew! And Andrew, having
beheld Him, worshipped Him, saying: Pardon me, Lord Jesus Christ, for I saw Thee like a
man on the sea, and conversed with Thee. What is there, then, wherein I have sinned, my
Lord Jesus, that Thou didst not manifest Thyself to me on the sea? And Jesus answered and
said to Andrew: Thou hast not sinned, but I did this to thee because thou saidst, I shall not
be able to go to the city of the man-eaters in three days; and I have showed thee that I am
able to do all things, and to appear to every one as I wish. Now therefore rise up, go into
the city to Matthias, and bring him forth out of the prison, and all the strangers that are
with him. For, behold, I show thee, Andrew, what thou must suffer before going into this
city. They will heap upon thee tortures and insults, and scatter thy flesh in the ways and
the streets, and thy blood shall flow to the ground, but they are not able to put thee to death;
but endure, just as thou sawest me beaten, insulted, and crucified: for there are those who
are destined to believe in this city. And having said this, the Saviour went into the heavens.</p>
<p>And Andrew went into the city along with his disciples, and no one beheld him. And
when he came to the prison, he saw seven warders standing at the gate guarding, and he
prayed within himself, and they fell down and expired; and he marked the gate with the sign
of the cross, and it opened of its own accord. And having gone in with his disciples, he
found Matthias sitting and singing; and seeing him, he stood up, and they saluted each
other with a holy kiss; and he said to Matthias: Brother, how hast thou been found here?
For yet three days, and they will bring thee out to be food for them. Where are the great
mysteries which thou hast been taught, and the wonderful things which we have believed?
And Matthias said to him: Didst thou not hear the Lord saying, I shall send you like sheep
into the midst of wolves?2255 They straightway brought me into the prison, and I prayed
<note type="footnote">2255 Matt. x. 16.</note>

<pb n="1585"/>
to the Lord; and He said to me, Remain here twenty-seven days, and I shall send thee Andrew,
and he will bring thee forth out of the prison. And now, behold, it has come to pass as the
Lord said.</p>
<p>Then Andrew, having looked, saw three men shut up eating grass naked; and he beat
his breast, and said: Consider, O Lord, what the men suffer; how have they made them like
the irrational brutes? And he says to Satan: Woe to thee, the devil, the enemy of God, and
to thine angels, because the strangers here have done nothing to thee; and how hast thou
brought upon them the punishment? how long dost thou war against the human race?
Thou didst bring forth Adam out of paradise, and didst cause men to be mixed up with
transgression; and the Lord was enraged, and brought on the deluge so as to sweep man
away. And again hast thou made thy appearance in this city too, in order that thou mayst
make those who are here eat men,2256 that the end of them also may be in execration and
destruction, thinking in thyself that God will sweep away the work of His hands. Hast thou
not heard that God said, I will not bring a deluge upon the earth?2257 but if there is any
punishment prepared, it is for the sake of taking vengeance upon thee.</p>
<p>Then he stood up, and Andrew and Matthias prayed; and after the prayer Andrew laid
his hands upon the faces of the blind men who were in the prison, and straightway they all
received their sight. And again he laid his hand upon their hearts, and their minds were
changed into human reason. Then Andrew answered them: Rise up, and go into the lower
parts of the city, and you shall find in the way a great fig-tree, and sit under the fig-tree, and
eat of its fruit, until I come to you; but if I delay coming there, you will find abundance of
food for yourselves: for the fruit shall not fail from the fig-tree, but according as you eat it
shall produce more fruit, and nourish you, as the Lord has said. And they answered and
said to Andrew: Go along with us, O our master, lest perchance the wicked men of this city
again see us, and shut us up, and inflict upon us greater and more dreadful tortures than
they have inflicted upon us. And Andrew answered and said to them: Go; for in truth I say
to you, that as you go, not a dog shall bark with his tongue against you. And there were in
all two hundred and seventy men and forty-nine women2258 whom Andrew released from
the prison. And the men went as the blessed Andrew said to them; and he made Matthias
go along with his disciples out of the eastern gate of the city. And Andrew commanded a
cloud, and the cloud took up Matthias and the disciples of Andrew; and the cloud set them
down on the mountain where Peter was teaching,2259 and they remained beside him.</p>

<p>And Andrew, having gone forth from the prison, walked about in the city; and having
seen a brazen pillar, and a statue standing upon it, he came and sat down behind that pillar
until he should see what should happen. And it happened that the executioners went to the
prison to bring out the men for their food,2260 according to the custom; and they found the
doors of the prison opened, and the guards that guarded it lying dead upon the ground.
And straightway they went, and reported to the rulers of the city, saying: We found the
prison opened, and having gone inside we found nobody;2261 but we found the guards lying
dead upon the ground. And the rulers having heard this, said among themselves: What,
then, has happened? You do not mean to say that some persons have gone into the prison
of the city, and have killed the warders, and taken away those that were shut up? And they
spoke to the executioners, saying: Go to the prison, and bring the men that are dead, that
we may eat them up to-day. And let us go to-morrow, and bring together all the old men
of the city, that they may cast lots upon themselves, until the seven lots come, and we slay
seven each day. And they shall be to us for food until we may choose young men, and put
them in boats as sailors, that they may go away to the countries round about, and attack
them, and bring some men here, that they may be for food to us.</p>
<p>And the executioners went to the prison, and brought the seven men that were dead;
and there was an oven built in the midst of the city, and there lay in the oven a large trough
in which they killed the men, and their blood ran down into the trough, and they drew out
of the blood and drank it. And they brought the men, and. put them into the trough. And
when the executioners were lifting their hands against them, Andrew heard a voice, saying:
Behold, Andrew, what is happening in this city. And Andrew having beheld, prayed to the
Lord, saying: Lord Jesus Christ, who didst order me to come into this city, do not suffer
those in this city to do any evil, but let the knives go out of the hands of the wicked ones.
And straightway the knives of the wicked men fell, and their hands were turned into stone.
And the rulers, having seen what had happened, wept, saying: Woe unto us, for here are
the magicians who have gone into the prison, and brought out the men; for, behold, they
have bewitched these also. What, then, shall we do? Let us go now, and gather together the
old men of the city, seeing that we are hungry.</p>
<p>And they went and gathered them together, and found two hundred and seventeen;
and they brought them to the rulers, and they made them cast lots, and the lot came upon
seven old men. And one of those taken by lot answered and said to the officers: I pray you,
I have for myself one son; take him, and slay him instead of me, and let me go. And the
officers answered and said to him: We cannot take thy son, unless we bring him first to our
superiors. And the officers went and told the rulers. And the rulers answered and said to
<note type="footnote">2260 i.e., to be eaten by them.</note>
<note type="footnote">2261 Comp. Acts v. 20–25.</note>

<pb n="1587"/>
the officers: If he give us his son instead of himself, let him go. And the officers went and
told the old man. And the old man answered and said to them: I have also a daughter along
with my son; take them, and kill them, only let me go. And he gave his children to the officers,
that they might kill them. And the children wept to each other, and prayed the officers,
saying: We pray you do not kill us, as we are of so small a size; but let us complete our size,
and so kill us. For it was a custom in that city, and they did not bury their dead, but ate
them up. And the officers did not hearken to the children, nor take pity upon them, but
carried them to the trough weeping and praying.</p>
<p>And it happened, as they were leading them away to kill them, that Andrew, having
beheld what happened, shed tears; and weeping, he looked up to heaven and said: Lord Jesus
Christ, as Thou didst hear me in the case of the dead men, and didst not suffer them to be
eaten up, so also now hear me, that the executioners may not inflict death upon these children,
but that the knives may be loosened out of the hands of the executioners.2262 And
straightway the knives were loosened, and fell out of the hands of the executioners. And
when this came to pass, the executioners, having beheld what had happened, were exceedingly
afraid. And Andrew, seeing what had happened, glorified the Lord because He had listened
to him in every work.</p>
<p>And the rulers, having beheld what had happened, wept with a great weeping, saying:
Woe unto us! what are we to do? And, behold, the devil appeared in the likeness of an old
man, and began to say in the midst of all: Woe unto you! because you are now dying, having
no food; what can sheep and oxen do for you? They will not at all be enough for you. But
rise up, and make a search here for one who has come to the city, a stranger named Andrew,
and kill him; for if you do not, he will not permit you to carry on this practice longer: for
it was he who let loose the men out of the prison. Assuredly the man is in this city, and you
have not seen2263 him. Now, therefore, rise and make search for him, in order that henceforward
you may be able to collect your food.</p>
<p>And Andrew saw the devil, how he was talking to the multitudes; but the devil did not
see the blessed Andrew. Then Andrew answered the devil, and said: O Belial most fiendish,
who art the foe of every creature;2264 but my Lord Jesus Christ will bring thee down to the
abyss. And the devil, having heard this, said: I hear thy voice indeed, and I know thy voice,
but where thou art standing I know not. And Andrew answered and said to the devil: Why,
then, hast thou been called Amael?2265 is it not because thou art blind, not seeing all the
saints? And the devil, having heard this, said to the citizens: Look round now for him

speaking to me, for he is the man. And the citizens, having run in different directions, shut
the gates of the city, and searched for the blessed one, and did not see him.2266 Then the
Lord showed Himself to Andrew, and said to him; Andrew, rise up and show thyself to
them, that they may learn my power, and the powerlessness of the devil working in them.</p>
<p>Then Andrew rose up, and said in presence of all: Behold, I am Andrew whom you
seek. And the multitudes ran upon him, and laid hold of him, saying: What thou hast done
to us, we also will do to thee. And they reasoned among themselves, saying: By what death
shall we kill him? And they said to each other: If we take off his head, his death is not torture;
and if we burn him, he will not be for food to us. Then one of them, the devil having entered
into him, answered and said to the multitudes: As he has done to us, so let us also do to
him. Let us rise up, then, and fasten a rope to his neck, and drag him through all the streets
and lanes of the city; and when he is dead, we shall share his body. And they did as he said
to them; and having fastened a rope round his neck, they dragged him through the streets
and lanes of the city, and the flesh of the blessed Andrew stuck to the ground, and his blood
flowed to the ground like water. And when it was evening they cast him into the prison,
having bound his hands behind him; and he was in sore distress.</p>
<p>And in the morning again they brought him out, and having fastened a rope round his
neck, they dragged him about; and again his flesh stuck to the ground, and his blood flowed.
And the blessed one wept and prayed, saying: Do not forsake me, my Lord Jesus Christ;
for I know that Thou art not far from Thy servants. And as he was praying, the devil walked
behind, and said to the multitudes: Strike him on the mouth, that he may not speak.2267</p>
<p>And when it was evening they took him again to the prison, having bound his hands
behind him, and left him till the morrow again. And the devil having taken with himself
seven demons2268 whom the blessed one had cast out of the countries round about, and
having gone into the prison, they stood before him, wishing to kill him. And the demons
answered and said to Andrew: Now hast thou fallen into our hands; where is thy glory and
thy exultation, thou that raisest thyself up against us, and dishonourest us, and tellest our
doings to the people in every place and country, and hast made our workshops and our
temples to become desolate, in order that sacrifices may not be brought to them? Because

cause the people here to eat up men.</note>

of this, then, we shall also kill thee, like thy teacher called Jesus, and John whom Herod beheaded.
2269</p>
<p>And they stood before Andrew, wishing to kill him; and having beheld the seal upon
his forehead which the Lord gave him, they were afraid, and did not come near him, but
fled. And the devil said to them: Why have you fled from him, my children, and not killed
him? And the demons answered and said to the devil: We cannot kill him, but kill him if
thou art able; for we knew him before he came into the distress of his humiliation. Then
one of the demons answered and said: We cannot kill him, but come let us mock him in
the distress of his humiliation. And the demons came and stood before him, and scoffed
at him. And the blessed one hearing, wept; and there came to him a voice saying: Andrew,
why weepest thou? And it was the voice of the devil changed. And Andrew answered and
said: I am weeping because God commanded me, saying, Be patient toward them. And the
devil said: If thou canst do anything, do it. And Andrew answered and said: Is it for this,
then, that you do these things to me? But forbid it that I should disobey the commandment
of my Lord; for if the Lord shall make for me a charge2270 in this city, I shall chastise you
as you deserve. And having heard this, they fled.</p>
<p>And when it was morning they brought him out again, and having fastened a rope about
his neck, they dragged him; and again his flesh stuck to the ground, and his blood flowed
to the ground like water. And the blessed one, as he was being dragged along, wept, saying:
Lord Jesus Christ, be not displeased with me; for Thou knowest, Lord, what the fiend has
inflicted upon me, along with his demons. These tortures are enough, my Lord; for, behold,
I am dragged about for three days. But do Thou, Lord, remember that Thou wast three
hours upon the cross, and didst cry out to the Father, My Father, why hast Thou forsaken
me?2271 Where are Thy words, Lord, which Thou spakest to us, confirming us, when we
walked about with Thee, saying to us, Ye shall not lose one hair?2272 Consider, then, Lord,
what has become of my flesh, and the hairs of my head. Then Jesus said to Andrew: O our
Andrew, the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.2273
Turn thyself then, Andrew, and behold thy flesh that has fallen, and thy hair, what has become
of them. And Andrew turned, and saw great trees springing up, bearing fruit; and he glorified
God.</p>

<p>And when it was evening they took him up again, and cast him into the prison, having
bound his hands behind him; and he was exceedingly exhausted. And the men of the city
said among themselves: Perhaps he dies in the night, and we do not find him alive on the
following day; for he was languid, and his flesh was spent.</p>
<p>And the Lord appeared in the prison, and having stretched out His hand, said to Andrew:
Give me thy hand, and rise up whole. And Andrew, having beheld the Lord Jesus, gave Him
his hand, and rose up whole. And falling down, he worshipped Him, and said: I thank
Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, that Thou hast speedily brought help to me. And Andrew,
having looked into the middle of the prison, saw a pillar standing, and upon the pillar there
stood an alabaster statue. And Andrew, having gone up to the statue, unfolded his hands
seven times, and said to the pillar, and the statue upon it: Fear the sign of the cross, which
the heaven and the earth dread; and let the statue set upon the pillar bring up much water
through its mouth, until all who are in this city be punished. And say not, I am stone, and
am not worthy to praise the Lord, for the Lord fashioned us from the earth; but you are
pure, because that out of you He gave the tables of the law.2274 When the blessed Andrew
had said this, straightway the stone statue cast out of its mouth water in abundance, as if
out of a canal. And the water stood high upon the earth; and it was exceedingly acrid, eating
into the flesh of men.</p>
<p>And when it was morning, the men of the city saw it, and began to flee, saying in
themselves: Woe to us! because we are now dying. And the water killed their cattle and
their children; and they began to flee out of the city. Then Andrew prayed, saying: Lord
Jesus Christ, in whom I have hoped that this miracle should come upon this city, forsake
me not, but send Michael Thy archangel in a cloud of fire, and be a wall round the city, that
no one may be able to escape out of the fire. And straightway a cloud of fire came down
and encircled the city like a wall; and the water was as high as the neck of those men, and
it was eating them up exceedingly. And they wept, saying: Woe to us! for all these things
have come upon us because of the stranger who is in the prison. Let us go and release him,
lest perchance we die.</p>
<p>And they went out, crying with a loud voice: God of the stranger, take away from us
this water. And the apostle knew that they were in great affliction, and said to the alabaster
statue: Stop the water, for they have repented. And I say to thee, that if the citizens of this
city shall believe, I will build a church, and place thee in it, because thou hast done me this
service. And the statue ceased flowing, and no longer brought forth water. And the men
of the city, having come out to the doors of the prison, cried out, saying: Have pity upon
us, God of the stranger, and do not according to our unbelief, and according to what we
<note type="footnote">2274 One ms. has: Yea, for assuredly you have been honoured: for God did not write the law for His people

have done to this man, but take away from us this water. And Andrew came forth out of
the prison; and the water ran this way and that from the feet of the blessed Andrew. Then
all the multitude seeing him, all cried out: Have pity upon us.</p>
<p>And the old man having come who gave up his children that they should slay them instead
of him, prayed at the feet of the blessed Andrew, saying: Have pity upon me. And
the holy Andrew answered and said to the old man: I wonder how thou sayest, Have pity
upon me; for thou hadst no pity upon thy children, but gavest them up to be slain instead
of thee. Therefore I say unto thee, At what hour this water goes away, into the abyss shalt
thou go, with the fourteen2275 executioners who slay the men every day. And he came to
the place of the trough, where they used to slay the men. And the blessed one, having looked
up to heaven, prayed before all the multitude; and the earth was opened, and swallowed up
the water, along with the old man. He was carried down into the abyss, with the executioners.
And the men, having seen what had happened, were exceedingly afraid, and began to say:
Woe unto us because this man is from God; and now he will kill us because of the afflictions
which we have caused him. For, behold, what he said to the executioners and the old man
has befallen them. Now, therefore, he will command the fire, and it will burn us. And Andrew,
having heard, said to them: Fear not, children; for I shall not send these also to Hades;
but those have gone, that you may believe in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Then the holy Andrew ordered to be brought up all who had died in the water. And
they were not able to bring them; for there had died a great multitude both of men, and
women, and children, and cattle.</p>
<p>Then Andrew prayed, and they all came to life. And after these things he drew a plan
of a church, and he caused the church to be built. And he baptized them, and gave them
the ordinances of our Lord Jesus Christ, saying to them: Stand by these, in order that you
may know the mysteries of our Lord Jesus Christ. And they all prayed him: We pray thee,
stay with us a few days, that we may be filled with thy fountain, because we are newly
planted.2276 And he did not comply with their request, but said to them: I shall go first to
my disciples. And the children followed after, weeping and praying, with the men; and they
cast ashes2277 upon their heads. And he did not comply with them, but said: I shall go to
my disciples, and after that I shall come again to you. And he went his way.</p>
<p>And the Lord Jesus Christ came down, being like a comely little child, and met Andrew,
and said: Andrew, why hast thou come out and left them without fruit, and hast not had
compassion upon the children that followed after thee, and the men entreating thee, Stay
with us a few days? For the cry of them and the weeping has come up to heaven. Now

therefore return, and go into the city, and remain there seven days, until I shall confirm
their souls in the faith; and then thou shalt go away into the country of the barbarians, thou
and thy disciples. And after going into this city, thou shalt proclaim my Gospel, and bring
up the men who are in the abyss. And thou shalt do what I command thee.</p>
<p>Then Andrew turned and went into the city, saying: I thank Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ,
who wishest to save every soul, that Thou hast not allowed me to go forth out of this city in
mine anger. And when he had come into the city, they, seeing him, rejoiced with exceeding
great joy. And he stayed there seven days, teaching and confirming them in the Lord Jesus
Christ. And the seven days having been fulfilled, it came to pass, while the blessed Andrew
was going out, all came together to him, from the child even to the elder, and sent him on

<head>Acts of Peter and Andrew.</head>
<head>From a Bodleian ms.2279</head>
<head>Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Andrew.</head>
<p>It came to pass when Andrew the apostle of Christ went forth from the city of the maneaters,
behold a luminous cloud snatched him up, and carried him away to the mountain
where Peter and Matthew and Alexander were sitting. And when he saw them, they saluted
him with great joy. Then Peter says to him: What has happened to thee, brother Andrew?
Hast thou sown the word of truth in the country of the man-eaters or not? Andrew says to
him: Yes, father Peter, through thy prayers; but the men of that city have done me many
mischiefs, for they dragged me through their street three days, so that my blood stained the
whole street. Peter says to him: Be a man in the Lord, brother Andrew, and come hither,
and rest from thy labour. For if the good husbandman laboriously till the ground, it will
also bear fruit, and straightway all his toil will be turned into joy; but if he toil, and his land
bring forth no fruit, he has double toil.</p>
<p>And while he was thus speaking, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to them in the form of
a child, and said to them: Hail, Peter, bishop of the whole of my Church! hail, Andrew!
My co-heirs, be courageous, and struggle for mankind; for verily I say unto you, you shall
endure toils in this world for mankind. But be bold; I will give you rest in one hour of repose
in the kingdom of my Father. Arise, then, and go into the city of the barbarians, and preach
in it; and I will be with you in the wonders that shall happen in it by your hands. And the
Lord Jesus, after saluting them, went up into the heavens in glory.</p>
<p>And Peter, and Andrew, and Alexander, and Rufus, and Matthias, went into the city of
the barbarians. And after they had come near the city, Andrew answered and said to Peter:
Father Peter, have we again to undergo toils in this city, as in the country of the man-eaters?
Peter says to him: I do not know. But, behold, there is an old man before us sowing in his
field: if we go up to him, let us say to him, Give us bread; and if he give us bread, we may
know that we are not to suffer in this city; but if he say to us, We have no bread, on the
other hand, we shall know that suffering again awaits us. And when they came up to the
old man, Peter says to him: Hail, farmer! And the farmer says to them: Hail you too,
merchants! Peter says to him: Have you bread to give to these children, for we have been
in want? The old man says to them: Wait a little, and look after the oxen, and the plough,
<note type="footnote">2279 [This is thems. frequently referred to in the previous pages. The Greek text of this fragment is given by
Tischendorf in the supplement to Apocalypses Apocr., pp. 161–167.—R.]</note>

<pb n="1594"/>
and the land, that I may go into the city, and get you loaves. Peter says to him: If you provide
hospitality for us, we shall took after the cattle and the field. The old man says: So be it.
Peter says to him: Are the oxen your own? The old man says: No; I have them on hire.
Peter says to him: Go into the city. And the old man went into the city. And Peter arose,
and girded up his cloak and his under-garment, and says to Andrew: It is not right for us
to rest and be idle; above all, when the old man is working for us, having left his own work.
Then Peter took hold of the plough, and sowed the wheat. And Andrew was behind the
oxen, and says to Peter: Father Peter, why dost thou bring toil upon us, especially when we
have work enough already! Then Andrew took the plough out of Peter’s hand, and sowed
the wheat, saying: O seed cast into the ground in the field of the righteous, come up, and
come to the light. Let the young men of the city therefore come forth, whom I found in the
pit of destruction until to-day; for, behold, the apostles of Christ are coming into the city,
pardoning the sins of those who believe in them, and healing every disease, and every sickness.
Pray ye for me, that He may have mercy upon me, and that I may be delivered from
this strait.</p>
<p>And many of the multitude believed in Christ, because of the saying of the woman;2280
and they fell at the feet of the apostles, and adored them. And they laid their hands upon
them. And they healed those in the city that were sick, and gave sight to the blind and,
hearing to the deaf, and drove out the demons. All the multitude glorified the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And there was a certain rich man in the city, by name Onesiphorus. He, having seen
the miracles done by the apostles, says to them: If I believe in your God, can I also do a
miracle like you? Andrew says to him: If thou wilt forsake all that belongs to thee, and thy
wife and thy children, as we also have done, then thou also shalt do miracles. When Onesiphorus
heard this, he was filled with rage, and took his scarf and threw it over Andrew’s
neck, and struck him, and said to him: Thou art a sorcerer. How dost thou force me to
abandon my wife, and my children, and my goods? Then Peter, having turned and seen
him striking Andrew, says to him: Man, stop now striking Andrew. Onesiphorus says to
him: I see that thou art more sensible than he. Do thou then tell me to leave my wife, and
my children, and my goods. What dost thou say? Peter says to him: One thing I say unto
thee: it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into
the kingdom of heaven.2281 When Onesiphorus heard this, he was even more filled with
rage and anger, and took his scarf off the neck of Andrew, and threw it upon the neck of
Peter; and so he dragged him along, saying: Verily thou art a great sorcerer, more than the
other; for a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle. But if thou wilt show me this
<note type="footnote">2280 Something seems to have fallen out here.</note>
<note type="footnote">2281 Matt. xix. 24, etc.</note>

<pb n="1595"/>
miracle, I will believe in thy God; and not only I, but also the whole city. But if not, thou
shalt be grievously punished in the midst of the city. And when Peter heard this, he was
exceedingly grieved, and stood and stretched forth his hands towards heaven, and prayed,
saying: O Lord our God, listen to me at this time; for they will ensnare us from Thine own
words: for no prophet has spoken to set forth this his explanation, and no patriarch that
we might learn the interpretation of it; and now we seek for ourselves the explanation with
boldness. Do Thou then, Lord, not overlook us: for thou art He who is praised by the
cherubim.</p>
<p>And after he had said this, the Saviour appeared in the form of a child of twelve years
old, wearing a linen garment; and He says to them: Be courageous, and tremble not, my
chosen disciples; for I am with you always. Let the needle and the camel be brought. And
after saying this, He went up into the heavens. And there was a certain merchant2282 in the
city who had believed in the Lord through the Apostle Philip; and when he heard of this,
he ran and searched for a needle with a big eye, to do a favour to the apostles. When Peter
learned this, he said: My son, do not search for a big needle; for nothing is impossible with
God: rather bring us a small needle. And after the needle had been brought, and all the
multitude of the city were standing by to see, Peter looked up and saw a camel coming. And
he ordered her to be brought. Then he fixed the needle in the ground, and cried out with
a loud voice, saying: In the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
I order thee, O camel, to go through the eye of the needle. Then the eye of the needle was
opened like a gate, and the camel went through it, and all the multitude saw it. Again Peter
says to the camel: Go again through the needle. And the camel went a second time. When
Onesiphorus saw this, he said to Peter; Truly thou art a great sorcerer; but I do not believe
unless I send and bring a camel and a needle. And he called one of his servants, and said
to him privately: Go and bring me here a camel and a needle; find also a polluted woman,
and force her to come here: for these men are sorcerers. And Peter having learned the
mystery through the Spirit, says to Onesiphorus: Send and bring the camel, and the woman,
and the needle. And when they brought them, Peter took the needle, and fixed it in the
ground. And the woman was sitting on the camel. Then Peter says: In the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ the crucified, I order thee, O camel, to go through this needle. And immediately
the eye of the needle was opened, and became like a gate, and the camel went through
it. Peter again says to the camel: Go through it again, that all may see the glory of our Lord
Jesus Christ, in order that some may believe on Him. Then the camel again went through
the needle. And Onesiphorus seeing it, cried out, and said: Truly great is the God of Peter
and Andrew, and I from this time forth believe in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now
then, hear my words, O Peter. I have corn lands, vineyards, and fields; I have also twenty-

<pb n="1596"/>
seven pounds of gold, and fifty pounds of silver; and I have very many slaves. I give my
possessions to the poor, that I also may do one miracle like you. And Peter was grieved lest
the powers should not work in him, seeing that he had not received the seal in Christ. And
while he was considering this, behold, a voice out of the heaven saying to him: Do to him
what he wishes, because I will accomplish for him what he desires. Peter says to him: My
son, come hither; do as we do. And Onesiphorus came up, and stood before the camel and
the needle, and said: In the n… (Here the ms. ends.)</p>

<head>Acts and Martyrdom of St. Matthew the Apostle.</head>
<p>About that time Matthew, the holy apostle and evangelist of Christ, was abiding in the
mountain resting, and praying in his tunic and apostolic robes without sandals; and, behold,
Jesus came to Matthew in the likeness of the infants who sing in paradise, and said to him:
Peace to thee, Matthew! And Matthew having gazed upon Him, and not known who He
was, said: Grace to thee, and peace, O child highly favoured! And why hast thou come
hither to me, having left those who sing in paradise, and the delights there? Because here
the place is desert; and what sort of a table I shall lay for thee, O child, I know not, because
I have no bread nor oil in a jar. Moreover, even the winds are at rest, so as not to cast down
from the trees to the ground anything for food; because, for the accomplishing of my fast
of forty days, I, partaking only of the fruits falling by the movement of the winds, am glorifying
my Jesus. Now, therefore, what shall I bring thee, beautiful boy? There is not even
water near, that I may wash thy feet.</p>
<p>And the child said: Why sayest thou, O Matthew? Understand and know that good
discourse is better than a calf, and words of meekness better than every herb of the field,
and a sweet saying as the perfume of love, and cheerfulness of countenance better than
feeding, and a pleasant look is as the appearance of sweetness. Understand, Matthew, and
know that I am paradise, that I am the comforter, I am the power of the powers above, I the
strength of those that restrain themselves, I the crown of the virgins, I the self-control of
the once married, I the boast of the widowed, I the defence of the infants, I the foundation
of the Church, I the kingdom of the bishops, I the glory of the presbyters, I the praise of the
deacons. Be a man, and be strong, Matthew, in, these words.</p>
<p>And Matthew said: The sight of thee hast altogether delighted me, O child; moreover
also, thy words are full of life. For assuredly thy face shines more than the lightning, and
thy words are altogether most sweet. And that indeed I saw thee in paradise when thou
didst sing with the other infants who were killed in Bethlehem, I know right well; but how
thou hast suddenly come hither, this altogether astonishes me. But I shall ask thee one
thing, O child: that impious Herod, where is he? The child says to him: Since thou hast
asked, hear his dwelling-place. He dwells, indeed, in Hades; and there has been prepared
for him fire unquenchable, Gehenna without end, bubbling mire, worm that sleeps not,2283
because he cut off three2284 thousand infants, wishing to slay the child Jesus, the ancient of
the ages; but of all these ages I am father. Now therefore, O Matthew, take this rod of mine,
and go down from the mountain, and go into Myrna, the city of the man-eaters, and plant
<note type="footnote">2283 Or, that dies not.</note>
<note type="footnote">2284 The other [Vienna] ms. has, eleven.</note>

<pb n="1598"/>
it by the gate of the church which thou2285 and Andrew founded; and as soon as thou hast
planted it, it shall be a tree, great and lofty and with many branches, and its branches shall
extend to thirty cubits, and of each single branch the fruit shall be different both to the sight
and the eating,2286 and from the top of the tree shall flow down much honey; and from its
root there shall come forth a great fountain, giving drink to this country round about, and
in it creatures that swim and creep; and in it the man-eaters shall wash themselves, and eat
of the fruit of the trees of the vine and of the honey; and their bodies shall be changed, and
their forms shall be altered so as to be like those of other men; and they shall be ashamed
of the nakedness of their body, and they shall put on clothing of the rams of the sheep, and
they shall no longer eat unclean things; and there shall be to them fire in superabundance,
preparing the sacrifices for offerings, and they shall bake their bread with fire; and they shall
see each other in the likeness of the rest of men, and they shall acknowledge me, and glorify
my Father who is in the heavens. Now therefore make haste, Matthew, and go down hence,
because the departure from thy body through fire is at hand, and the crown of thy endurance.</p>
<p>And the child having said this, and given him the rod, was taken up into the heavens.
And Matthew went down from the mountain, hastening to the city. And as he was about
to enter into the city, there met him Fulvana the wife of the king, and his son Fulvanus and
his wife Erva, who were possessed by an unclean spirit, and cried out shouting: Who has
brought thee here again, Matthew? or who has given thee the rod for our destruction? for
we see also the child Jesus, the Son of God, who is with thee. Do not go then, O Matthew,
to plant the rod for the food, and for the transformation of the man-eaters: for I have found
what I shall do to thee. For since thou didst drive me out of this city, and prevent me from
fulfilling my wishes among the man-eaters, behold, I will raise up against thee the king of
this city, and he will burn thee alive. And Matthew, having laid his hands on each one of
the demoniacs, put the demons to flight, and made the people whole; and they followed
him.</p>
<p>And thus the affair being made manifest, Plato the bishop, having heard of the presence
of the holy Apostle Matthew, met him with all the clergy; and having fallen to the ground,
they kissed his feet. And Matthew raised them, and went with them into the church, and
the child Jesus was also with him. And Matthew, having come to the gate of the church,
stood upon a certain lofty and immoveable stone; and when the whole city ran together,
especially the brethren who had believed, began to say: Men and women who appear in
our sight, heretofore believing in the universe,2287 but now knowing Him who has upheld
<note type="footnote">2285 In some of themss. of the previous book the name of Matthew appears in place of that of Matthias—Matthaios
for Mattheias.</note>

<note type="footnote">2287 The other [Vienna] ms. has: heretofore worshipping every evil thing.</note>

<pb n="1599"/>
and made the universe; until now worshipping the Satyr, and mocked by ten thousand false
gods, but now through Jesus Christ acknowledging the one and only God, Lord, Judge; who
have laid aside the immeasurable greatness of evil, and put on love, which is of like nature
with affectionateness, towards men; once strangers to Christ, but now confessing Him Lord
and God; formerly without form, but now transformed through Christ;—behold, the staff
which you see in my hand, which Jesus, in whom you have believed and will believe, gave
me; perceive now what comes to pass through me, and acknowledge the riches of the
greatness which He will this day make for you. For, behold, I shall plant this rod in this
place, and it shall be a sign to your generations, and it shall become a tree, great and lofty
and flourishing, and its fruit beautiful to the view and good to the sight; and the fragrance
of perfumes shall come forth from it, and there shall be a vine twining round it, full of
clusters; and from the top of it honey coming down, and every flying creature shall find
covert in its branches; and a fountain of water shall come forth from the root of it, having
swimming and creeping things, giving drink to all the country round about.</p>
<p>And having said this, and called upon the name of the Lord Jesus, he fixed his rod in
the ground, and straightway it sprung up to one cubit; and the sight was strange and wonderful.
For the rod having straightway shot up, increased in size, and grew into a great tree,
as Matthew had said. And the apostle said: Go into the fountain and wash your bodies in
it, and then thus partake both of the fruits of the tree, and of the vine and the honey, and
drink of the fountain, and you shall be transformed in your likeness to that of men; and
after that, having gone into the church, you will clearly recognise that you have believed in
the living and true God. And having done all these things, they saw themselves changed
into the likeness of Matthew; then, having thus gone into the church, they worshipped and
glorified God. And when they had been changed, they knew that they were naked; and they
ran in haste each to his own house to cover their nakedness, because they were ashamed.
And Matthew and Plato remained in the church spending the night, and glorifying
God. And there remained also the king’s wife, and his son and his wife, and they prayed
the apostle to give them the seal in Christ. And Matthew gave orders to Plato; and he, having
gone forth, baptized them in the water of the fountain of the tree, in the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And so thereafter, having gone into the church, they
communicated in the holy mysteries of Christ;2288 and they exulted and passed the night,
they also along with the apostle, many others having also come with them; and all in the
church sang the whole night, glorifying God.</p>
<p>And when the dawn had fully come, the blessed Matthew, having gone along with the
bishop Plato, stood in the place in which the rod had been planted, and he sees the rod
grown into a great tree, and near it a vine twined round it, and honey coming down from
<note type="footnote">2288 The other [Paris]ms. has: having communicated in the Eucharist.</note>

<pb n="1600"/>
above even to its root; and that tree was at once beautiful and flourishing, like the plants in
paradise, and a river proceeded from its root watering2289 all the land of the city of
Myrna.2290 And all ran together, and ate of the fruit of the tree and the vine, just as any one
wished.</p>
<p>And when what had come to pass was reported in the palace, the king Fulvanus, having
learned what had been done by Matthew about his wife, and his son, and his daughter-inlaw,
rejoiced for a time at their purification; but seeing that they were inseparable from
Matthew, he was seized with rage and anger, and endeavoured to put him to death by fire.
And on that night2291 in which the king intended to lay hands on Matthew, Matthew saw
Jesus saying to him: I am with thee always to save thee, Matthew; be strong, and be a man.</p>
<p>And the blessed Matthew, having awoke, and sealed himself over all the body, rose up
at dawn, and proceeded into the church; and having bent his knees, prayed earnestly. Then
the bishop having come, and the clergy, they stood in common in prayer, glorifying God.
And after they had ended the prayer, the bishop Plato said: Peace to thee, Matthew, apostle
of Christ! And the blessed Matthew said to him: Peace to you! And when they had sat
down, the apostle said to the bishop Plato, and to all the clergy: I wish you, children, to
know, Jesus having declared it to me, that the king of this city is going to send soldiers against
me, the devil having entered into him, and manifestly armed him against us. But let us give
ourselves up to Jesus, and He will deliver us from every trial, and all who have believed in
Him.</p>
<p>And the king, plotting against the blessed Matthew how he should lay hands on him,
and seeing also that the believers were very many, was very much at fault, and was in great
difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore the wicked and unclean devil who had come forth from the king’s wife, and
his son, and his daughter-in-law, put to flight by Matthew, having transformed himself into
the likeness of a soldier, stood before the king, and said to him: O king, why art thou thus
put to the worse by this stranger and sorcerer? Knowest thou not that he was a publican,
but now he has been called an apostle2292 by Jesus, who was crucified by the Jews? For,
behold, thy wife, and thy son, and thy daughter-in-law, instructed by him, have believed in
him, and along with him sing in the church. And now, behold, Matthew is going forth, and
Plato with him, and they are going to the gate called Heavy; but make haste, and thou wilt
find them, and thou shalt do to him all that may be pleasing in thine eyes.</p>

<pb n="1601"/>
<p>The king having heard this, and being the more exasperated by the pretended soldier,
sent against the blessed Matthew four soldiers, having threatened them, and said: Unless
you bring Matthew to me, I shall burn you alive with fire; and the punishment which he is
to undergo, you shall endure. And the soldiers, having been thus threatened by the king,
go in arms to where the Apostle Matthew and the bishop Plato are. And when they came
near them, they heard their speaking indeed, but saw no one. And having come, they said
to the king: We pray thee, O king, we went and found no one, but only heard the voices of
persons talking. And the king, being enraged, and having blazed up like fire, gave orders
to send other ten soldiers—man-eaters—saying to them: Go stealthily to the place, and tear
them in pieces alive, and eat up Matthew, and Plato, who is with him. And when they were
about to come near the blessed Matthew, the Lord Jesus Christ, having come in the likeness
of a most beautiful boy, holding a torch of fire, ran to meet them, burning out their eyes.
And they, having cried out and thrown their arms from them, fled, and came to the king,
being speechless.</p>
<p>And the demon who had before appeared to the king in the form of a soldier, being
again transformed into the form of a soldier, stood before the king, and said to him: Thou
seest, O king, this stranger has bewitched them all. Learn, then, how thou shalt take him.
The king says to him: Tell me first wherein his strength is, that I may know, and then I will
draw up against him with a great force. And the demon, compelled by an angel, says to the
king: Since thou wishest to hear accurately about him, O king, I will tell thee all the truth.
Really, unless he shall be willing to be taken by thee of his own accord, thou labourest in
vain, and thou wilt not be able to hurt him; but if thou wishest to lay hands on him, thou
wilt be struck by him with blindness, and thou wilt be paralyzed. And if thou send a multitude
of soldiers against him, they also will be struck with blindness, and will be paralyzed.
And we shall go, even seven unclean demons, and immediately make away with thee and
thy whole camp, and destroy all the city with lightning, except those naming that awful and
holy name of Christ; for wherever a footstep of theirs has come, thence, pursued, we flee.
And even if thou shalt apply fire to him, to him the fire will be dew; and if thou shalt shut
him up in a furnace, to him the furnace will be a church; and if thou shalt put him in chains
in prison, and seal up the floors, the doors will open to him of their own accord, and all who
believe in that name will go in, even they, and say, This prison is a church of the living God,
and a holy habitation of those that live alone.2293 Behold, O king, I have told thee all the
truth. The king therefore says to the pretended soldier: Since I do not know Matthew, come
with me, and point him out to me from a distance, and take from me gold, as much as thou
mayst wish, or go thyself, and with thy sword kill him, and Plato his associate.2294 The demon
<note type="footnote">2293 i.e., monks.</note>
<note type="footnote">2294 Lit., of the same form with him.</note>

<pb n="1602"/>
says to him: I cannot kill him. I dare not even look into his face, seeing that he has destroyed
all our generation through the name of Christ, proclaimed through him.</p>
<p>The king says to him: And who art thou? And he says: I am the demon who dwelt in
thy wife, and in thy son, and in thy daughter-in-law; and my name is Asmodæus; and this
Matthew drove me out of them. And now, behold, thy wife, and thy son, and thy daughterin-
law sing along with him in the church. And I know, O king, that thou also after this wilt
believe in him. The king says to him: Whoever thou art, spirit of many shapes, I adjure
thee by the God whom he whom thou callest Matthew proclaims, depart hence without
doing hurt to any one. And straightway the demon, no longer like a soldier, but like smoke,
became invisible; and as he fled he cried out: O secret name, armed against us, I pray thee,
Matthew, servant of the holy God, pardon me, and I will no longer remain in this city. Keep
thou thine own; but I go away into the fire everlasting.</p>
<p>Then the king, affected with great fear at the answer of the demon, remained quiet that
day. And the night having come, and he not being able to sleep because he was hungry,2295
leaped up at dawn, and went into the church, with only two soldiers without arms, to take
Matthew by craft, that he might kill him. And having summoned two friends of Matthew,
he said to them: Show to Matthew, says he, that I wish to be his disciple. And Matthew
hearing, and knowing the craft of the tyrant, and having been warned also by the vision of
the Lord to him, went forth out of the church, led by the hand by Plato, and stood in the
gate of the church.</p>
<p>And they say to the king: Behold Matthew in the gate! And he says: Who he is, or
where he is, I see not. And they said to him: Behold, he is in sight of thee. And he says:
All the while I see nobody. For he had been blinded by the power of God. And he began
to cry out: Woe to me, miserable! what evil has come upon me, for my eyes have been
blinded, and all my limbs paralyzed? O Asmodæus Beelzebul Satan! all that thou hast said
to me has come upon me. But I pray thee, Matthew, servant of God, forgive me as the herald
of the good God; for assuredly the Jesus proclaimed by thee three days ago through the night
appeared to me altogether resplendent as with lightning, like a beautiful young man, and
said to me, Since thou art entertaining evil counsels in the wickedness of thine heart in regard
to my servant Matthew, know I have disclosed to him that through thee will be the release
of his body. And straightway I saw him going up into heaven. If therefore he is thy God,
and if he wishes thy body to be buried in our city for a testimony of the salvation of the
generations after this, and for the banishing2296 of the demons, I shall know the truth for
myself by this, by thee laying on hands upon me, and I shall receive my sight. And the

apostle having laid his hands upon his eyes, and saying Ephphatha, Jesus,2297 he made him
receive his sight instantly.</p>
<p>And straightway the king, laying hold of the apostle, and leading him by the right hand,
brought him by craft into the palace; and Plato was on Matthew’s left hand, going along
with him, and keeping hold of him.2298 Then Matthew says: O crafty tyrant, how long dost
thou not fulfil the works of thy father the devil? And he was enraged at what had been said;
for he perceived that he would inflict upon him a more bitter death. For he resolved to put
him to death by fire. And he commanded several executioners to come, and to lead him
away to the place by the seashore, where the execution of malefactors was wont to take place,
saying to the executioners: I hear, says he, that the God whom he proclaims delivers from
fire those who believe in him. Having laid him, therefore, on the ground on his back, and
stretched him out, pierce his hands and feet with iron nails, and cover him over with paper,
having smeared it with dolphins’ oil, and cover him up with brimstone and asphalt and
pitch, and put tow and brushwood above. Thus apply the fire to him; and if any of the same
tribe with him rise up against you, he shall get the same punishment.</p>
<p>And the apostle exhorted the brethren to remain undismayed, and that they should rejoice,
and accompany him with great meekness, singing and praising God, because they
were deemed worthy to have the relics of the apostle. Having therefore come to the place,
the executioners, like most evil wild beasts, pinned down to the ground Matthew’s hands
and feet with long nails; and having done everything as they had been bid, applied the fire.
And they indeed laboured2299 closely, kindling it all round; but all the fire was changed into
dew, so that the brethren, rejoicing, cried out: The only God is the Christians’, who assists
Matthew, in whom also we have believed: the only God is the Christians’, who preserves
His own apostle in the fire. And by the voice the city was shaken. And some of the executioners,
having gone forth, said to the king: We indeed, O king, by every contrivance of
vengeance, have kindled the fire; but the sorcerer by a certain name puts it out, calling upon
Christ, and invoking his cross; and the Christians surrounding him play with the fire, and
walking in it with naked feet, laugh at us,2300 and we have fled ashamed.</p>
<p>Then he ordered a multitude to carry coals of fire from the furnace of the bath in the
palace, and the twelve gods of gold and silver; and place them, says he, in a circle round the
sorcerer, lest he may even somehow bewitch the fire from the furnace of the palace. And
there being many executioners and soldiers, some carried the coals; and others, bearing the

gods, brought them. And the king accompanied them, watching lest any of the Christians
should steal one of his gods, or bewitch the fire. And when they came near the place where
the apostle was nailed down, his face was looking towards heaven, and all his body was
covered over with the paper, and much brushwood over his body to the height of ten cubits.
And having ordered the soldiers to set the gods in a circle round Matthew, five cubits off,
securely fastened that they might not fall, again he ordered the coal to be thrown on, and
to kindle the fire at all points.</p>
<p>And Matthew, having looked up to heaven, cried out, Adonai eloi sabaoth marmari
marmunth; that is, O God the Father, O Lord Jesus Christ, deliver me, and burn down their
gods which they worship; and let the fire also pursue the king even to his palace, but not to
his destruction: for perhaps he will repent and be converted. And when he saw the fire to
be monstrous in height, the king, thinking that Matthew was burnt up, laughed aloud, and
said: Has thy magic been of any avail to thee, Matthew? Can thy Jesus now give thee any
help?</p>
<p>And as he said this a dreadful wonder appeared; for all the fire along with the wood
went away from Matthew, and was poured round about their gods, so that nothing of the
gold or the silver was any more seen; and the king fled, and said: Woe’s me, that my gods
are destroyed by the rebuke of Matthew, of which the weight was a thousand talents of gold
and a thousand talents of silver. Better are the gods of stone and of earthenware, in that
they are neither melted nor stolen.2301</p>
<p>And when the fire had thus utterly destroyed their gods, and burnt up many soldiers,
there came to pass again another stranger wonder. For the fire, in the likeness of a great
and dreadful dragon, chased the tyrant as far as the palace, and ran hither and thither round
the king, not letting him go into the palace. And the king, chased by the fire, and not allowed
to go into his palace, turned back to where Matthew was, and cried out, saying: I beseech
thee, whoever thou art, O man, whether magician or sorcerer or god, or angel of God, whom
so great a pyre has not touched, remove from me this dreadful and fiery dragon; forget the
evil I have done, as also when thou madest me receive my sight. And Matthew, having rebuked
the fire, and the flames having been extinguished, and the dragon having become
invisible, stretching his eyes to heaven, and praying in Hebrew, and commending his spirit
to the Lord, said: Peace to you! And having glorified the Lord, he went to his rest about
the sixth hour.</p>
<p>Then the king, having ordered more soldiers to come, and the bed to be brought from
the palace, which had a great show of gold, he ordered the apostle to be laid on it, and carried
to the palace. And the body of the apostle was lying as if in sleep, and his robe and his tunic
<note type="footnote">2301 The other [Vienna] ms. adds: How my forefathers toiled, and with great trouble made the gods; and
now, behold, they have been destroyed by one magician.</note>

unstained by the fire; and sometimes they saw him on the bed, and sometimes following,
and sometimes going before the bed, and with his right hand put upon Plato’s head, and
singing along with the multitude, so that both the king and the soldiers, with the crowd,
were struck with astonishment. And many diseased persons and demoniacs, having only
touched the bed, were made sound; and as many as were savage in appearance, in that same
hour were changed into the likeness of other men.</p>
<p>And as the bed was going into the palace, we2302 all saw Matthew rising up, as it were,
from the bed, and going into heaven, led by the hand by a beautiful boy; and twelve men in
shining garments came to meet him, having never-fading and golden crowns on their head;
and we saw how that child crowned Matthew, so as to be like them, and in a flash of lightning
they went away to heaven.</p>
<p>And the king stood at the gate of the palace, and ordered that no one should come in
but the soldiers carrying the bed. And having shut the doors,2303 he ordered an iron coffin
to be made, put the body of Matthew into it, and sealed it up with lead; through the eastern
gate of the palace at midnight put it into a boat, no one knowing of it, and threw it into the
deep part of the sea.</p>
<p>And through the whole night the brethren remained before the gate of the palace,
spending the night, and singing; and when the dawn rose there was a voice: O bishop Plato,
carry the Gospel and the Psalter of David; go along with the multitude of the brethren to
the east of the palace, and sing the Alleluia, and read the Gospel, and bring as an offering
the holy bread; and having pressed three clusters from the vine into a cup, communicate
with me, as the Lord Jesus showed us how to offer up when He rose from the dead on the
third day.</p>
<p>And the bishop having run into the church, and taken the Gospel and the Psalter of
David, and having assembled the presbyters and the multitude of the brethren, came to the
east of the palace at the hour of sunrise; and having ordered the one who was singing to go
upon a certain lofty stone, he began to praise in singing of a song to God: Precious in the
sight of God is the death of His saints.2304 And again: I laid me down and slept; I arose:
because the Lord will sustain me.2305 And they listened to the singing of a song of David:
Shall he that is dead not rise again? Now I shall raise him up for myself, saith the Lord.</p>
<note type="footnote">2302 The change of person is noticable.</note>
<note type="footnote">2303 In the otherms. the king prays: And now, since there is still in me a little unbelief, I beseech thee that
thou wilt bring the body of Matthew from the sea. For, behold, I will order the body to be thrown into the depths
of the sea; and if thou deliver it as thou didst deliver it, in the funeral pile, I will forsake all my gods at once, and
believe in thee alone. [The Viennams., here cited, interpolates still more.—R.]</note>

<p>And all shouted out the Alleluia. And the bishop read the Gospel, and all cried out: Glory
to Thee, Thou who hast been glorified in heaven and on earth. And so then they offered
the gift of the holy offering for Matthew; and having partaken for thanksgiving2306 of the
undefiled and life-giving mysteries of Christ, they all glorified God.</p>
<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and Plato sees the sea opposite about seven furlongs
off; and, behold, Matthew was standing on the sea, and two men, one on each side, in shining
garments, and the beautiful boy in front of them. And all the brethren saw these things,
and they heard them saying Amen, Alleluia. And one could see the sea fixed like a stone of
crystal, and the beautiful boy in front of them, when out of the depth of the sea a cross came
up, and at the end of the cross the coffin going up in which was the body of Matthew; and
in the hour of the piercing on the cross,2307 the boy placed the coffin on the ground, behind
the palace towards the east, where the bishop had offered the offering for Matthew.</p>
<p>And the king having seen these things from the upper part of the house, and being terrorstruck,
went forth from the palace, and ran and worshipped towards the east at the coffin,
and fell down before the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons, in repentance and
confession, saying:2308 Truly I believe in the true God, Christ Jesus. I entreat, give me the
seal in Christ, and I will give you my palace, in testimony of Matthew, and you shall put the
coffin upon my golden bed, in the great dining-room; only, having baptized me in it, communicate
to me the Eucharist of Christ. And the bishop having prayed, and ordered him
to take off his clothes, and having examined him for a long time, and he having confessed
and wept over what he had done, having sealed him, and anointed him with oil, put him
down into the sea, in the name of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. And when he came up
from the water he ordered him to put on himself splendid garments, and so then having
given praise and thanks, communicating the holy bread and mixed cup, the bishop first
gave them to the king, saying: Let this body of Christ, and this cup, His blood shed for us,

asked: What is the uproar and shouting among the people? And he learned that Matthew’s coffin had come of

voice: The God of Matthew is the only God, and there is none other but Him. And he fell on his face near the
coffin, saying: Pardon me, Lord Jesus Christ, for what I have done against this holy man, for I was in ignorance.
And the bishop, seeing the repentance and tears of the king, gave him a hand, and raised him from the ground,
and said to him: Rise up, and be of good courage; for the Lord God hath accepted thy repentance and conversion
through the good offices of His servant and apostle Thomas. And the king rose up from the ground, and fell at
the bishop’s feet, etc.—as in the text.</note>

be to thee for the remission of sins unto life. And a voice was heard from on high: Amen,
amen, amen. And when he had thus communicated in fear and joy, the apostle appeared
and said: King Fulvanus, thy name shall no longer be Fulvanus; but thou shalt be called
Matthew. And thou, the son of the king, shall no longer be called Fulvanus, but Matthew
also; and thou Ziphagia, the wife of the king, shall be called Sophia;2309 and Erva, the wife
of your son, shall be called Synesis.2310 And these names of yours shall be written in the
heavens, and there shall not fail of your loins from generation to generation. And in that
same hour Matthew appointed the king a presbyter, and he was thirty-seven years old; and
the king’s son he appointed deacon, being seventeen years old; and the king’s wife he appointed
a presbyteress; and his son’s wife he appointed a deaconess,2311 and she also was seventeen
years old. And then he thus blessed them, saying: The blessing and the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ shall be with you to time everlasting.</p>
<p>Then the king, having awakened out of sleep, and rejoiced with all his house at the vision
of the holy Apostle Matthew, praised God.</p>
<p>And the king, having gone into his palace, broke all the idols to pieces, and gave a decree
to those in his kingdom, writing thus: King Matthew, to all those under my kingdom,
greeting. Christ having appeared upon earth, and having saved the human race, the socalled
gods have been found to be deceivers, and soul-destroyers, and plotters against the
human race. Whence, divine grace having shone abroad, and come even to us, and we
having come to the knowledge of the deception of the idols, that it is vain and false, it has
seemed good to our divinity that there should not be many gods, but one, and one only, the
God in the heavens. And you, having received this our decree, keep to the purport of it,
and break to pieces and destroy every idol; and if any one shall be detected from this time
forth serving idols, or concealing them, let such an one be subjected to punishment by the
sword. Farewell all, because we also are well.</p>
<p>And when this order was given out, all, rejoicing and exulting, broke their idols to pieces,
crying out and saying: There is one only God, He who is in the heavens, who does good to
men.</p>
<p>And after all these things had come to pass, Matthew the apostle of Christ appeared to
the bishop Plato, and said to him: Plato, servant of God, and our brother, be it known unto
thee, that after three years shall be thy rest in the Lord, and exultation to ages of ages. And
the king himself, whom after my own name I have called Matthew, shall receive the throne
of thy bishopric, and after him his son. And he, having said Peace to thee and all the saints,
went to heaven.

And after three years the bishop Plato rested in the Lord. And King Matthew succeeded
him, having given up his kingdom willingly to another, whence there was given him grace
against unclean demons, and he cured every affliction. And he advanced his son to be a
presbyter, and made him second to himself.</p>
<p>And Saint Matthew finished his course in the country of the man-eaters, in the city of

<head>Acts of the Holy Apostle Thomas.</head>
<p>At that time we the apostles were all in Jerusalem—Simon called Peter, and Andrew his
brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas,
and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James of Alphæus and Simon the Cananæan; and Judas of
James;2313—and we portioned out the regions of the world, in order that each one of us
might go into the region that fell to him, and to the nation to which the Lord sent him. By
lot, then, India fell to Judas Thomas,2314 also called Didymus. And he did not wish to go,
saying that he was not able to go on account of the weakness of the flesh; and how can I,
being an Hebrew man, go among the Indians to proclaim the truth? And while he was thus
reasoning and speaking, the Saviour appeared to him through the night, and said to him:
Fear not, Thomas; go away to India, and proclaim the word; for my grace shall be with thee.
But he did not obey, saying: Wherever Thou wishest to send me, send me elsewhere; for to
the Indians I am not going.</p>
<p>And as he was thus speaking and growing angry, there happened to be there a certain
merchant come from India, by name Abbanes, sent from the king Gundaphoros, and having
received an order from him to buy a carpenter and bring him to him. And the Lord, having
seen him walking about in the market at noon, said to him: Dost thou wish to buy a carpenter?
And he said to Him: Yes. And the Lord said to him: I have a slave a carpenter,
and I wish to sell him. And having said this, He showed him Thomas at a distance, and
agreed with him for three pounds of uncoined silver; and He wrote a bill of sale, saying: I
Jesus, the son of Joseph the carpenter, declare that I have sold my slave, Judas by name, to
thee Abbanes, a merchant of Gundaphoros, the king of the Indians. And the purchase2315
being completed, the Saviour taking Judas, who also is Thomas, led him to Abbanes the
merchant; and Abbanes seeing him, said to him: Is this thy master? And the apostle answered
and said: Yes, He is my Lord. And he says: I have bought thee from him. And the apostle
held his peace.</p>
<p>And at dawn of the following day, the apostle having prayed and entreated the Lord,
said: I go wherever Thou wishest, O Lord Jesus; Thy will be done. And he went to Abbanes
the merchant, carrying nothing at all with him, but only his price. For the Lord had given
it to him, saying: Let thy worth also be with thee along with my grace, wherever thou mayst
go. And the apostle came up with Abbanes, who was carrying his effects into the boat. He

began therefore also to carry them along with him. And when they had gone on board and
sat down, Abbanes questioned the apostle, saying: What kind of work dost thou know?
And he said: In wood, ploughs, and yokes, and balances,2316 and boats, and boats’ oars,
and masts, and blocks; in stone, slabs,2317 and temples, and royal palaces. And Abbanes
the merchant said to him: Of such a workman, to be sure, we have need. They began,
therefore, to sail away. And they had a fair wind, and they sailed fast until they came to
Andrapolis, a royal city.</p>
<p>And having gone out of the boat, they went into the city. And, behold, the voices of
flute-players, and of water-organs, and trumpets, sounding round them; and the apostle
inquired, saying: What festival is this in this city? And those who were there said to him:
The gods have brought thee also, that thou mayst be feasted in this city. For the king has
an only-begotten daughter, and he is now giving her to a husband in marriage: this festival,
then, which thou seest to-day, is the rejoicing and public assembly for the marriage. And
the king has sent forth heralds to proclaim everywhere that all are to come to the marriage,
rich and poor, bond and free, strangers and citizens. And if any one shall refuse and not
come to the marriage, he will be answerable to the king.2318 And Abbanes having heard,
said to the apostle: Let us also go, then, that we may not offend the king, and especially as
we are strangers. And he said: Let us go. And having turned into the inn, and rested a little,
they went to the marriage. And the apostle seeing them all reclining, reclined he also in the
midst. And they all looked at him as a stranger, and coming from a foreign land. And Abbanes
the merchant, as being a lord, reclined in another place.</p>
<p>And when they had dined and drunk, the apostle tasted nothing. Those, then, about
him said to him: Why hast thou come hither, neither eating nor drinking? And he answered
and said to them: For something greater than food or even drink have I come hither, even
that I might accomplish the will of the King. For the heralds proclaim the wishes of the
King, and whoever will not hear the heralds will be liable to the judgment of the King.
When, therefore, they had dined and drunk, and crowns and perfumes had been brought,
each took perfume, and one anointed his face, another his cheek,2319 and one one part of
his body, and another another. And the apostle anointed the crown of his head, and put a
little of the ointment in his nostrils, and dropped it also into his ears, and applied it also to
his teeth, and carefully anointed the parts round about his heart; and having taken the crown
that was brought to him wreathed of myrtle and other flowers, he put it on his head, and
took a branch of reed in his hand, and held it.</p>

<p>And the flute-girl, holding the flutes in her hand, went round them all; and when she
came to the place where the apostle was, she stood over him, playing the flute over his head
a long time. And that flute-girl was Hebrew by race.</p>
<p>And as the apostle looked away to the ground, a certain one of the wine-pourers2320
stretched forth his hand and struck him. And the apostle, having raised his eyes, and regarded
him who had struck him, said: My God will forgive thee this wrong in the world to come,
but in this world He will show His wonders, and I shall soon see that hand that struck me
dragged along by a dog. And having thus spoken, he began to sing and to repeat this song:—</p>
<p>Maiden, daughter of the light, in whom there exists and abides the majestic splendour
of kings; and delightsome is the sight of her, resplendent with brilliant beauty. Her garments
are like spring flowers, and the odour of a sweet smell is given forth from them; and on the
crown of her head the king is seated, feeding with his own ambrosia those who are seated
beside him; and truth rests upon her head, and she shows forth joy with her feet; and becomingly
does she open her mouth; thirty-and-two are they who sing her praises, and their
tongue is like a curtain of the door which is drawn for them who go in; and her neck is made
in the likeness of the stairs which the first Creator created; and her two hands signify and
represent the choral dance of the blessed ages, proclaiming it; and her fingers represent the
gates of the city. Her chamber lighted up breathes forth scent from balsam and every perfume,
and gives forth a sweet odour of myrrh and savoury herbs; and within are strewn
myrtles and sweet-smelling flowers of all kinds; and the bridal chambers are adorned with
calamus.2321 And her groomsmen, of whom the number is seven, whom she has chosen
for herself, surround her like a wall; and her bridesmaids are seven, who dance before her;
and twelve are they in number who minister before her and are at her bidding, having their
gaze and their sight upon the bridegroom, that through the sight of him they may be enlightened.
And they shall be with him to everlasting in that everlasting joy, and they shall
sit down in that wedding to which the great ones are gathered together, and they shall abide
in the festivities of which the eternals are deemed worthy; and they shall be arrayed in royal
raiment, and shall put on shining robes; and in joy and exultation both of them shall be,
and they shall glorify the Father of the universe, whose majestic light they have received,
and they have been enlightened by the sight of Him their Lord, whose ambrosial food they
have received, of which there is no failing at all; and they have drunk also of the wine which
brings to them no thirst, neither desire of the flesh; and they have with the living spirit
glorified and praised the father of truth and the mother of wisdom.</p>
<p>And when he had sung and finished this song, all who were there present looked upon
him and kept silence, and they also saw his form changed; and what had been said by him

they did not understand, since he was a Hebrew, and what had been said by him had been
said in Hebrew. But the flute-girl alone heard all, for she was Hebrew by race, and standing
off from him she played the flute to the others; but at him she mostly turned her eyes and
looked, for she altogether loved him as a man of the same nation with herself, and he was
also beautiful in appearance above all who were there. And when the flute-girl had come
to the end of all her flute-playing, she sat down opposite him, and looked and gazed upon
him. But he looked at no one at all, neither did he regard any one, but only kept his eyes
on the ground, waiting until he should depart thence. And that wine-pourer that struck
him came down to the fountain to draw water; and there happened to be a lion there, and
it came forth and killed him, and left him lying in the place, after tearing up his limbs; and
dogs immediately seized his limbs, among which also one black dog, laying hold of his right
hand in his mouth, brought it to the place of the banquet.</p>
<p>And all seeing were terror-struck, inquiring which of them had been taken off. And
when it was clear that it was the hand of the wine-pourer who had struck the apostle, the
flute-girl broke her flutes in pieces, and threw them away, and went and sat down at the feet
of the apostle, saying: This man is either God or God’s apostle; for I heard him saying in
Hebrew to the wine-pourer, I shall soon see the hand that struck me dragged about by dogs,
which also you have now seen; for as he said, so also it has come to pass. And some believed
her, and some not. And the king, having heard, came up and said to him: Rise up, and go
with me, and pray for my daughter; for she is my only child, and today I give her away. And
the apostle would not go with him; for his Lord had not at all been revealed to him there.
And the king took him away against his will to the bridal-chamber, that he might pray for
them.</p>
<p>And the apostle stood, and began to pray and speak thus: My Lord and my God, who
accompanies His servants on their way, guiding and directing those who trust in Him, the
refuge and the repose of the afflicted, the hope of the mourners, and the deliverer of the
captives, the physician of the souls that are lying under disease, and Saviour of every creature,
who gives life to the world, and invigorates our souls! Thou knowest what will come to
pass, who also for our sakes makest these things perfect: Thou, Lord, who revealest hidden
mysteries, and declarest unspeakable words; Thou, Lord, the planter of the good tree, also
through the tree makest words to spring up; Thou, Lord, who art in all, and camest through
all, and existest in all Thy works, and makest Thyself manifest through the working of them
all; Jesus Christ, the Son of compassion, and perfect Saviour; Christ, Son of the living God,
the undaunted Power which has overthrown the enemy; and the voice heard by the rulers,2322
which shook all their powers; the ambassador who was sent to them from on high, and who
wentest down even to Hades; who also, having opened the doors, didst bring out thence

those that had been shut in for many ages by the controller of the world, and didst show
them the way up that leads up on high: I beseech Thee, Lord Jesus Christ, I offer Thee
supplication for these young persons, that Thou mayst make what happens and befalls them
to be for their good. And having laid his hands on them, and said, The Lord will be with
you, he left them in the place, and went away.2323</p>
<p>And the king requested the groomsmen to go out of the bridal-chamber; and all having
gone forth, and the doors having been shut, the bridegroom raised the curtain of the bridalchamber,
that he might bring the bride to himself. And he saw the Lord Jesus talking with
the bride, and having the appearance of Judas Thomas, who shortly before had blessed them,
and gone out from them; and he says to him: Didst thou not go out before them all? And
how art thou found here? And the Lord said to him: I am not Judas, who also is Thomas;
I am his brother. And the Lord sat down on the bed, and ordered them also to sit down on
the seats;2324 and He began to say to them:—</p>
<p>Keep in mind, my children, what my brother said to you, and to whom he commended
you; and this know, that if you refrain from this filthy intercourse, you become temples holy
and pure, being released from afflictions and troubles, known and unknown, and you will
not be involved in the cares of life, and of children, whose end is destruction; but if you get
many children, for their sakes you become grasping and avaricious, plundering orphans,
coveting the property of widows, and by doing this you subject yourselves to most grievous
punishments. For many children become unprofitable, being harassed by demons, some
openly and others secretly: for they become either lunatics, or half-withered, or lame, or
deaf, or dumb, or paralytics, or idiots; and even if they be in good health, they will be again
good-for-nothing, doing unprofitable and abominable works: for they will be detected
either in adultery, or in murder, or in theft, or in fornication, and by all these you will be
afflicted. But if you will be persuaded, and preserve your souls pure to God, there will be
born to you living children, whom these hurtful things do not touch; and you will be without
care, spending an untroubled life, free from grief and care, looking forward to receive that
marriage incorruptible and true; and you will be in it companions of the bridegroom, going
in along with Him into that bridal-chamber full of immortality and light.2325</p>
<p>And when the young people heard this, they believed the Lord, and gave themselves
over into His keeping, and refrained from filthy lust, and remained thus spending the night
in the place. And the Lord went out from before them, having spoken thus to them: The
grace of the Lord shall be with you. And the dawn having come on, the king arrived, and

having supplied the table, brought it in before the bridegroom and the bride; and he found
them sitting opposite each other, and he found the face of the bride uncovered, and the
bridegroom was quite cheerful. And the mother having come to the bride, said: Wherefore
dost thou sit thus, child, and art not ashamed, but thus as if thou hadst for a long time lived
with thine own husband? And her father said: Is it because of thy great love to thy husband
that thou art uncovered?</p>
<p>And the bride answered and said: Truly, father, I am in great love, and I pray to my
Lord to continue to me the love which I have experienced this night, and I shall beg for
myself this husband whom I have experienced today. For this reason, then, I am no longer
covered, since the mirror2326 of shame has been taken away from me, and I am no longer
ashamed nor abashed, since the work of shame and bashfulness has been removed far from
me; and because I am not under any violent emotion, since violent emotion does not abide
in me; and because I am in cheerfulness and joy, since the day of joy has not been disturbed;
and because I hold of no account this husband, and these nuptials that have passed away
from before mine eyes, since I have been joined in a different marriage; and because I have
had no intercourse with a temporary husband, whose end is with lewdness and bitterness
of soul, since I have been united to a true Husband.</p>
<p>And when the bride is saying yet more, the bridegroom answers and says: I thank Thee,
Lord, who hast been proclaimed by the stranger and found by us;2327 who hast put corruption
far from me, and hast sown life in me; who hast delivered me from this disease, hard to heal,
and hard to cure, and abiding for ever, and established in me sound health; who hast shown
Thyself to me, and hast revealed to me all that concerns me, in which I am; who hast redeemed
me from falling, and hast led me to something better, and who hast released me
from things temporary, and hast deemed me worthy of things immortal and ever existing;
who hast brought Thyself down even to me and to my littleness, in order that, having placed
me beside Thy greatness, Thou mightest unite me to Thyself; who hast not withheld Thine
own compassion from me lost, but hast shown me how to search myself, and to know
what2328 I was and what2329 and how I am now, in order that I may again become as I was;
whom I indeed did not know, but Thou Thyself whom I knew not hast sought me out and
taken me to Thyself; whom I have experienced, and am not now able to forget, whose love
is fervent in me; and speak indeed as I ought I cannot. But what I have time to say about
Him is short, and altogether little, and not in proportion to His glory; but He does not find

through the love of Him that I say even this.</p>
<p>And the king, having heard these things from the bridegroom and the bride, rent his
garments, and said to those standing near him: Go out quickly, and go round the whole
city, and seize and bring me that man, the sorcerer, who has come for evil into this city: for
I led him with my own hands into my house, and I told him to pray for my most unfortunate
daughter; and whoever shall find him and bring him to me, whatever service he shall ask of
me, I give him. They went away, therefore, and went round seeking him, and found him
not; for he had sailed. They went, therefore, also into the inn where he had stayed, and
found there the flute-girl weeping and in distress, because he had not taken her with him.
And they having recounted what had happened in the case of the young people, she was
altogether glad when she heard it, and dismissed her grief, and said: Now have I found,
even I, repose here. And she arose and went to them, and was with them a long time, until
they had instructed the king also. And many also of the brethren were gathered together
there, until they heard word of the apostle, that he had gone down to the cities of India, and
was teaching there. And they went away, and joined him.</p>

<head>Acts of the Holy Apostle Thomas,</head>
<p>When He Came into India, and Built the Palace in the Heavens.</p>
<p>And when the apostle came into the cities of India, with Abbanes the merchant, Abbanes
went away to salute Gundaphoros the king, and reported to him about the carpenter whom
he had brought with him; and the king was glad, and ordered him to come in to himself.
And when he had come in, the king said to him: What trade knowest thou? The apostle
says to him: The carpenter’s and house builder’s. The king says to him: What work in
wood knowest thou, then, and what in stone? The apostle says: In wood, ploughs, yokes,
balances, pulleys, and boats, and oars, and masts; and in stone, monuments, temples, royal
palaces. And the king said: Wilt thou build me a palace? And he answered: Yes, I shall
build it, and finish it; for because of this I came, to build houses, and to do carpenter’s work.</p>
<p>And the king having taken him, went forth out of the gates of the city, and began to talk
with him on the way about the building of the palace, and about the foundations, how they
should be laid, until they came to that place in which he wished the building to be. And he
said: Here I wish the building to be. And the apostle says: Yes; for assuredly this place is
convenient for the building. For the place was well wooded, and there was much water
there. The king therefore says: Begin to build. And he said: I cannot begin to build at this
time.</p>
<p>And the king says: When wilt thou be able? And he says: I shall begin in Dius and end
in Xanthicus.2330 And the king wondering, said: Every building is built in summer; but
canst thou build and make a palace in winter itself? And the apostle said: Thus it must be,
and otherwise it is impossible. And the king said: If, therefore, this be thy opinion, mark
out for me how the work is to be, since I shall come here after some time. And the apostle,
having taken a reed, measured the place, and marked it out; and he set the doors towards
the rising of the sun, to look to the light, and the windows towards its setting, to the winds;
and he made the bakehouse to be towards the south, and the water-tank, for abundance,
towards the north. And the king seeing this, said to the apostle: Thou art a craftsman indeed,
and it is fitting that thou shouldst serve kings. And having left many things for him, he
went away.</p>
<p>And from time to time he also sent the money that was necessary, for the living both of
him and the other workmen. And he taking it, dispenses it all, going about the cities and
the places round, distributing and doing kindnesses to the poor and the afflicted, and gave

them rest,2331 saying: The king knows how to obtain royal recompense, and it is necessary
for the poor to have repose for the present.</p>
<p>And after this, the king sent a messenger to the apostle, having written to him as follows:
Show me what thou hast done, or what I am to send thee, or what thou needest. The apostle
sends to him, saying: The palace is built, and only the roof remains to be done. And the
king, having heard, sent him again gold and silver uncoined, and wrote to him: Let the
palace, if it be done, be roofed. And the apostle said to the Lord: I thank Thee, Lord, as to
all things, that Thou didst die for a short time, that I might live in Thee for ever; and hast
sold me, so that Thou mayst deliver many through me. And he did not cease to teach and
refresh the afflicted, saying: These things the Lord hath dispensed to us, and He gives to
each his food; for He is the support of the orphans, and the provider of the widows, and to
all that are afflicted He is rest and repose.</p>
<p>And when the king came into the city, he inquired of his friends about the palace which
Judas, who also is Thomas, had built; and they said to him: He has neither built a palace,
nor done anything else of what he promised to do; but he goes round the cities and the districts,
and if he has anything he gives all to the poor, and teaches one new God,2332 and
heals the diseased, and drives out demons, and does many other extraordinary things; and
we think that he is a magician. But his acts of compassion, and the cures done by him as a
free gift, and still more, his single-mindedness, and gentleness, and fidelity, show that he is
a just man, or an apostle of the new God whom he preaches; for he continually fasts and
prays, and eats only bread with salt, and his drink is water, and he carries one coat, whether
in warm weather or in cold, and he takes nothing from any one, but gives to others even
what he has. The king having heard this, stroked his face with his hands, shaking his head
for a long time.</p>
<p>And he sent for the merchant that had brought him, and for the apostle, and said to
him: Hast thou built me the palace? And he said: Yes, I have built it. And the king said:
When, then, are we to go and see it? And he answered and said: Now thou canst not see
it; but when thou hast departed this life, thou shalt see it. And the king, quite enraged,
ordered both the merchant, and Judas who also is Thomas, to be put in chains, and to be
cast into prison, until he should examine, and learn to whom he had given the king’s property.
And thus I shall destroy him along with the merchant. And the apostle went to prison
rejoicing, and said to the merchant: Fear nothing at all, but only believe in the God proclaimed
by me, and thou shalt be freed from this world, and thou shalt obtain life in the
world to come.</p>

<p>And the king considered by what death he should kill them; and when it seemed good
to him to flay them, and burn them with fire, on that very night Gad the king’s brother fell
ill, and through the grief and imposition which the king suffered he was grievously depressed;
and having sent for the king, he said to him: My brother the king, I commend to thee my
house and my children; for I, on account of the insult that has befallen thee, have been
grieved, and am dying; and if thou do not come down with vengeance upon the head of that
magician, thou wilt give my soul no rest in Hades. And the king said to his brother: During
the whole night I have considered this, how I shall put him to death; and this has seemed
good to me—to flay him and burn him up with fire, both him and with him the merchant
that brought him.</p>
<p>And as they were talking together, the soul of Gad his brother departed. And the king
mourned for Gad exceedingly, for he altogether loved him. And he ordered him to be prepared
for burial in a royal and costly robe. And as this was being done, angels received the
soul of Gad the king’s brother, and took it up into heaven, showing him the places and
dwellings there, asking him: In what sort of a place dost thou wish to dwell? And when
they came near the edifice of Thomas the apostle, which he had built for the king, Gad,
seeing it, said to the angels, I entreat you, my lords, permit me to dwell in one of the underground
chambers of this palace. And they said to him: Thou canst not dwell in this building.
2333 And he said: Wherefore? They say to him: This palace is the one which that
Christian built for thy brother. And he said: I entreat you, my lords, permit me to go to
my brother, that I may buy this palace from him; for my brother does not know what it is
like, and he will sell it to me.</p>
<p>Then the angels let the soul of Gad go. And as they were putting on him the burial robe,
his soul came into him. And he said to those standing round him: Call my brother to me,
that I may beg of him one request. Straightway, therefore, they sent the good news to their
king, saying: Thy brother has come alive again. And the king started up, and along with a
great multitude went to his brother, and went in and stood beside his bed as if thunderstruck,
not being able to speak to him. And his brother said: I know and am persuaded, brother,
that if any one asked of thee the half of thy kingdom, thou wouldst give it for my sake;
wherefore I entreat thee to grant me one favour, which I beg of thee to do me. And the king
answered and said: And what is it that thou askest me to do for thee? And he said: Assure
me by an oath that thou wilt grant it me. And the king swore to him: Of what belongs to
me, whatever thou shalt ask, I will give thee. And he says to him: Sell me that palace which
thou hast in the heavens. And the king said: Whence does a palace in the heavens belong

to me? And he said: That which the Christian who is now in the prison, whom the merchant
bought from a certain Jesus, and brought to thee, built for thee. And as he was at a loss, he
says to him again: I speak of that Hebrew slave whom thou didst wish to punish, as having
suffered some imposition from him, on account of whom I also was grieved and died, and
now have come alive again.</p>
<p>Then the king, having come to know, understood about the eternal benefits that were
conferred upon him and destined for him, and said: That palace I cannot sell thee, but I
pray thee to go into it, and dwell there, and become worthy to be of its inhabitants; but if
thou really wishest to buy such a palace, behold, the man is alive, and will build thee a better
than that.2334 And having sent immediately, he brought out of the prison the apostle, and
the merchant who had been shut up along with him, saying: I entreat thee, as a man entreating
the servant of God, that thou wilt pray for me, and entreat him whose servant thou art,
to pardon me, and overlook what I have done to thee, or even what I meant to do, and that
I may be worthy to be an inhabitant of that house for which indeed I have laboured nothing,
but which thou labouring alone hast built for me, the grace of thy God working with thee;
and that I may become a servant, I also, and slave of this God whom thou proclaimest. And
his brother, falling down before the apostle, said: I entreat thee, and supplicate before thy
God, that I may become worthy of this ministry and service, and may be allotted to become
worthy of those things which were shown me by his angels.</p>
<p>And the apostle, seized with joy, said: I make full confession2335 to Thee, Lord Jesus,
that Thou hast revealed Thy truth in these men: for Thou alone art a God of truth, and not
another; and Thou art He who knowest all things that are unknown to many: Thou art He,
Lord, who in all things showest compassion and mercy to men; for men, through the error
that is in them, have overlooked Thee, but Thou hast not overlooked them. And now, when
I am entreating and supplicating Thee, accept the king and his brother, and unite them into
Thy fold, having cleansed them by Thy purification, and anointed them with Thy oil, from
the error which encompasseth them; and protect them also from the wolves, bringing them
into Thy meadows; and give them to drink of Thy ambrosial fountain, that is never muddy
and never faileth: for they entreat Thee, and supplicate, and wish to become Thy ministers
<note type="footnote">2334 One of themss. here ends the history in these words:—And he sent, and brought out Thomas, and said
to him: Pardon us if we have in ignorance been in any way harsh to thee; and make us to be partakers of him
whom thou preachest. And the apostle says: I too rejoice with you, that you are made partakers of His kingdom.
And he took and enlightened them, having given them the washing of grace in the name of Father, and Son,
and Holy Spirit, to whom is due all glory and kingdom without end. And when they had gone up straightway
out of the water, the Saviour appeared to them, so that the apostle wondered, and a great light shone brighter
than the rays of the sun. And having confirmed their faith, he went out, going on his way in the Lord.</note>

enemies, and for Thy sake to be hated by them, and insulted, and to die; as Thou also for
our sakes didst suffer all these things, that Thou mightst gain us to Thyself, as being Lord,
and truly a good shepherd. And do Thou grant them that they may have confidence in Thee
alone, and aid from Thee, and hope of their salvation, which they obtain from Thee alone,
and that they may be confirmed in Thy mysteries; and they shall receive the perfect benefits
of Thy graces and gifts, and flourish in Thy service, and bear fruit to perfection in Thy
Father.</p>
<p>King Gundaphoros, therefore, and Gad, having been altogether set apart by the apostle,
followed him, not at all going back, they also providing for those that begged of them, giving
to all, and relieving all. And they entreated him that they might also then receive the seal
of baptism; and they said to him: As our souls are at ease, and as we are earnest about God,
give us the seal; for we have heard thee saying that the God whom thou proclaimest recognises
through his seal his own sheep. And the apostle said to them: And I am glad, and entreat
you to receive this seal, and to communicate with me in this thanksgiving2336 and blessing
of God, and to be made perfect in it;2337 for this Jesus Christ whom I proclaim is Lord and
God of all, and He is the Father of truth, in whom I have taught you to believe. And he
ordered to bring them oil, in order that through the oil they might receive the seal. They
brought the oil, therefore, and lighted many lamps, for it was night.2338</p>
<p>And the apostle arose, and sealed them; and the Lord was revealed to them, through a
voice saying, Peace to you, brethren! And they heard His voice only, but His form they saw
not; for they had not yet received the ratification2339 of the seal. And the apostle, having
taken oil, and poured it over their head, and salved and anointed them, began to say: Come,
holy name of Christ, which is above every name; come, power of the Most High, and perfect
compassion; come, grace most high; come, compassionate mother; come, thou that hast
charge2340 of the male child; come, thou who revealest secret mysteries; come, mother of

And they all believed in our Lord Jesus Christ: and the whole of India became believing. The last sentence in

of the five members—intelligence, thought, purpose, reflection, reasoning—communicate

appeared to them a young man holding a burning torch, so that their lamps were even
darkened by the approach2341 of its light. And he went out, and disappeared from their
sight. And the apostle said to the Lord: Thy light, Lord, is too great for us, and we cannot
bear it; for it is too much for our sight. And when light came, and it was dawn, having
broken bread, he made them partakers of the thanksgiving2342 of Christ. And they rejoiced
and exulted; and many others also believed, and were added, and came to the refuge of the
Saviour.</p>
<p>And the apostle ceased not proclaiming, and saying to them: Men and women, boys
and girls, young men and maidens, vigorous and aged, both bond and free, withhold
yourselves from fornication, and covetousness, and the service of the belly; for under these
three heads all wickedness comes. For fornication maims the mind, and darkens the eyes
of the soul, and becomes a hindrance of the due regulation of the body, changing the whole
man into feebleness, and throwing the whole body into disease. And insatiableness puts
the soul into fear and shame, existing by what pertains to the body,2343 and forcibly seizing
what belongs to another;<gap reason="omitted"/>and the service of the belly throws the soul into cares and troubles
and griefs<gap reason="omitted"/>Since, therefore, you have been set free from these, you are without care, and
without grief, and without fear; and there remains to you that which was said by the Saviour:

to receive his debt. And he said to them: The creditor,2348 indeed, always wishes to receive
more; but let us give him what is proper. And having blessed them, he took bread and oil,
and herbs and salt, and gave them to eat. But he continued in his fasting, for the Lord’s day
was about to dawn. And on the night following, while he was asleep, the Lord came and
stood by his head, saying: Thomas, rise up early and bless them all; and after the prayer and
service go along the eastern road two miles, and there I shall show in thee my glory. For
because thou goest away, many shall flee to me for refuge, and thou shalt reprove the nature

through me; but let us pray and entreat Him that nothing may be a hindrance to us towards
Him, but as at all times let it now also be done unto us according to His purpose and will.
And having thus spoken, he laid his hands upon them and blessed them. And having broken
the bread of the Eucharist, he gave it to them, saying: This Eucharist shall be2349 to you for
compassion, and mercy, and recompense, and not for judgment. And they said: Amen.</p>

<p>About the Dragon and the Young Man.</p>
<p>And the apostle went forth to go where the Lord had bidden him. And when he came
near the second milestone he turned a little out of the way, and saw the body of a beautiful
youth lying; and he said: Lord, was it for this that Thou broughtest me out to come here,
that I might see this trial? Thy will therefore be done, as Thou purposest. And he began to
pray, and to say: Lord, Judge of the living, and of those that are lying dead, and Lord of all,
and Father—Father not only of the souls that are in bodies, but also of those that have gone
out of them; for of the souls that are in pollutions Thou art Lord and Judge—come at this
time, when I call upon Thee, and show Thy glory upon him that is lying down here. And
he turned and said to those that followed him: This affair has not happened idly; but the
enemy has wrought and effected this, that he might make an assault upon him; and you see
that he has availed himself of no other form, and has wrought through no other living being,
but through his subject.</p>
<p>And when the apostle had thus spoken, behold, a great dragon came forth from his den,
knocking his head, and brandishing his tail down to the ground, and, using a loud voice,
said to the apostle: I shall say before thee for what cause I have put him to death, since thou
art here in order to reprove my works. And the apostle says: Yes, say on. And the dragon:
There is a certain woman in this place exceedingly beautiful; and as she was once passing
by, I saw her, and fell in love with her, and I followed and watched her; and I found this
young man kissing her, and he also had intercourse with her, and did with her other
shameful things. And to me indeed it was pleasant to tell thee this, for I know that thou art
the twin-brother of Christ, and always bringest our race to nought. But, not wishing to
harass her, I did not at this time put him to death; but I watched him passing by in the
evening, and struck him, and killed him, and especially as he had dared to do this on the
Lord’s day.2350 And the apostle inquired of him, saying: Tell me, of what seed and of what
race art thou?</p>
<p>And he said to him: I am the offspring of the race of the serpent, and hurtful of the
hurtful; I am son of him who hurt and struck the four brothers that stood; I am son of him
who sits on the throne of destruction, and takes his own from what he has lent;2351 I am
son of that apostate who encircles the globe; I am kinsman to him who is outside of the
ocean, whose tail lies in his mouth; I am he who went into paradise through the hedge, and
spoke with Eve what my father bade me speak to her; I am he who inflamed and fired Cain
to kill his brother, and through me thorns and prickles sprang up in the ground; I am he
who cast down the angels from above, and bound them down by the desires of women, that

earth-born2352 children might be produced from them, and that I might work my will in
them;2353 I am he who hardened the heart of Pharaoh, that he should murder the children
of Israel, and keep them down by the hard yoke of slavery; I am he who caused the multitude
to err in the desert when they made the calf; I am he who inflamed Herod and incited Caiaphas
to the lying tales of falsehood before Pilate, for this became me; I am he who inflamed
Judas, and bought him, that he should betray Christ; I am he who inhabits and holds the
abyss of Tartarus, and the Son of God has wronged me against my will, and has gathered
his own out of me; I am the kinsman of him who is to come from the east, to whom also
power has been given to do whatever he will upon the earth.</p>
<p>And that dragon having thus spoken in the hearing of all the multitude, the apostle
raised his voice on high, and said: Cease henceforth, O thou most unabashed, and be
ashamed and altogether put to death; for the end of thy destruction is at hand, and do not
dare to say what thou hast done through thy dependants. And I order thee, in the name of
that Jesus who even until now makes a struggle against you for the sake of His own human
beings, to suck out the poison which thou hast put into this man, and to draw it forth, and
take it out of him. And the dragon said: The time of our end is by no means at hand, as
thou hast said. Why dost thou force me to take out what I have put into him, and to die
before the time? Assuredly, when my father shall draw forth and suck out what he has put
into the creation, then his end will come. And the apostle said to him: Show us, therefore,
now the nature of thy father. And the dragon went up, and put his mouth upon the wound
of the young man, and sucked the gall out of it. And in a short time the skin of the young
man, which was like purple, grew white, and the dragon swelled. And when the dragon had
drawn up all the gall into himself, the young man sprang up and stood, and ran and fell at
the apostle’s feet. And the dragon, being swelled up, shrieked out and died, and his poison
and gall were poured forth; and in the place where his poison was poured forth there was
made a great chasm, and that dragon was swallowed up. And the apostle said to the king
and his brother: Take workmen, and fill up the place in which the dragon has been swallowed
up, and lay foundations, and build houses-above it, that it may be made a dwelling-place
for the strangers.</p>
<p>And the young man said to the apostle, with many tears: I have sinned against the God
proclaimed by thee, and against thee, but I ask pardon of thee; for thou art a man having
two forms, and wherever thou wishest there art thou found, and thou art held in by no one,
as I see. For I beheld that man, when I stood beside thee, who also said to thee, I have many
wonders to show by means of thee, and I have great works to accomplish by means of thee,
for which thou shalt obtain a reward; and thou shalt make many to live, and they shall be

<pb n="1625"/>
in repose and eternal light as the children of God: do thou therefore bring alive—he says,
speaking to thee about me—this young man who has been cast down by the enemy, and in
all time be the overseer of him. Thou hast, then, well come hither, and again thou shalt well
go away to him, he being not at all forsaken by thee. And I am without care and reproach,
for the dawn has risen upon me from the care of the night, and I am at rest; and I have also
been released from him who exasperated me to do these things: for I have sinned against
Him who taught me the contrary, and I have destroyed him who is the kinsman of the night,
who forced me to sin by his own practices; and I have found that kinsman of mine who is
like the light. I have destroyed him who darkens and blinds those who are subject to him,
lest they should know what they are doing, and, ashamed of their works, withdraw themselves
from them, and their deeds have an end: and I have found Him whose works are light, and
whose deeds are truth, of which whoever does them shall not repent. I have been set free
also from him in whom falsehood abides, whom darkness as a covering goes before, and
shame conducting herself impudently in idleness follows after. And I have found also Him
who shows me what is beautiful, that I should lay hold of it, the Son of the truth, who is
kinsman of concord, who, driving away the mist, enlightens His own creation, and heals its
wounds, and overturns its enemies. But I entreat thee, O man of God, make me again to
behold and see Him, now become hidden from me, that I may also hear His voice, the
wonders of which I cannot declare: for it is not of the nature of this bodily organ.</p>
<p>And the apostle said to him: If, as thou hast also said, thou hast cast off the knowledge
of those things which thou hast received, and if thou knowest who has wrought these things
in thee, and if thou shalt become a disciple and hearer of Him of whom, through thy living
love, thou now desirest the sight, thou shalt both see Him, and shalt be with Him for ever,
and shalt rest in His rest, and shalt be in His joy. But if thou art rather carelessly disposed
towards Him, and again returnest to thy former deeds, and lettest go that beauty and that
beaming countenance which has now been displayed to thee, and if the splendour of the
light of Him whom thou now desirest be forgotten by thee, thou shalt be deprived not only
of this life, but also of that which is to come; and thou shalt go to him whom thou hast said
thou hast destroyed, and shalt no longer behold Him whom thou hast said thou hast found.</p>
<p>And when the apostle had thus spoken, he went into the city, holding that young man
by the hand, and saying to him: Those things which thou hast beheld, my child, are a few
out of the many which God has: for it is not about these things that appear that the good
news is brought to us, but greater things than these are promised to us; but inasmuch as we
are in the body, we cannot tell and speak out what He will do for our souls. If we say that
He affords us light, it is seen by us, and we have it; and if riches, they exist and appear in
this world, and we name them, since it has been said, With difficulty will a rich man enter
into the kingdom of the heavens.2354 And if we speak of fine clothing, which they who delight
<note type="footnote">2354 Matt. xix. 23.</note>

<pb n="1626"/>
in this life put on, it has been said, They that wear soft things are in kings’ palaces;2355 and
if costly dinners, about these we have received a commandment to keep away from them,
not to be burdened by carousing and drunkenness and the cares of life;2356 as also in the
Gospel it has been said, Take no heed for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
nor for your body, what ye shall put on: because the life is more than food, and the body
than clothing.2357 And if we speak of this rest lasting only for a season, its judgment has
also been ordained. But we speak about the upper world, about God and angels, about
ambrosial food, about garments that last and become not old, about those things which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath there come into the heart of sinful men what God
has prepared for those that love Him.2358 Do thou also therefore believe in Him, that thou
mayst live; and have confidence in Him, and thou shalt never die. For He is not persuaded
by gifts, that thou shouldst offer them to Him; nor does He want sacrifices, that thou shouldst
sacrifice to Him. But look to Him, and thou shalt not look in vain, for His comeliness and
desirable beauty will make thee love Him; and neither will He allow thee to turn thyself
away from Him.</p>
<p>And when the apostle was thus speaking to that young man, a great multitude joined
them. And the apostle looked, and saw them lifting themselves up that they might see him;
and they went up into elevated places. And the apostle said to them: Ye men who have
come to the assembly of Christ, and who wish to believe in Jesus, take an example from this,
and see that if you do not get high up, you cannot see me, who am small, and cannot get a
look of me, who am like yourselves. If, then, you cannot see me, who am like yourselves,
unless you raise yourselves a little from the earth, how can you see Him who lives above,
and is now found below, unless you first raise yourselves out of your former behaviour, and
unprofitable deeds, and troublesome desires, and the riches that are left behind here, and
create things that are of the earth, and that grow old, and the garments that are destroyed,
and the beauty that ages and vanishes away, yea, even out of the whole body in which all
these have been stored past, and which grows old, and becomes dust, returning into its own
nature? for all these things the body itself sets up.2359 But rather believe in our Lord Jesus
Christ, whom we proclaim to you, in order that your hope may be upon Him, and that you
may have life in Him to ages of ages, that He may be your fellow-traveller in this land, and
may release you from error, and may become2360 a haven for you in this troublous sea.

And there shall be for you also a fountain welling out in this thirsty land, and a fold full of

<p>Then the multitude of those assembled that heard, wept, and said to the apostle: O man
of God, as for the God whom thou proclaimest, we dare not say that we are his, because our
works which we have done are alien from him, not pleasing to him; but if he has compassion
upon us, and pities us, and delivers us, overlooking our former doings; and if he set us free
from the evil things which we did when we were in error, and shall not take into account
nor keep the recollection of our former sins, we shall become his servants, and we shall do
his will to the end. And the apostle answered and said to them: He does not reckon against
you the sins which you did, being in error; but He overlooks your transgressions which you
have done in ignorance.2361</p>

<p>About the Demon that Dwelt in the Woman.</p>
<p>And the apostle went into the city, all the multitude accompanying him; and he thought
of going to the parents of the young man whom, when killed by the dragon, he had brought
to life; for they earnestly entreated him to come to them, and to enter into their house.</p>
<p>And a certain woman, exceedingly beautiful, suddenly uttered a loud cry, saying: O
apostle of the new God, who hast come into India, and servant of that holy and only good
God—for through thee he is proclaimed the Saviour of the souls that come unto him, and
through thee he heals the bodies of those that are punished by the enemy, and thou hast
become the cause of life to all who turn to him—order me to be brought before thee, that I
may declare to thee what has happened to me, and that perhaps there may be hope to me
from thee and those who stand beside thee may have more and more hope in the God whom
thou proclaimest. For I am not a little tormented by the adversary, who has assailed me for
now a period of five years. As a woman, I formerly sat down in peace, and peace encompassed
me on all sides and I had nothing to trouble me, for of nothing else2362 had I a care. And
it happened on one of the days as I was coming forth from the bath, there met me one like
a man troubled and disturbed; and his voice and utterance seemed to me to be indistinct
and very weak. And he said, standing over against me, Thou and I shall be in one love, and
we shall have intercourse with each other, as a man is coupled with his wife. And I answered
him, saying, To my betrothed I consented not, entreating him not to marry me; and to thee,
wishing to have intercourse with me as it were in adultery, how shall I give myself up? And
having thus spoken, I went away from him. And to my maid I said, Hast thou seen the
young man and his shamelessness, how shamelessly and boldly he talks to me? And she
said to me, It was an old man I saw talking with thee. And when I was in my own house,
and had supped, my mind suggested to me some suspicion, and especially because he had
appeared to me in two forms. I fell asleep, having this same thing in my thoughts. And he
came that night, and made me share in his filthy commerce. And I saw him when it was
day, and fled from him; but, according to his wont, he came at night and abused me. And
now, as thou seest me, I have been tormented by him five years, and he has not departed
from me. But I know and am persuaded that even demons, and spirits, and avenging deities,
are subject to thee, and tremble at thy prayer. Pray, then, for me, and drive away from me
the demon that torments me, that I also may become free, and may be brought to my former
nature, and I shall receive the gift2363 that has been granted to my kindred.</p>
<p>And the apostle said: O irrepressible wickedness! O the shamelessness of the enemy!
O the sorcerer that is never at rest! O the ill-favoured one, bring to subjection the well-favoured!
O the many-formed one! He appears just as he may wish, but his essence cannot
<note type="footnote">2362 Or, no one else.</note>

<pb n="1629"/>
be changed. O offspring of the crafty and insatiable one! O bitter tree, which also his fruits
are like! O thou who art of the devil, who fights over those who do not belong to him! O
thou who art of the deceit that uses shamelessness! O thou who art of the wickedness that
creeps like a serpent, and art thyself his kindred! And when the apostle had thus spoken
the fiend stood before him, no one seeing him but the woman and the apostle, and with a
very loud voice he said in the hearing of all: What have we to do with thee, O apostle of the
Most High? What have we to do with thee, O servant of Jesus Christ? What have we to do
with thee, O thou that sittest in council with the Holy Spirit. Wherefore dost thou wish to
destroy us, when our time has not yet come? On what account dost thou wish to take away
our power? for until the present hour we have had hope and time left us.2364 What have
we to do with thee? Thou hast power over thine own, and we over our own. Why dost thou
wish to use tyranny against us, and especially thou who teachest others not to use tyranny?
Why dost thou want those who do not belong to thee, as if thou wert not satisfied with thine
own? Why dost thou liken thyself to the Son of God, who has done us hurt? For thou art
like him altogether, just as if thou hadst been brought forth by him. For we thought to bring
him also under the yoke, like the rest; but he turned, and held us under his hand. For we
did not know him; but he deceived us by the form which he had put on, and his poverty
and his want; for when we saw him such, we thought him to be a man clothed with flesh,
not knowing that it was he who makes men live. And he gave us power over our own, and,
in the time in which we live, not to let our own go, but to employ ourselves about them.
But thou wishest to get more than is necessary, or than has been given thee, and to overpower
us.</p>
<p>And having thus spoken, the demon wept, saying: I let thee go, my most lovely yokefellow,
2365 whom I found long ago and was at rest; I leave thee, my beloved and trusty sister,
in whom I was well pleased. What I shall do I know not, or whom I shall call upon to hear
me and protect me. I know what I shall do. I shall go to some place where the fame of this
man has not been heard, and perhaps I shall call thee, my beloved, by a new name.2366 And
lifting up his voice, he said: Abide in peace, having received an asylum with a greater than
I; but I, as I have said, will go away and seek thy like, and if I find her not I shall again return
to thee: for I know that when thou art beside this man, thou hast an asylum in him; but
when he has gone away, thou shalt be as thou wast before he made his appearance, and him
indeed wilt thou forget, and to me there will again be opportunity and boldness; but now I
am afraid of the name of him who has delivered thee. And having thus said, the demon

disappeared. And just when he had disappeared, fire and smoke were seen there, and all
there present were struck with amazement.</p>
<p>And the apostle seeing this, said to them: Nothing strange or unusual has that demon
shown, but his own nature, in which also he shall be burnt up; for the fire shall consume
him, and the smoke of him shall be scattered abroad. And he began to say: O Jesus Christ,
the secret mystery which has been revealed to us, Thou art He who disclosest to us all
manner of mysteries, who hast set me apart from all my companions, and who hast told me
three words with which I am set on fire, and I cannot tell them to others; O Jesus, man slain,
dead, buried; Jesus, God of God, and Saviour who bringest the dead to life, and healest those
who are diseased; O Jesus, who appearest to be in want, and savest as if in want of nothing,
catching the fishes for the morning and the evening meal, and establishing all in abundance
with a little bread; Jesus, who didst rest from the toil of the journey as a man, and walk upon
the waves as God;2367 Jesus Most High, voice arising from perfect compassion, Saviour of
all, the right hand of the light overthrowing him that is wicked in his own kind, and bringing
all his kind into one place; Thou who art only begotten, the first-born of many brethren,2368
God of God Most High, man despised until now; Jesus Christ, who overlookest us not when
we call upon Thee; who hast been shown forth to all in Thy human life; who for our sakes
hast been judged and kept in prison, and freest all that are in bonds; who hast been called
a deceiver,2369 and who deliverest Thine own from deception: I entreat Thee in behalf of
those standing and entreating Thee, and those that believe in Thee; for they pray to obtain
Thy gifts, being of good hope in Thine aid, occupying Thy place of refuge in Thy majesty;
they give audience, so as to hear from us the words that have been spoken to them. Let Thy
peace come and dwell in them, that they may be purified from their former deeds, and may
put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new now declared to them by me.2370</p>
<p>And having laid his hands on them, he blessed them, saying: The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be upon you for ever!2371 And they said, Amen. And the woman begged of him,
saying: Apostle of the Most High, give me the seal, that that foe may not come back upon
me again. Then he made her come near him; and putting his hand upon her, he sealed her
in the name of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. And many others also were sealed along
with her. And the apostle ordered his servant2372 to set out a table; and they set out a
bench2373 which they found there. And having spread a linen cloth upon it, he put on it

who hast deemed us worthy to communicate of the Eucharist of Thy sacred body and honourable
blood, behold, we are emboldened by the thanksgiving2374 and invocation of Thy
sacred name; come now, and communicate with us. And he began to say: Come, perfect
compassion; come, communion with mankind; come, Thou that knowest the mysteries of
the chosen one; come, Thou that communicatest in all the combats2375 of the noble combatant;
come, peace that revealest the great things of all greatness; come, Thou that disclosest
secrets, and makest manifest things not to be spoken; the sacred dove which has brought
forth twin young; come, thou secret mother; come, Thou who art manifest in Thy deeds,
and givest joy and rest to those who are united to Thee; come and communicate with us in
this Eucharist, which we make in Thy name, and in the love2376 in which we are united in
calling upon Thee.2377 And having thus said, he made the sign of the cross upon the bread,
and broke it, and began to distribute it. And first he gave it to the woman, saying: This
shall be to thee for remission of sins, and the ransom of everlasting transgressions. And
after her, he gave also to all the others who had received the seal.</p>

<p>About the Young Man Who Killed the Maiden.</p>
<p>And there was a certain young man who had done a nefarious deed; and having come
to the apostle, he took the bread of the Eucharist into his mouth, and his two hands immediately
withered, so that he could no longer bring them to his mouth. And those who were
present and saw him told the apostle what had happened. And he, having summoned him,
said: Tell me, my child, and be ashamed of nothing,2378 what thou hast done, and why thou
hast come hither; for the Eucharist of the Lord has convicted thee. For this gracious gift
coming to many is especially healing to those who approach it through faith and love; but
thee it has withered away, and what has happened has happened not without some working
cause. And the young man who had been convicted by the Eucharist of the Lord came up,
and fell at the apostle’s feet, and prayed him, saying: An evil deed has been done by me, yet
I thought to do something good. I was in love with a certain woman living outside of the
city in an inn, and she loved me. And I having heard from thee, and believed that thou
proclaimest the living God, came and received the seal from thee along with the others; and
thou saidst, Whoever shall indulge in filthy intercourse, and especially in adultery, shall not
have life with the God whom I proclaim.2379 Since, then, I altogether loved her, I begged
of her, and persuaded her to live with me in chaste and pure intercourse, as thou thyself
teachest; but she would not. When therefore she would not, I took a sword and killed her;
for I could not see her living in adultery with another.</p>
<p>The apostle, having heard this, said: O maddening intercourse, into what shamelessness
dost thou lead! O unrestrained lust, how hast thou brought him into subjection to do this!
O work of the serpent, how dost thou rage in thine own! And the apostle ordered water to
be brought him in a dish. And when the water had been brought, he said: Come waters
from the living waters, existing from the existing, and sent to us; the fountain sent to us
from repose, the power of salvation coming from that power that subdues all things, and
subjects them to its own will; come and dwell in these waters, that the gracious gift of the
Holy Spirit may be fully perfected in them. And he said to the young man: Go, wash thy
hands in these waters. And when he had washed, they were restored. And the apostle said
to him: Dost thou believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, that He can do all things? And he said:
Even though I am least of all, I believe; but this I did, thinking to do a good thing: for I implored
her, as also I told thee; but she would not be persuaded by me to keep herself chaste.</p>
<p>And the apostle said to him: Come, let us go to the inn where thou didst this deed, and
let us see what has happened. And the young man went before the apostle on the road; and
when they came to the inn, they found her lying. And the apostle, seeing her, was disheartened,
for she was a beautiful maiden; and he ordered her to be brought into the middle
<note type="footnote">2378 Or, stand in awe of no one.</note>
<note type="footnote">2379 1 Cor. vi. 9.</note>

<pb n="1633"/>
of the inn. And having put her on a couch, they brought it, and set it in the midst of the
court-yard of the inn. And the apostle laid his hand on her, and began to say: Jesus, who
always appearest to us—for this Thou always wishest, that we should seek Thee—and Thou
Thyself hast given us this power of asking and receiving;2380 and not only hast Thou given
us this, but hast also taught us how to pray;2381 who art not seen by bodily eyes, but who
art not altogether hidden from those of our soul, and who art hidden in Thy form, but
manifested to us by Thy works; and by Thy many deeds we have recognised Thee as we go
on, and Thou hast given us Thy gifts without measure, saying, Ask, and it shall be given
you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.2382 We pray, therefore,
having suspicion of our sins;2383 and we ask of Thee not riches, nor gold, nor silver, nor
possessions, nor any of those things that come from the earth and go into the earth again;
but this we beg of Thee, and entreat that in Thy holy name Thou raise this woman lying
here by Thy power, to the glory and faith of those standing by.</p>
<p>And when he had thus prayed, he sealed the young man, and said to him: Go, and take
her by the hand, and say to her, I through my hands killed thee with the sword;2384 and
again I raise thee by my hands, in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the young man
went and stood by her, saying: I have believed in Thee, O Christ Jesus. And looking upon
Judas Thomas the apostle, he said to him: Pray for me, that my Lord, upon whom also I
call, may come to my help. And having laid his hand on her hand, he said: Come, Lord
Jesus Christ, giving this woman life, and me the earnest of Thy faith. And immediately, as
he drew her hand, she sprang up, and sat, looking at the great multitude standing round.
And she also saw the apostle standing opposite to her; and having left the couch, she sprang
up, and fell at his feet, and took hold of his garments, saying: I pray thee, my lord, where
is that other who is with thee, who has not left me to remain in that fearful and grievous
place, but has given me up to thee, saying, Do thou take her, that she may be made perfect,
and thereafter brought into her own place?</p>
<p>And the apostle says to her: Tell us where thou hast been. And she answered: Dost
thou, who wast with me, to whom also I was entrusted, wish to hear? And she began to say:
A certain man received me, hateful in appearance, all black, and his clothing exceedingly
filthy; and he led me away to a place where there were many chasms, and a great stench and
most hateful odour were given forth thence; and he made me bend down into each chasm,
and I saw in the chasm blazing fire; and wheels of fire ran there, and souls were hung upon

those wheels, and were dashed against each other. And there was there crying and great
lamentation, and there was none released. And that man said to me, These souls are of
thine own nation, and for a certain number of days2385 they have been given over to pun-
ishment and torture; and then others are brought in instead of them; and likewise also these
are again succeeded by others. These are they who have exchanged the intercourse of man
and wife. And again I looked down, and saw infants heaped upon each other, and struggling
and lying upon each other; and he answered and said to me, These are their children, and
for this have they been placed here for a testimony against them.</p>
<p>And he brought me to another chasm, and I bent down and saw mud, and worms
spouting forth, and souls wallowing there; and a great gnashing of teeth was heard thence
from them. And that man said to me, These are the souls of women that left their own
husbands, and went and committed adultery with others, and who have been brought to
this torment. He showed me another chasm, into which I bent down and saw souls hung
up, some by the tongue, some by the hair, some by the hands, some by the feet, head
downwards, and smoked with smoke and sulphur; about whom that man who was with me
answered me, These souls which are hung up by the tongue are slanderers, and such as have
uttered false and disgraceful words; those that are hung up by the hair2386are those that are
shameless, and that have gone about with uncovered heads in the world; these hung up by
the hands are those who have taken what belongs to others, and have stolen, and who have
never given anything to the poor, nor assisted the afflicted; but they so acted, wishing to get
everything, and giving no heed at all to justice and the laws; and these hung up by the feet
are those who lightly and eagerly ran in wicked ways, and disorderly wickedness, not looking
after the sick, and not aiding those departing this life, and on account of this each individual
soul is requited for what has been done by it.</p>
<p>Again leading me away, he showed me a cavern, exceedingly dark, exhaling a great
stench; and many souls were peeping out thence, wishing to get some share of the air, but
their keepers would not let them peep out. And he who was with me said, This is the prison
of those souls which thou seest; for when they shall complete their punishments for those
things which each one has done, afterwards again others succeed them—and there are some
also quite used up—and are given up to other punishments. Those, then, who guarded the
souls that were in the dark cave said to the man that had charge of me, Give her to us, that
we may take her in beside the others, until the time comes for her to be given up to punishment.
And he answered them, I will not give her to you, for I am afraid of him who gave
her up to me; for I received no orders to leave her here, and I shall take her up with me until
I get some injunction about her. And he took me and brought me to another place, in which

were men who were bitterly tortured. And he that is like thee took me and gave me up to
thee, having thus said to thee, Take her, since she is one of the creatures that have been led
astray. And I was taken by thee, and am now before thee. I beg, therefore, and supplicate
thee that I may not go into those places of punishment which I saw.</p>
<p>And the apostle said to the multitudes standing by: You have heard, brethren, what
this woman has recounted; and these are not the only punishments, but there are others
worse than these; and if you do not turn to this God whom I proclaim, and refrain from
your former works and deeds which you have done without knowledge, in these punishments
you shall have your end. Believe, therefore, in our Lord Jesus Christ, and He will forgive
you the sins done by you heretofore, and will purify you from all the bodily desires that
abide in the earth, and will heal you from the faults that follow after you, and go along with
you, and are found before you. And let each of you put off the old man, and put on the new,
and leave your former course of conduct and behaviour; and let those that steal steal no
more, but let them live, labouring and working;2387 and let the adulterers no more commit
adultery, lest they give themselves up to everlasting punishment; for adultery is with God
an evil altogether grievous above other evils. Put away also from yourselves covetousness,
and lying, and drunkenness, and slandering, and requiting evil for evil: for all these are
alien and strange to the God proclaimed by us; but rather live in faith, and meekness, and
holiness, and hope, in which God rejoices, that ye may become His servants, having received
from Him gracious gifts, which few or none receive.</p>
<p>All the people therefore believed, and presented their souls obedient to the living God
and Christ Jesus, enjoying His blessed works, and His holy service. And they brought much
money for the service of the widows; for he had them collected in the cities, and he sent to
all of them by his own servants2388 what was necessary, both clothing and food. But he did
not cease proclaiming and saying to them, and showing that this is Jesus the Christ, concerning
whom the Scriptures proclaimed that He should come, and be crucified, and be raised
from the dead after three days. And he showed them a second time, beginning from the
prophets, and explaining the things concerning Christ, and that it was necessary for Him
549
to come, and for all things to be fulfilled that had been said to us beforehand concerning
Him.2389</p>
<p>And the report of him ran through all the cities and countries; and all who had persons
sick or tormented by unclean spirits brought them, and they were healed. Some also they
laid on the road by which he was to pass, and he healed them all by the power of the Lord.2390

Then said all with one accord who had been healed by him, with one voice: Glory to Thee,
Jesus, who givest Thy healing to all alike by means of Thy servant and apostle Thomas. And
being in good health, and rejoicing, we pray Thee that we may be of Thy flock, and be
numbered among Thy sheep; receive us, therefore, O Lord, and consider not our transgressions
and former offences which we did, being in ignorance.</p>
<p>And the apostle said: Glory to the only-begotten from the Father;2391 glory to the firstborn
of many brethren;2392 Glory to Thee, the defender and helper of those who come to
Thy place of refuge; Thou that sleepest not, and raisest those that are asleep; that livest and
bringest to life those that are lying in death; O God Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, redeemer
and helper, refuge and rest of all that labour in Thy work, who affordest health to
those who for Thy name’s sake bear the burden of the day, and the icy coldness of the night;
we give thanks for the gracious gifts that have been given us by Thee, and for the help from
Thee bestowed upon us, and Thy providential care that has come upon us from Thee. Perfect
these things upon us, therefore, unto the end, that we may have confidence in Thee; look
upon us, because for Thy sake we have left our homes, and for Thy sake have become
strangers gladly and willingly; look upon us, O Lord, because for Thy sake we have abandoned
our possessions, that we may have Thee for a possession that shall not be taken away; look
upon us, O Lord, because we have left those related to us by ties of kindred in order that we
may be united in relationship to Thee; look upon us, O Lord, who have left our fathers and
mothers, and those that nourished us, that we may behold Thy Father, and be satisfied with
His divine nourishment: look upon us, O Lord, because for Thy sake we have left our bodily
yoke-fellows,2393 and our earthly fruit, in order that we may share in that intercourse which
is lasting and true, and bring forth true fruits, whose nature is from above, the enjoyment
of which no one can take away from us, with which we abide, and they abide with us.</p>

<head>Consummation of Thomas the Apostle.2394</head>
<note type="footnote">2394 The following translation of a ms. in the Bodleian Library, transcribed by Tischendorf (Apocal. Apocr.,
p. 158), gives a fuller account of the martyrdom of St. Thomas:— MARTYRDOM OF THE HOLY AND ALLRENOWNED
APOSTLE THOMAS. After the apostle had gone forth, according to the command of our Lord,
and God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Lord appeared to him, saying: Peace to thee, my disciple and apostle!
And the apostle fell on his face on the ground, and prayed the Lord to reveal to him the circumstances of his
precious departure. And the Lord said to him: Misdæus is contriving a plan to destroy thee very soon; but,
behold, he will come to me. And after having sealed him, He ascended into the heavens. And the apostle taught
the people, and there was added unto the flock of Christ. But some men who hated Christ accused him before
King Misdeus, saying: Destroy this sorcerer, who corrupts and deceives the people in this new one God whom
he proclaims. Moreover, he has deceived thy lady and thy son. On hearing this, Misdeus, without inquiry,
ordered him to be laid hold of, and shut up in prison. And they quickly did what they were ordered, and threw
him into the prison, and sealed it. And when the women who believed in God had heard that Judas was shut
up, they gave a great sum of money to the warders, and went in to him in the prison. And the apostle says to
them: My daughters, handmaidens of Jesus Christ, listen to me. In my last day I address you, because I shall
no more speak in the body; for, lo, I am taken up to my Lord Jesus Christ, who has had pity upon me, who
humbled Himself even to my littleness. And I rejoice that the time is at hand for my change from this, that I
may depart and receive my reward in the end; for my Lord is just. And at the end of his discourse to them, he
said: O my Saviour, who hast endured much for our sake, let Thy mercies be upon us. And he sent them away,
saying: The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you! And they grieved and wept, knowing that King Misdeus was
going to put him to death. And Judas heard the warders contending with each other, and saying: Let us go and
tell the king, Thy wife and thy son are going to the prison to this sorcerer, and for their sakes thou shouldst put
him to death soon. And at dawn they arose and went to King Misdeus, and said: My Lord, release that sorcerer,
or cause him to be shut up elsewhere; for though we shut in the prisoners, and secure the doors, when we rise
we find them opened. Nay, more: thy wife and son will not keep away from the man any more than the rest of
them. And when the king heard this, he went to look at the seals. And he looked all about them on the doors,
and found them as they were. Then he said to the jailors: What are you telling lies about? for certainly these
seals are quite safe: and how do you say that Tertia, and Mygdonia, and my son go within the prison? And the
warders said: We have told thee the truth, O king. And after this the king went into the prison, and sent for
the apostle. And when he came, they took off his girdle, and set him before the tribunal. And the king said:
Art thou a slave, or free? And Thomas said: I am One’s slave. Thou hast no power over me whatever. And
Misdæus says: Didst thou run away and come to this country? Thomas: I came here to save many, and I am
to depart from my body by thy hands. Misdæus says to him: Who is thy master? and what is his name? and
what country dost thou belong to? Thomas: Thou canst not hear His true name at this time; but I tell thee the
name that has been given Him for the time: it is Jesus the Christ. And Misdæus says: I have been in no hurry
to put thee to death, but have restrained myself; but thou hast made a display of thy works, so that thy sorceries
have been heard of in every country. But no; I shall bring thee to an end, that thy sorceries may be destroyed,</note>

<pb n="1638"/>
<p>At the command of King Misdeus2395 the blessed Apostle Thomas was cast into prison;
and he said: I glorify God, and I shall preach the word to the prisoners, so that all rejoiced
at his presence. When, therefore, Juzanes the king’s son, and Tertia his mother, and Mygdonia,
and Markia, had become believers, but were not yet thought worthy of baptism, they
took it exceedingly ill that the blessed one had been shut up. And having come to the prison,
and given much money to the jailor,2396 they went in to him. And he, seeing them, was
glad, and glorified the Lord, and blessed them. And they entreated and begged the seal in
the Lord, a beautiful young man having appeared to them in a dream, and ordered the
apostle into the house of Juzanes.</p>
<p>And again the beautiful young man coming to them and Thomas, bade them do this
on the coming night. And he ran before them, and gave them light on the way, and without
noise opened the doors that had been secured, until all the mystery was completed. And
having made them communicate in the Eucharist, and having talked much with them, and
confirmed them in the faith, and commended them to the Lord, he went forth thence,
leaving the women, and again went to be shut up.2397 And they grieved and wept because
Misdeus the king was to kill him.</p>
<p>And Thomas went and found the jailors fighting, and saying: What wrong have we
done to that sorcerer, that, availing himself of his magic art, he has opened the doors of the
prison, and wishes to set all the prisoners free? But let us go and let the king know about
<note type="footnote">and our nation purified. And Thomas said: What thou callest sorceries shall abound in me, and never be removed
from the people here. And after this was said, Misdeus reflected in what manner he should put the apostle to
death, for he was afraid of the people standing by who believed. And he arose and took Thomas outside of the
city; and he was accompanied by a few armed soldiers. And the multitude suspected that the king was plotting
about him, and stood and addressed themselves to him. And when they had gone forth three stadia, he delivered
him to four soldiers and one of the polemarchs, and ordered them to spear him on the mountain; and he returned
to the city. And those who were present ran to Thomas, eager to rescue him. And he was led away, accompanied
by the soldiers, two on each side....And Thomas, walking along, said: O Thy secret mysteries, O Jesus! for even
unto the end of life are they fulfilled in us. O the riches of Thy grace!....for, lo, how four have laid hold of me,
since of four elements....(Here the fragment ends.) [Thems. in which this occurs is not that one which has been
so frequently cited in the preceding Apocryphal Acts.—R.]</note>

<note type="footnote">2396 Abdias: Treptia, who was the king’s wife, and Mygdonia the wife of Charisius, one of the king’s friends,

his wife and his son.2398 And when he came they stripped him, and girded him with a girdle;
and thus they stood before the king.</p>
<p>And Misdeus said to him: Art thou a slave, or a freeman? And Thomas answered and
said to him: I am not2399 a slave, and thou hast no power against me at all. And how, said
Misdeus, hast thou run away and come to this country? And Thomas said: I came here
that I might save many, and that I might by thy hands depart from this body. Misdeus says
to him: Who is thy master? and what is his name? and of what country, and of whom is
he? My Lord, says Thomas, is my Master and thine, being the Lord of heaven and earth.
And Misdeus said: What is he called? And Thomas said: Thou canst not know His true
name at this time; but I tell thee the name that has been given Him for a season—Jesus the
Christ. And Misdeus said: I have not been in a hurry2400 to destroy thee, but have restrained
myself; but thou hast made a display of works, so that thy sorceries have been heard of in
all the country. But now this will I do,2401 that thy sorceries may also perish with thee, that
our nation may be purified from them. And Thomas said: Dost thou call these things which
will follow me sorceries? They shall never be removed from the people here.</p>
<p>And while these things were saying, Misdeus was considering in what manner he should
put him to death; for he was afraid of the multitude standing round, many, even some of
the chief men, having believed in him. And he arose, and took Thomas outside of the city;
and a few soldiers accompanied him with their arms. And the rest of the multitude thought
that the king was wishing to learn something from him; and they stood and observed him
closely. And when they had gone forth three stadia, he delivered him to four soldiers, and
to one of the chief officers,2402 and ordered them to take him up into the mountain and
spear him; but he himself returned to the city.</p>
<p>And those present ran to Thomas, eager to rescue him; but he was led away by the soldiers
who were with him. For there were two on each side having hold of him, because of
sorcery. And the chief officer held him by the hand, and led him with honour. And at the
same time the blessed apostle said: O the hidden mysteries of Thee, O Lord! for even to the
close of life is fulfilled in us the riches of Thy grace, which does not allow us to be without
feeling as to the body. For, behold, four have laid hold of me, and one leads me, since I belong
to One, to whom I am going always invisibly. But now I learn that my Lord also, since He

was a stranger, to whom I am going, who also is always present with me invisibly, was struck
by one; but I am struck by four.2403</p>
<p>And when they came to that place where they were to spear him, Thomas spoke thus
to those spearing him: Hear me now, at least, when I am departing from my body; and let
not your eyes be darkened in understanding, nor your ears shut up so as not to hear those
things in which you have believed the God whom I preach, after being delivered in your
souls from rashness; and behave in a manner becoming those who are free, being void of
human glory, and live the life towards God. And he said to Juzanes: Son of an earthly king,
but servant of Jesus Christ, give what is due to those who are to fulfil the command2404 of
Misdeus, in order that I may go apart from them and pray. And Juzanes having paid the
soldiers, the apostle betook himself to prayer; and it was as follows:—</p>
<p>My Lord, and my God, and hope, and leader, and guide in all countries, I follow Thee
along with all that serve Thee, and do Thou guide me this day on my way to Thee. Let no
one take my soul, which Thou hast given to me. Let not publicans and beggars look upon
me, nor let serpents slander me, and let not the children of the dragon hiss at me. Behold,
I have fulfilled Thy work, and accomplished what Thou gavest me to do. I have become a
slave, that I might receive freedom from Thee; do then give it to me, and make me perfect.
And this I say not wavering, but that they may hear who need to hear. I glorify Thee in all,
Lord and Master; for to Thee is due glory for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>And when he had prayed, he said to the soldiers: Come and finish the work of him that
sent you. And the four struck him at once, and killed him. And all the brethren wept, and
wrapped him up in beautiful shawls, and many linen cloths, and laid him in the tomb in
which of old the kings used to be buried.</p>
<p>And Syphor and Juzanes did not go to the city, but spent the whole day there, and waited
during the night. And Thomas appeared to them, and said: I am not there; why do you sit
watching? for I have gone up, and received the things I hoped for; but rise up and walk, and
after no long time you shall be brought beside me. And Misdeus and Charisius2405 greatly
afflicted Tertia and Mygdonia, but did not persuade them to abandon their opinions. And
Thomas appeared, and said to them: Forget not the former things, for the holy and sanctifying
Jesus Himself will aid you. And Misdeus and Charisius, when they could not persuade

them not to be of this opinion, granted them their own will. And all the brethren assembled
together, for the blessed one had made Syphorus2406 a presbyter in the mountain, and
Juzanius2407 a deacon, when he was led away to die. And the Lord helped them, and increased
the faith by means of them.</p>
<p>And after a long time, it happened that one of the sons of Misdeus was a demoniac; and
the demon being stubborn, no one was able to heal him. And Misdeus considered, and
said: I shall go and open the tomb, and take a bone of the apostle’s body, and touch my son
with it, and I know that he will be healed. And he went to do what he had thought of. And
the blessed apostle appeared to him, and said: Thou didst not believe in me when alive;
how wilt thou believe in me when I am dead? Fear not. Jesus Christ is kindly disposed to
thee, through His great clemency. And Misdeus, when he did not find the bones (for one
of the brethren had taken them, and carried them into the regions of the West2408), took
some dust from where the bones had lain, and touched his son with it, and said: I believe
in Thee, Jesus, now when he has left me who always afflicts men, that they may not look to
Thy light which giveth understanding, O Lord, kind to men. And his son being healed in
this manner, he met with the rest of the brethren who were under the rule of Syphorus, and
entreated the brethren to pray for him, that he might obtain mercy from our Lord Jesus
Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Martyrdom of the Holy and Glorious Apostle Bartholomew.</head>
<p>Historians declare that India is divided into three parts; and the first is said to end at
Ethiopia, and the second at Media, and the third completes the country; and the one portion
of it ends in the dark, and the other in the ocean. To this India, then, the holy Bartholomew
the apostle of Christ went, and took up his quarters in the temple of Astaruth, and lived
there as one of the pilgrims and the poor. In this temple, then, there was an idol called Astaruth,
which was supposed to heal the infirm, but rather the more injured all. And the
people were in entire ignorance of the true God; and from want of knowledge, but rather
from the difficulty of going to any other, they all fled for refuge to the false god. And he
brought upon them troubles, infirmities, damage, violence, and much affliction; and when
any one sacrificed to him, the demon, retiring, appeared to give a cure to the person in
trouble; and the foolish people, seeing this, believed in him. But the demons retired, not
because they wished to cure men, but that they might the more assail them, and rather have
them altogether in their power; and thinking that they were cured bodily, those that sacrificed
to them were the more diseased in soul.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that while the holy apostle of Christ, Bartholomew, stayed there,
Astaruth gave no response, and was not able for curing. And when the temple was full of
sick persons, who sacrificed to him daily, Astaruth could give no response; and sick persons
who had come from far countries were lying there. When, therefore, in that temple not
even one of the idols was able to give a response, and was of benefit neither to those that
sacrificed to them nor to those who were in the agonies of death on their account, they were
compelled to go to another city, where there was a temple of idols, where their great and
most eminent god was called Becher.2409 And having there sacrificed, they demanded,
asking why their god Astaruth had not responded to them. And the demon Becher answered
and said to them: From the day and hour that the true God, who dwelleth in the heavens,
sent his apostle Bartholomew into the regions here, your god Astaruth is held fast by chains
of fire, and can no longer either speak or breathe. They said to him: And who is this
Bartholomew? He answered: He is the friend of the Almighty God, and has just come into
these parts, that he may take away all the worship of the idols in the name of his God. And
the servants of the Greeks said to him: Tell us what he is like, that we may be able to find
him.</p>
<note type="footnote">2409 The history of Abdias gives the name as Berith, after Judg. ix. 46.</note>

<pb n="1643"/>
<p>And the demon answered and said: He has black hair, a shaggy head, a fair skin,2410
large eyes, beautiful nostrils, his ears hidden by the hair of his head, with a yellow beard, a
few grey hairs, of middle height, and neither tall nor stunted, but middling, clothed with a
white undercloak bordered with purple, and upon his shoulders a very white cloak; and his
clothes have been worn twenty-six years, but neither are they dirty, nor have they waxed
old. Seven times2411 a day he bends the knee to the Lord, and seven times2412 a night does
he pray to God. His voice is like the sound of a strong trumpet; there go along with him
angels of God, who allow him neither to be weary, nor to hunger, nor to thirst; his face, and
his soul, and his heart are always glad and rejoicing; he foresees everything, he knows and
speaks every tongue of every nation. And behold now, as soon as you ask me, and I answer
you about him, behold, he knows; for the angels of the Lord tell him; and if you wish to seek
him, if he is willing he will appear to you; but if he shall not be willing, you will not be able
to find him. I entreat you, therefore, if you shall find him, entreat him not to come here,
lest his angels do to me as they have done to my brother Astaruth.</p>
<p>And when the demon had said this, he held his peace. And they returned, and set to
work to look into every face of the pilgrims and poor men, and for two days they could find
him nowhere. And it came to pass, that one who was a demoniac set to work to cry out:
Apostle of the Lord, Bartholomew, thy prayers are burning me up. Then said the apostle
to him: Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And that very hour, the man who had suffered

<p>And Polymius, the king of that country, happened to be standing opposite the apostle;
and he had a daughter a demoniac, that is to say, a lunatic. And he heard about the demoniac
that had been healed, and sent messengers to the apostle, saying: My daughter is grievously
torn; I implore thee, therefore, as thou hast delivered him2413 who suffered for many years,
so also to order my daughter to be set free. And the apostle rose up, and went with them.
And he sees the king’s daughter bound with chains, for she used to tear in pieces all her
limbs; and if any one came near her, she used to bite, and no one dared to come near her.
The servants say to him: And who is it that dares to touch her? The apostle answered them:
Loose her, and let her go. They say to him again: We have her in our power when she is
bound with all our force, and dost thou bid us loose her? The apostle says to them: Behold,
I keep her enemy bound, and are you even now afraid of her? Go and loose her; and when
she has partaken of food, let her rest, and early to-morrow bring her to me. And they went

and did as the apostle had commanded them; and thereafter the demon was not able to
come near her.</p>
<p>Then the king loaded camels with gold and silver, precious stones, pearls, and clothing,
and sought to see the apostle; and having made many efforts, and not found him, he brought
everything back to his palace.</p>
<p>And it happened, when the night had passed, and the following day was dawning, the
sun having risen, the apostle appeared alone with the king in his bed-chamber, and said to
him: Why didst thou seek me yesterday the whole day with gold and silver, and precious
stones, pearls, and raiment? For these gifts those persons long for who seek earthly things;
but I seek nothing earthly, nothing carnal. Wherefore I wish to teach thee that the Son of
God deigned to be born as a man out of a virgin’s womb. He was conceived in the womb
of the virgin; He took to Himself her who was always a virgin, having within herself Him
who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that therein is. He, born of a virgin,
like mankind, took to Himself a beginning in time, He who has a beginning neither of times
nor days; but He Himself made every beginning, and everything created, whether in things
visible or invisible. And as this virgin did not know man, so she, preserving her virginity,
vowed a vow2414 to the Lord God. And she was the first who did so. For, from the time
that man existed from the beginning of the world, no woman made a vow of this mode of
life; but she, as she was the first among women who loved this in her heart, said, I offer to
Thee, O Lord, my virginity. And, as I have said to thee, none of mankind dared to speak
this word; but she being called for the salvation of many, observed this—that she might remain
a virgin through the love of God, pure and undefiled. And suddenly, when she was
shut up in her chamber, the archangel Gabriel appeared, gleaming like the sun; and when
she was terrified at the sight, the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour
in the sight of the Lord, and thou shalt conceive. And she cast off fear, and stood up, and
said, How shall this be to me, since I know not man? The angel answered her, The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee;
wherefore also that holy thing which is born of thee shall be called Son of God.2415 Thus,
therefore, when the angel had departed from her, she escaped the temptation of the devil,
who deceived the first man when at rest. For, having tasted of the tree of disobedience,
when the woman said to him, Eat, he ate; and thus the first man was cast out of paradise,
and banished to this life. From him have been born the whole human race. Then the Son
of God having been born of the virgin, and having become perfect man, and having been
baptized, and after His baptism having fasted forty days, the tempter came and said to Him:
<note type="footnote">2414 Or, prayed a prayer.</note>
<note type="footnote">2415 Comp. Luke i. 26–38. Abdias goes on: He then, after His birth, suffered Himself to be tempted by that
devil who had overcome the first man, persuading him to eat of the tree forbidden by God.</note>

<pb n="1645"/>
If thou art the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves. And He answered: Not on
bread alone shall man live, but by every word of God.2416 Thus therefore the devil, who
through eating had conquered the first man, was conquered through the fasting of the second
man; and as he through want of self-restraint had conquered the first man, the son of the
virgin earth, so we shall conquer through the fasting of the second Adam, the Son of the
Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The king says to him: And how is it that thou saidst just now that she was the first virgin
of whom was born God and man? And the apostle answered: I give thanks to the Lord that
thou hearest me gladly. The first man, then, was called Adam; he was formed out of the
earth. And the earth, his mother out of which he was, was virgin, because it had neither
been polluted by the blood of man nor opened for the burial of any one. The earth, then,
was like the virgin, in order that he who conquered the son of the virgin earth might be
conquered by the Son of the Virgin Mary. And, behold, he did conquer; for his wicked craft,
through the eating of the tree by which man, being deceived, came forth from paradise, kept
paradise shut. Thereafter this Son of the virgin conquered all the craft of the devil. And his
craft was such, that when he saw the Son of the virgin fasting forty days, he knew in truth
that He was the true God. The true God and man, therefore, hath not given Himself out to
be known, except to those who are pure in heart,2417 and who serve Him by good works.
The devil himself, therefore, when he saw that after the forty days He was again hungry,
was deceived into thinking that He was not God, and said to Him, Why hast thou been
hungry? tell these stones to become loaves, and eat. And the Lord answered him, Listen,
devil; although thou mayst lord it over man, because he has not kept the commandment of
God. I have fulfilled the righteousness of God in having fasted, and shall destroy thy power,
so that thou shalt no longer lord it over man. And when he saw himself conquered, he again
takes Jesus to an exceeding high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world,
and says, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. The Lord says to
him, Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve. And there was a third temptation for the Lord; for he takes Him
up to the pinnacle of the temple, and says, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down.
The Lord says to him, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And the devil disappeared.
And he indeed that once conquered Adam, the son of the virgin earth, was thrice conquered
by Christ, the Son of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>And when the Lord had conquered the tyrant, He sent His apostles into all the world,
that He might redeem His people from the deception of the devil; and one of these I am, an
apostle of Christ. On this account we seek not after gold and silver, but rather despise them,
<note type="footnote">2416 Comp. Luke iv. 1–13.</note>
<note type="footnote">2417 Matt. v. 8.</note>

<pb n="1646"/>
because we labour to be rich in that place where the kingdom of Him alone endureth2418
for ever, where neither trouble, nor grief, nor groaning, nor death, has place; where there
is eternal blessedness, and ineffable joy, and everlasting exultation, and perpetual repose.
Wherefore also the demon sitting in your temple, who makes responses to you, is kept in
chains through the angel of the Lord who has sent me. Because if thou shalt be baptized,
and wishest thyself to be enlightened, I will make thee behold Him, and learn from how
great evils thou hast been redeemed. At the same time hear also by what means he injures
all those who are lying sick in the temple. The devil himself by his own art causes the men
to be sick, and again to be healed, in order that they may the more believe in the idols, and
in order that he may have place the more in their souls, in order that they may say to the
stock and the stone, Thou art our God.2419 But that demon who dwells in the idol is held
in subjection, conquered by me, and is able to give no response to those who sacrifice and
pray there. And if thou wishest to prove that it is so, I order him to return into the idol, and
I will make him confess with his own mouth that he is bound, and able to give no response.</p>
<p>The king says to him: To-morrow, at the first hour of the day, the priests are ready to
sacrifice in the temple, and I shall come there, and shall be able to see this wonderful work.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the following day, as they were sacrificing, the devil began to
cry out: Refrain, ye wretched ones, from sacrificing to me, lest ye suffer worse for my sake;
because I am bound in fiery chains, and kept in subjection by an angel of the Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, whom the Jews crucified: for, being afraid of him, they condemned
him to death. And he put to death Death himself, our king, and he bound our prince in
chains of fire; and on the third day, having conquered death and the devil, rose in glory,
and gave the sign of the cross to his apostles, and sent them out into the four quarters of the
world; and one of them is here just now, who has bound me, and keeps me in subjection.
I implore you, therefore, supplicate him on my account, that he may set me free to go into
other habitations.</p>
<p>Then the apostle answered: Confess, unclean demon, who is it that has injured all those
that are lying here from heavy diseases? The demon answered: The devil, our ruler, he who
is bound, he sends us against men, that, having first injured their bodies, we may thus also
make an assault upon their souls when they sacrifice to us. For then we have complete
power over them, when they believe in us and sacrifice to us. And when, on account of the
mischief done to them, we retire, we appear curing them, and are worshipped by them as
gods; but in truth we are demons, and the servants of him who was crucified, the Son of the
virgin, have bound us. For from that day on which the Apostle Bartholomew came I am
punished, kept bound in chains of fire. And for this reason I speak, because he has com-

manded me. At the same time, I dare not utter more when the apostle is present, neither I
nor our rulers.</p>
<p>The apostle says to him: Why dost thou not save all that have come to thee? The demon
says to him: When we injure their bodies, unless we first injure their souls, we do not let
their bodies go. The apostle says to him: And how do you injure their souls? The demon
answered him: When they believe that we are gods, and sacrifice to us, God withdraws from
those who sacrifice, and we do not take away the sufferings of their bodies, but retire into
their souls.</p>
<p>Then the apostle says to the people: Behold, the god whom you thought to cure you,
does the more mischief to your souls and bodies. Hear even now your Maker who dwells
in the heavens, and do not believe in lifeless stones and stocks. And if you wish that I should
pray for you, and that all these may receive health, take down this idol, and break it to pieces;
and when you have done this, I will sanctify this temple in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
and having baptized all of you who are in it in the baptism of the Lord, and sanctified you,
I will save all.</p>
<p>Then the king gave orders, and all the people brought ropes and crowbars, and were
not at all able to take down the idol. Then the apostle says to them: Unfasten the ropes.
And when they had unfastened them, he said to the demon dwelling in it: In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, come out of this idol, and go into a desert place, where neither winged
creature utters a cry, nor voice of man has ever been heard. And straightway he arose at
the word of the apostle, and lifted it up from its foundations; and in that same hour all the
idols that were in that place were broken to pieces.</p>
<p>Then all cried out with one voice, saying: He alone is God Almighty whom Bartholomew
the apostle proclaims. Then the holy Bartholomew, having spread forth his hands to heaven,
said: God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, who for the salvation of men hast sent
forth Thine only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, in order that He might redeem by
His own blood all of us enslaved by sin, and declare us to be Thy sons, that we may know
Thee, the true God, that Thou existest always to eternity God without end: one God, the
Father, acknowledged in Son and Holy Spirit; one God, the Son, glorified in Father and
Holy Spirit; one God, the Holy Spirit, worshipped in Father and Son; and acknowledged to
be truly one,2420 the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the Holy Spirit proceeding; and
in Thee the Father, and in the Holy Spirit, Thine only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ
is, in whose name Thou hast given us power to heal the sick, to cure paralytics, to expel
demons, and raise the dead: for He said to us, Verily I say unto you, that whatever ye shall
ask in my name ye shall receive.2421 I entreat, then, that in His name all this multitude may
<note type="footnote">2420 Or, unity.</note>
<note type="footnote">2421 Matt. xxi. 22.</note>

<pb n="1648"/>
be saved, that all may know that Thou alone art God in heaven, and in the earth, and in the
sea, who seekest the salvation of men through that same Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom
Thou livest and reignest in unity of the Holy Spirit for ever and ever.</p>
<p>And when all responded to the Amen, suddenly there appeared an angel of the Lord,
shining brighter than the sun, winged, and other four angels holding up the four corners of
the temple; and with his finger the one sealed the temple and the people, and said: Thus
saith the Lord who hath sent me, As you have all been purified from all your infirmity, so
also this temple shall be purified from all uncleanness, and from the demons dwelling in it,
whom the apostle of God has ordered to go into a desert place; for so hath God commanded
me, that I may manifest Him to you. And when ye behold Him, fear nothing; but when I
make the sign of the cross, so also do ye with your finger seal your faces, and these evil things
will flee from you. Then he showed them the demon who dwelt in the temple, like an
Ethiopian, black as soot; his face sharp like a dog’s, thin-cheeked, with hair down to his feet,
eyes like fire, sparks coming out of his mouth; and out of his nostrils came forth smoke like
sulphur, with wings spined like a porcupine; and his hands were bound with fiery chains,
and he was firmly kept in. And the angel of the Lord said to him: As also the apostle hath
commanded, I let thee go; go where voice of man is not heard, and be there until the great
day of judgment. And when he let him go, he flew away, groaning and weeping, and disappeared.
And the angel of the Lord went up into heaven in the sight of all.</p>
<p>Then the king, and also the queen, with their two sons, and with all his people, and with
all the multitude of the city, and every city round about, and country, and whatever land
his kingdom ruled over, were saved, and believed, and were baptized in the name of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And the king laid aside his diadem, and followed
Bartholomew the apostle of Christ.</p>
<p>And after these things the unbelievers of the Greeks, having come together to Astreges2422
the king, who was the elder brother of the king who had been baptized, say to
him: O king, thy brother Polymius has become disciple to a certain magician, who has taken
down our temples, and broken our gods to pieces. And while they were thus speaking and
weeping, behold, again there came also some others from the cities round about, both
priests2423 and people; and they set about weeping and making accusations2424 before the
king. Then King Astreges in a rage sent a thousand armed men along with those priests, in
order that, wherever they should find the apostle, they might bring him to him bound. And
when they had done so, and found him, and brought him, he says to him: Art thou he who
has perverted my brother from the gods? To whom the apostle answered: I have not per-

verted him, but have converted him to God. The king says to him: Art thou he who caused
our gods to be broken in pieces? The apostle says to him: I gave power to the demons who
were in them, and they broke in pieces the dumb and senseless idols, that all men might
believe in God Almighty, who dwelleth in the heavens. The king says to him: As thou hast
made my brother deny his gods, and believe in thy God, so I also will make you reject thy
God and believe in my gods. The apostle says to him: If I have bound and kept in subjection
the god which thy brother worshipped, and at my order the idols were broken in pieces, if
thou also art able to do the same to my God, thou canst persuade me also to sacrifice to thy
gods; but if thou canst do nothing to my God, I will break all thy gods in pieces; but do thou
believe in my God.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the king was informed that this god Baldad2425 and all
the other idols had fallen down, and were broken in pieces. Then the king rent the purple
in which he was clothed, and ordered the holy apostle Bartholomew to be beaten with rods;
and after having been thus scourged, to be beheaded.</p>
<p>And innumerable multitudes came from all the cities, to the number of twelve thousand,
who had believed in him along with the king; and they took up the remains of the apostle
with singing of praise and with all glory, and they laid them in the royal tomb, and glorified
God. And the king Astreges having heard of this, ordered him to be thrown into the sea;
and his remains were carried into the island of Liparis.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the thirtieth day after the apostle was carried away, that the king
Astreges was overpowered by a demon and miserably strangled; and all the priests were
strangled by demons, and perished on account of their rising against2426 the apostle, and
thus died by an evil fate.</p>
<p>And there was great fear and trembling, and all came to the Lord, and were baptized by
the presbyters who had been ordained by the holy apostle Bartholomew. And according to
the commandment of the apostle, all the clergy of the people made King Polymius bishop;
and in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ he received the grace of healing, and began to do
signs. And he remained in the bishopric twenty years; and having prospered in all things,
and governed the church well, and guided it in right opinions,2427 he fell asleep in peace,
and went to the Lord: to whom be glory and strength for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Acts of the Holy Apostle Thaddæus,
One of the Twelve.2428</head>
<p>Lebbæus, who also is Thaddæus, was of the city of Edessa—and it is the metropolis of
Osroene, in the interior of the Armenosyrians—an Hebrew by race, accomplished and most
learned in the divine writings. He came to Jerusalem to worship in the days of John the
Baptist; and having heard his preaching and seen his angelic life, he was baptized, and his
name was called Thaddæus. And having seen the appearing of Christ, and His teaching,
and His wonderful works, he followed Him, and became His disciple; and He chose him as
one of the twelve, the tenth apostle according to the Evangelists Matthew and Mark.</p>
<p>In those times there was a governor of the city of Edessa, Abgarus by name. And there
having gone abroad the fame of Christ, of the wonders which He did, and of His teaching,
Abgarus having heard of it, was astonished, and desired to see Christ, and could not leave
his city and government. And about the days of the Passion and the plots of the Jews,
Abgarus, being seized by an incurable disease, sent a letter to Christ by Ananias the courier,
2429 to the following effect:—To Jesus2430 called Christ, Abgarus the governor of the
country of the Edessenes, an unworthy slave. The multitude of the wonders done by thee
has been heard of by me, that thou healest the blind, the lame, and the paralytic, and curest
all the demoniacs; and on this account I entreat thy goodness to come even to us, and escape
from the plottings of the wicked Jews, which through envy they set in motion against thee.
My city is small, but large enough for both. Abgarus enjoined Ananias to take accurate account
of Christ, of what appearance He was, and His stature, and His hair, and in a word
everything.</p>
<p>And Ananias, having gone and given the letter, was carefully looking at Christ, but was
unable to fix Him in his mind. And He knew as knowing the heart, and asked to wash
Himself; and a towel2431 was given Him; and when He had washed Himself, He wiped His
face with it. And His image having been imprinted upon the linen, He gave it to Ananias,
saying: Give this, and take back this message, to him that sent thee: Peace to thee and thy
city! For because of this I am come, to suffer for the world, and to rise again, and to raise

up the forefathers. And after I have been taken up into the heavens I shall send thee my
disciple Thaddæus, who shall enlighten thee, and guide thee into all the truth, both thee
and thy city.</p>
<p>And having received Ananias, and fallen down and adored the likeness, Abgarus was
cured of his disease before Thaddæus came.</p>
<p>And after the passion, and the resurrection, and the ascension, Thaddæus went to
Abgarus; and having found him in health, he gave him an account of the incarnation of
Christ, and baptized him, with all his house. And having instructed great multitudes, both
of Hebrews and Greeks, Syrians and Armenians, he baptized them in the name of the
Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, having anointed them with the holy perfume; and he
communicated to them of the undefiled mysteries of the sacred body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and delivered to them to keep and observe the law of Moses, and to give close
heed to the things that had been said by the apostles in Jerusalem. For year by year they
came together to the passover, and again he imparted to them the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And Thaddæus along with Abgarus destroyed idol-temples and built churches; ordained
as bishop one of his disciples, and presbyters, and deacons, and gave them the rule of the
psalmody and the holy liturgy. And having left them, he went to the city of Amis, great
metropolis of the Mesechaldeans and Syrians, that is, of Mesopotamia-Syria, beside the river
Tigris. And he having gone into the synagogue of the Jews along with his disciples on the
Sabbath-day, after the reading of the law the high priest said to Thaddæus and his disciples:
Men, whence are you? and why are you here?</p>
<p>And Thaddæus said: No doubt you have heard of what has taken place in Jerusalem
about Jesus Christ, and we are His disciples, and witnesses of the wonderful things which
He did and taught, and how through hatred the chief priests delivered Him to Pilate the
procurator of Judæa. And Pilate, having examined Him and found no case,2432 wished to
let Him go; but they cried out, If thou let him go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend, because he
proclaims himself king. And he being afraid, washed his hands in the sight of the multitude,
and said, I am innocent of the blood of this man; see ye to it. And the chief priests answered
and said, His blood be upon us and our children. And Pilate gave him up to them. And
they took Him, and spit upon Him, with the soldiers, and made a great mock of Him, and
crucified Him, and laid Him in the tomb, and secured it well, having also set guards upon
Him. And on the third day before dawn He rose, leaving His burial-clothes in the tomb.
And He was seen first by His mother and other women, and by Peter and John first of my
fellow disciples, and thereafter to us the twelve, who ate and drank with Him after His resurrection
for many days. And He sent us in His name to proclaim repentance and remission
of sins to all the nations, that those who were baptized, having had the kingdom of the

heavens preached to them, would rise up incorruptible at the end of this age; and He gave
us power to expel demons, and heal every disease and every malady, and raise the dead.</p>
<p>And the multitudes having heard this, brought together their sick and demoniacs. And
Thaddæus, having gone forth along with his disciples, laid his hand upon each one of them,
and healed them all by calling upon the name of Christ. And the demoniacs were healed
before Thaddæus came near them, the spirits going out of them. And for many days the
people ran together from different places, and beheld what was done by Thaddæus. And
hearing his teaching, many believed, and were baptized, confessing their sins.</p>
<p>Having therefore remained with them for five years, he built a church; and having appointed
as bishop one of his disciples, and presbyters, and deacons, and prayed for them,
he went away, going round the cities of Syria, and teaching, and healing all the sick; whence
he brought many cities and countries to Christ through His teaching. Teaching, therefore,
and evangelizing along with the disciples, and healing the sick, he went to Berytus, a city of
Phoenicia by the sea;2433 and there, having taught and enlightened many, he fell asleep on
the twenty-first2434 of the month of August. And the disciples having come together, buried
him with great honour; and many sick were healed, and they gave glory to the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<note type="footnote">2433 The other [Vienna] ms. here adds: And having gone into it, he preached Christ, saying to them all with
tears, Ye men who have ears to hear, hear from me the word of life; hear attentively, and understand. Cast off
your many opinions, and believe and come to the one living and true God, the God of the Hebrews. For He
only is the true God and Maker of the whole creation, searching the hearts of mankind, and knowing all about
each one before their birth, as being the Maker of them all. To Him alone, fixing your eyes upon heaven, fall
down evening and morning, and at noon, and to Him alone offer the sacrifice of praise, and give thanks always,
refraining from what you yourselves hate; because God is compassionate and benevolent, and recompenses to
each one according to his works.</note>

<head>Acts of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian.</head>
<head>About His Exile and Departure.</head>
<p>When Agrippa, whom, on account of his plotting against Peace, they stoned and put to
death, was king of the Jews, Vespasian Cæsar, coming with a great army, invested Jerusalem;
and some prisoners of war he took and slew, others he destroyed by famine in the siege, and
most he banished, and at length scattered up and down. And having destroyed the temple,
and put the holy vessels on board a ship, he sent them to Rome, to make for himself a temple
of peace, and adorned it with the spoils of war.</p>
<p>And when Vespasian was dead, his son Domitian, having got possession of the kingdom,
along with his other wrongful acts, set himself also to make a persecution against the righteous
men. For, having learned that the city was filled with Jews, remembering the orders given
by his father about them, he purposed casting them all out of the city of the Romans. And
some of the Jews took courage, and gave Domitian a book, in which was written as follows:—</p>
<p>O Domitian, Cæsar and king of all the world, as many of us as are Jews entreat thee, as
suppliants we beseech of thy power not to banish us from thy divine and benignant countenance;
for we are obedient to thee, and the customs, and laws, and practices, and policy,
doing wrong in nothing, but being of the same mind with the Romans. But there is a new
and strange nation, neither agreeing with other nations nor consenting to the religious observances
of the Jews, uncircumcised, inhuman, lawless, subverting whole houses, proclaiming
a man as God, all assembling together2435 under a strange name, that of Christian. These
men reject God, paying no heed to the law given by Him, and proclaim to be the Son of God
a man born of ourselves, Jesus by name, whose parents and brothers and all his family have
been connected with the Hebrews; whom on account of his great blasphemy and his wicked
fooleries we gave up to the cross. And they add another blasphemous lie to their first one:
him that was nailed up and buried, they glorify as having risen from the dead; and, more
than this, they falsely assert that he has been taken up by2436 clouds into the heavens.</p>
<p>At all this the king, being affected with rage, ordered the senate to publish a decree that
they should put to death all who confessed themselves to be Christians. Those, then, who
were found in the time of his rage, and who reaped the fruit of patience, and were crowned
in the triumphant contest against the works of the devil, received the repose of incorruption.</p>

<p>And the fame of the teaching of John was spread abroad in Rome; and it came to the
ears of Domitian that there was a certain Hebrew in Ephesus, John by name, who spread a
report about the seat of empire of the Romans, saying that it would quickly be rooted out,
and that the kingdom of the Romans would be given over to another. And Domitian,
troubled by what was said, sent a centurion with soldiers to seize John, and bring him. And
having gone to Ephesus, they asked where John lived. And having come up to his gate, they
found him standing before the door; and, thinking that he was the porter, they inquired of
him where John lived. And he answered and said: I am he. And they, despising his common,
and low, and poor appearance, were filled with threats, and said: Tell us the truth. And
when he declared again that he was the man they sought, the neighbours moreover bearing
witness to it, they said that he was to go with them at once to the king in Rome. And, urging
them to take provisions for the journey, he turned and took a few dates, and straightway
went forth.</p>
<p>And the soldiers, having taken the public conveyances, travelled fast, having seated him
in the midst of them. And when they came to the first change, it being the hour of breakfast,
they entreated him to be of good courage, and to take bread, and eat with them. And John
said: I rejoice in soul indeed, but in the meantime I do not wish to take any food. And they
started, and were carried along quickly. And when it was evening they stopped at a certain
inn; and as, besides, it was the hour of supper, the centurion and the soldiers being most
kindly disposed, entreated John to make use of what was set before them. But he said that
he was very tired, and in want of sleep more than any food. And as he did this each day, all
the soldiers were struck with amazement, and were afraid lest John should die, and involve
them in danger. But the Holy Spirit showed him to them as more cheerful. And on the
seventh day, it being the Lord’s day, he said to them: Now it is time for me also to partake
of food. And having washed his hands and face, he prayed, and brought out the linen cloth,
and took one of the dates, and ate it in the sight of all.</p>
<p>And when they had ridden a long time they came to the end of their journey, John thus
fasting. And they brought him before the king, and said: Worshipful king, we bring to thee
John, a god, not a man; for, from the hour in which we apprehended him, to the present,
he has not tasted bread. At this Domitian being amazed, stretched out his mouth on account
of the wonder, wishing to salute him with a kiss; but John bent down his head, and kissed
his breast. And Domitian said: Why hast thou done this? Didst thou not think me worthy
to kiss thee? And John said to him: It is right to adore the hand of God first of all, and in
this way to kiss the mouth of the king; for it is written in the holy books, The heart of a king
is in the hand of God.2437</p>
<note type="footnote">2437 Prov. xxi. 1.</note>

<pb n="1655"/>
<p>And the king said to him: Art thou John, who said that my kingdom would speedily
be uprooted, and that another king, Jesus, was going to reign instead of me? And John
answered and said to him: Thou also shalt reign for many years given thee by God, and
after thee very many others; and when the times of the things upon earth have been fulfilled,
out of heaven shall come a King, eternal, true, Judge of living and dead, to whom every nation
and tribe shall confess, through whom every earthly power and dominion shall be brought
to nothing, and every mouth speaking great things shall be shut. This is the mighty Lord
and King of everything that hath breath and flesh,2438 the Word and Son of the living One,
who is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>At this Domitian said to him: What is the proof of these things? I am not persuaded
by words only; words are a sight of the unseen.2439 What canst thou show in earth or
heaven by the power of him who is destined to reign, as thou sayest? For he will do it, if he
is the Son of God. And immediately John asked for a deadly poison. And the king having
ordered poison to be given to him, they brought it on the instant. John therefore, having
taken it, put it into a large cup, and filled it with water, and mixed it, and cried out with a
loud voice, and said: In Thy name, Jesus Christ, Son of God, I drink the cup which Thou
wilt sweeten; and the poison in it do Thou mingle with Thy Holy Spirit, and make it become
a draught of life and salvation, for the healing of soul and body, for digestion and harmless
assimilation, for faith not to be repented of, for an undeniable testimony of death as the cup
of thanksgiving.2440 And when he had drunk the cup, those standing beside Domitian expected
that he was going to fall to the ground in convulsions. And when John stood,
cheerful, and talked with them safe, Domitian was enraged against those who had given the
poison, as having spared John. But they swore by the fortune and health of the king, and
said that there could not be a stronger poison than this. And John, understanding what
they were whispering to one another, said to the king: Do not take it ill, O king, but let a
trial be made,2441 and thou shalt learn the power of the poison. Make some condemned
criminal be brought from the prison. And when he had come, John put water into the cup,
and swirled it round, and gave it with all the dregs to the condemned criminal. And he,
having taken it and drunk, immediately fell down and died.</p>
<p>And when all wondered at the signs that had been done, and when Domitian had retired
and gone to his palace, John said to him: O Domitian, king of the Romans, didst thou
contrive this, that, thou being present and bearing witness, I might to-day become a murderer?
What is to be done about the dead body which is lying? And he ordered it to be
<note type="footnote">2438 Lit., of all breath and flesh.</note>
<note type="footnote">2439 Equal to our proverb, Seeing is believing.</note>

<note type="footnote">2441 Tischendorf conjectures this clause, as the original is illegible.</note>

<pb n="1656"/>
taken and thrown away. But John, going up to the dead body, said: O God, Maker of the
heavens, Lord and Master of angels, of glories, of powers, in the name of Jesus Christ, Thine
only begotten Son, give to this man who has died for this occasion a renewal of life, and restore
him his soul, that Domitian may learn that the Word is much more powerful than
poison, and is the ruler of life. And having taken him by the hand, he raised him up alive.</p>
<p>And when all were glorifying God, and wondering at the faith of John, Domitian said
to him: I have put forth a decree of the senate, that all such persons should be summarily
dealt with, without trial; but since I find from thee that they are innocent, and that their
religion is rather beneficial, I banish thee to an island, that I may not seem myself to do
away with my own decrees. He asked then that the condemned criminal should be let go;
and when he was let go, John said: Depart, give thanks to God, who has this day delivered
thee from prison and from death.</p>
<p>And while they were standing, a certain home-born slave of Domitian’s, of those in the
bed-chamber, was suddenly seized by the unclean demon, and lay dead; and word was
brought to the king. And the king was moved, and entreated John to help her. And John
said: It is not in man to do this; but since thou knowest how to reign, but dost not know
from whom thou hast received it, learn who has the power over both thee and thy kingdom.
And he prayed thus: O Lord, the God of every kingdom, and master of every creature, give
to this maiden the breath of life. And having prayed, he raised her up. And Domitian, astonished
at all the wonders, sent him away to an island, appointing for him a set time.</p>
<p>And straightway John sailed to Patmos, where also he was deemed worthy to see the
revelation of the end. And when Domitian was dead, Nerva succeeded to the kingdom, and
recalled all who had been banished; and having kept the kingdom for a year, he made Trajan
his successor in the kingdom. And when he was king over the Romans, John went to Ephesus,
and regulated all the teaching of the church, holding many conferences, and reminding
them of what the Lord had said to them, and what duty he had assigned to each. And when
he was old and changed, he ordered Polycarp to be bishop over the church.</p>
<p>And what like his end was, or his departure from men, who cannot give an account of?
For on the following day, which was the Lord’s day, and in the presence of the brethren, he
began to say to them: Brethren, and fellow-servants, and co-heirs, and copartners of the
kingdom of the Lord, know the Lord what miracles He hath shown you through me, what
wonders, what cures, what signs, what gracious gifts, teachings, rulings, rests, services,
glories, graces, gifts, faiths, communions; how many things you have seen with your eyes,
that ear hath not heard. Be strong, therefore, in Him, remembering Him in all your doings,
knowing the mystery of the dispensation that has come to men, for the sake of which the
Lord has worked. He then, through me, exhorts you: Brethren, I wish to remain without
grief, without insult, without treachery, without punishment. For He also knows insult
from you, He knows also dishonour, He knows also treachery, He knows also punishment

<pb n="1657"/>
from those that disobey His commandments. Let not therefore our God be grieved, the
good, the compassionate, the merciful, the holy, the pure, the undefiled, the only, the one,
the immutable, the sincere, the guileless, the slow to anger, He that is higher and more exalted
than every name that we speak or think of—our God, Jesus Christ. Let Him rejoice along
with us because we conduct ourselves well; let Him be glad because we live in purity; let
Him rest because we behave reverently; let Him be pleased because we live in fellowship;
let Him smile because we are sober-minded; let Him be delighted because we love. These
things, brethren, I communicate to you, pressing on to the work set before me, already
perfected for me by the Lord. For what else have I to say to you? Keep the sureties of your
God; keep His presence, that shall not be taken away from you. And if then ye sin no more,
He will forgive you what ye have done in ignorance; but if, after ye have known Him, and
He has had compassion upon you, you return to the like courses, even your former offences
will be laid to your charge, and ye shall have no portion or compassion before His face.2442</p>
<p>And when he had said this to them, he thus prayed: Jesus, who didst wreathe this crown
by Thy twining, who hast inserted these many flowers into the everlasting flower of Thy
countenance, who hast sown these words among them, be Thou Thyself the protector and
healer of Thy people. Thou alone art benignant and not haughty, alone merciful and kind,
alone a Saviour, and just; Thou who always seest what belongs to all, and art in all, and
everywhere present, God Lord Jesus Christ; who with Thy gifts and Thy compassion coverest
those that hope in Thee; who knowest intimately those that everywhere speak against us,
and blaspheme Thy holy name, do Thou alone, O Lord, help Thy servants with Thy
watchful care. So be it, Lord.</p>
<p>And having asked bread, he gave thanks thus, saying: What praise, or what sort of offering,
or what thanksgiving, shall we, breaking the bread, invoke, but Thee only? We
glorify the name by which Thou hast been called by the Father; we glorify the name by which
Thou hast been called through the Son; we glorify the resurrection which has been manifested
to us through Thee; of Thee we glorify the seed,2443 the word, the grace, the true pearl, the
treasure, the plough, the net,2444 the majesty, the diadem, Him called Son of man for our
sakes, the truth, the rest, the knowledge, the freedom, the place of refuge in Thee. For Thou
alone art Lord, the root of immortality, and the fountain of incorruption, and the seat of
the ages; Thou who hast been called all these for our sakes, that now we, calling upon Thee
through these, may recognise Thine illimitable majesty, presented to us by Thy presence,
that can be seen only by the pure, seen in Thine only Son.</p>

<p>And having broken the bread, he gave it to us, praying for each of the brethren, that he
might be worthy of the Eucharist of the Lord. He also therefore, having likewise tasted it,
said: To me also let there be a portion with you, and peace, O beloved. And having thus
spoken, and confirmed the brethren, he said to Eutyches, also named Verus: Behold, I appoint
thee a minister2445 of the Church of Christ, and I entrust to thee the flock of Christ.
Be mindful, therefore, of the commandments of the Lord; and if thou shouldst fall into trials
or dangers, be not afraid: for thou shalt fall under many troubles, and thou shalt be shown
to be an eminent witness2446 of the Lord. Thus, then, Verus, attend to the flock as a servant
of God, until the time appointed for thy testimony.</p>
<p>And when John had spoken this, and more than this, having entrusted to him the flock
of Christ, he says to him: Take some brethren, with baskets and vessels, and follow me.
And Eutyches, without considering,2447 did what he was bid. And the blessed John having
gone forth from the house, went outside of the gates, having told the multitude to stand off
from him. And having come to the tomb of one of our brethren, he told them to dig. And
they dug. And he says: Let the trench be deeper. And as they dug, he conversed with those
who had come out of the house with him, building them up, and furnishing them thoroughly
into the majesty of the Lord. And when the young men had finished the trench, as he had
wished, while we knew2448 nothing, he takes off the clothes he had on, and throws them,
as if they were some bedding, into the depth of the trench; and, standing in only his drawers,
2449 stretched forth his hands, and prayed.</p>
<p>O God, who hast chosen us for the mission2450 of the Gentiles, who hast sent us out
into the world, who hast declared Thyself through the apostles; who hast never rested, but
always savest from the foundation of the world; who hast made Thyself known through all
nature; who hast made our wild and savage nature quiet and peaceable; who hast given
Thyself to it when thirsting after knowledge;2451 who hast put to death its adversary, when
it took refuge in Thee; who hast given it Thy hand, and raised it from the things done in
Hades; who hast shown it its own enemy; who hast in purity turned its thoughts upon Thee,
O Christ Jesus, Lord of things in heaven, and law of things on earth, the course of things
aerial, and guardian of things etherial, the fear of those under the earth, and grace of Thine
own people, receive also the soul of Thy John, which has been certainly deemed worthy by

Thee, Thou who hast preserved me also till the present hour pure to Thyself, and free from
intercourse with woman; who, when I wished in my youth to marry, didst appear to me,
and say, I am in need of thee, John; who didst strengthen for me beforehand my bodily
weakness; who, when a third time I wished to marry, didst say to me at the third hour, in
the sea, John, if thou wert not mine, I would let thee marry; who hast opened up the sight
of my mind, and hast favoured my bodily2452 eyes; who, when I was looking about me, didst
call even the gazing upon a woman hateful; who didst deliver me from temporary show,
and preserve me for that which endureth for ever; who didst separate me from the filthy
madness of the flesh; who didst stop up2453 the secret disease of the soul, and cut out its
open actions; who didst afflict and banish him who rebelled in me; who didst establish my
love to Thee spotless and unimpaired; who didst give me undoubting faith in Thee; who
hast drawn out for me pure thoughts towards Thee; who hast given me the due reward of
my works; who hast set it in my soul to have no other possession than Thee alone: for what
is more precious than Thou? Now, O Lord, when I have accomplished Thy stewardship
with which I was entrusted, make me worthy of Thy repose, having wrought that which is
perfect in Thee, which is ineffable salvation. And as I go to Thee, let the fire withdraw, let
darkness be overcome, let the furnace be slackened, let Gehenna be extinguished, let the
angels follow, let the demons be afraid, let the princes be broken in pieces, let the powers
of darkness fall, let the places on the right hand stand firm, let those on the left abide not,
let the devil be muzzled, let Satan be laughed to scorn, let his madness be tamed, let his
wrath be broken, let his children be trodden under foot, and let all his root be uprooted;
and grant to me to accomplish the journey to Thee, not insulted, not despitefully treated,
and to receive what Thou hast promised to those that live in purity, and that have loved a
holy life.</p>
<p>And gazing towards heaven, he glorified God; and having sealed himself altogether, he
stood and said to us, Peace and grace be with you, brethren! and sent the brethren away.
And when they went on the morrow they did not find him, but his sandals, and a fountain
welling up. And after that they remembered what had been said to Peter by the Lord about
him: For what does it concern thee if I should wish him to remain until I come?2454 And
they glorified God for the miracle that had happened. And having thus believed, they retired
praising and blessing the benignant God; because to Him is due glory now and ever, and to
ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<head>Revelation of Moses.</head>
<p>Account and life of Adam and Eve, the first-created, revealed by God to His servant
Moses, when he received from the hand of the Lord the tables of the law of the covenant,
instructed by the archangel Michael.</p>
<p>This is the account of Adam and Eve. After they went forth out of paradise, Adam took
Eve his wife, and went up into the east. And he remained there eighteen years and two
months; and Eve conceived and brought forth two sons, Diaphotus called Cain, and Amilabes2455
called Abel.</p>
<p>And after this, Adam and Eve were with one another; and when they lay down, Eve said
to Adam her lord: My lord, I have seen in a dream this night the blood of my son Amilabes,
who is called Abel, thrown into the mouth of Cain his brother, and he drank it without pity.
And he entreated him to grant him a little of it, but he did not listen to him, but drank it all
up; and it did not remain in his belly, but came forth out of his mouth. And Adam said to
Eve: Let us arise, and go and see what has happened to them, lest perchance the enemy
should be in any way warring against them.</p>
<p>And having both gone, they found Abel killed by the hand of Cain his brother. And
God says to the archangel Michael: Say to Adam, Do not relate the mystery which thou
knowest to thy son Cain, for he is a son of wrath. But grieve thyself not; for I will give thee
instead of him another son, who shall show thee all things, as many as thou shalt do to him;
but do thou tell him nothing. This God said to His angel; and Adam kept the word in his
heart, and with him Eve also, having grief about Abel their son.</p>
<p>And after this, Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and brought forth Seth.
And Adam says to Eve: Behold, we have brought forth a son instead of Abel whom Cain
slew; let us give glory and sacrifice to God.</p>
<p>And Adam had2456 thirty sons and thirty daughters.2457 And he fell into disease, and
cried with a loud voice, and said: Let all my sons come to me, that I may see them before I
die. And they were all brought together, for the earth was inhabited in three parts; and they
all came to the door of the house into which he had entered to pray to God. And his son
Seth said: Father Adam, what is thy disease? And he says: My children, great trouble has
hold of me. And they say: What is the trouble and disease? And Seth answered and said
to him: Is it that thou rememberest the fruits of paradise of which thou didst eat, and grievest

thyself because of the desire of them? If it is so, tell me, and I will go and bring thee fruit
from paradise. For I will put dung upon my head, and weep and pray, and the Lord will
hearken to me, and send his angel; and I shall bring it to thee,2458 that thy trouble may cease
from thee. Adam says to him: No, my son Seth; but I have disease and trouble. Seth says
to him: And how have they come upon thee? Adam said to him: When God made us, me
and your mother, for whose sake also I die, He gave us every plant in paradise; but about
one he commanded us not to eat of it, because on account of it we should die. And the hour
was at hand for the angels who guarded your mother to go up and worship the Lord; and
the enemy gave to her, and she ate of the tree, knowing that I was not near her, nor the holy
angels; then she gave me also to eat. And when we had both eaten, God was angry with us.
And the Lord, coming into paradise, set His throne, and called with a dreadful voice, saying,
Adam, where art thou? and why art thou hidden from my face? shall the house be hidden
from him that built it? And He says, Since thou hast forsaken my covenant, I have brought
upon thy body seventy strokes.2459 The trouble of the first stroke is the injury of the eyes;
the trouble of the second stroke, of the hearing; and so in succession, all the strokes shall
overtake thee.</p>
<p>And Adam thus speaking to his sons, groaned out loud, and said: What shall I do? I
am in great grief. And Eve also wept, saying: My lord Adam, arise, give me the half of thy
disease, and let me bear it, because through me this has happened to thee; through me thou
art in distresses and troubles. And Adam said to Eve: Arise, and go with our son Seth near
paradise, and put earth upon your heads, and weep, beseeching the Lord that He may have
compassion upon me, and send His angel to paradise, and give me of the tree in which flows
the oil out of it, and that thou mayest bring it to me; and I shall anoint myself, and have rest,
and show thee the manner in which we were deceived at first.</p>
<p>And Seth and Eve went into the regions of paradise. And as they were going along, Eve
saw her son, and a wild beast fighting with him. And Eye wept, saying: Woe’s me, woe’s
me; for if I come to the day of the resurrection, all who have sinned will curse me, saying,
Eve did not keep the commandment of God. And Eve cried out to the wild beast, saying:
O thou evil wild beast, wilt thou not be afraid to fight with the image of God? How has thy
mouth been opened? how have thy teeth been strengthened? how hast thou not been
mindful of thy subjection, that thou wast formerly subject to the image of God? Then the
wild beast cried out, saying: O Eve, not against us thy upbraiding nor thy weeping, but
against thyself, since the beginning of the wild beasts was from thee. How was thy mouth
opened to eat of the tree about which God had commanded thee not to eat of it? For this

<pb n="1662"/>
reason also our nature has been changed. Now, therefore, thou shalt not be able to bear up,
if I begin to reproach thee. And Seth says to the wild beast: Shut thy mouth and be silent,
and stand off from the image of God till the day of judgment. Then the wild beast says to
Seth: Behold, I stand off, Seth, from the image of God. Then the wild beast fled, and left
him wounded, and went to his covert.</p>
<p>And Seth went with his mother Eve near paradise: and they wept there, beseeching God
to send His angel, to give2460 them the oil of compassion. And God sent to them the
archangel Michael, and he said to them these words: Seth, man of God, do not weary thyself
praying in this supplication about the tree in which flows the oil to anoint thy father Adam;
for it will not happen to thee now, but at the last times. Then shall arise all flesh from Adam
even to that great day, as many as shall be a holy people; then shall be given to them all the
delight of paradise, and God shall be in the midst of them; and there shall not any more be
sinners before Him, because the wicked heart shall be taken from them, and there shall be
given to them a heart made to understand what is good, and to worship God only. Do thou
again go to thy father, since the measure of his life has been fulfilled, equal to2461 three days.
And when his soul goes out, thou wilt behold its dreadful passage.</p>
<p>And the angel, having said this, went away from them. And Seth and Eve came to the
tent where Adam was lying. And Adam says to Eve: Why didst thou work mischief against
us, and bring upon us great wrath, which is death, holding sway over all our race? And he
says to her: Call all our children, and our children’s children, and relate to them the manner
of our transgression.</p>
<p>Then Eve says to them: Listen, all my children, and my children’s children, and I shall
relate to you how our enemy deceived us. It came to pass, while we were keeping paradise,
that we kept each the portion allotted to him by God. And I was keeping in my lot the south
and west. And the devil went into the lot of Adam where were the male wild beasts; since
God parted to us the wild beasts, and had given all the males to your father, and all the females
He gave to me, and each of us watched his own. And the devil spoke to the serpent, saying,
Arise, come to me, and I shall tell you a thing in which thou mayst be of service. Then the
serpent came to him, and the devil says to him, I hear that thou art more sagacious than all
the wild beasts, and I have come to make thy acquaintance;2462 and I have found thee
greater than all the wild beasts, and they associate with thee; notwithstanding, thou doest

not of the fruit of paradise? Arise and come hither, and we shall make him be cast out of

my instrument, and I will speak through thy mouth a word by which thou shalt be able to
deceive him. Then straightway he hung by the walls of paradise about the hour when the
angels of God went up to worship. Then Satan came in the form of an angel, and praised
God as did the angels; and looking out from the wall, I saw him like an angel. And says he
to me, Art thou Eve? And I said to him, I am. And says he to me, What doest thou in
paradise? And I said to him, God has set us to keep it, and to eat of it. The devil answered
me through the mouth of the serpent, Ye do well, but you do not eat of every plant. And I
say to him, Yes, of every plant we eat, but one only which is in the midst of paradise, about
which God has commanded us not to eat of it, since you will die the death. Then says the
serpent to me, As God liveth, I am grieved for you, because you are like cattle. For I do not
wish you to be ignorant of this; but rise, come hither, listen to me, and eat, and perceive the
value of the tree, as He told us. But I said to him, I am afraid lest God be angry with me.
And he says to me, Be not afraid; for as soon as thou eatest, thine eyes shall be opened, and
ye shall be as gods in knowing what is good and what is evil. And God, knowing this, that
ye shall be like Him, has had a grudge against you, and said, Ye shall not eat of it. But do
thou observe the plant, and thou shalt see great glory about it. And I observed the plant,
and saw great glory about it. And I said to him, It is beautiful to the eyes to perceive; and I
was afraid to take of the fruit. And he says to me, Come, I will give to thee: follow me. And
I opened to him, and he came inside into paradise, and went through it before me. And
having walked a little, he turned, and says to me, I have changed my mind, and will not give
thee to eat. And this he said, wishing at last to entice and destroy me. And he says to me,
Swear to me that thou wilt give also to thy husband. And I said to him, I know not by what
oath I shall swear to thee; but what I know I say to thee, By the throne of the Lord, and the
cherubim, and the tree of life, I will give also to my husband to eat. And when he had taken
the oath from me, then he went and ascended upon it. And he put upon the fruit which he
gave me to eat the poison of his wickedness, that is, of his desire; for desire is the head2464
of all sin. And I bent down the branch to the ground, and took of the fruit, and ate. And
in that very hour mine eyes were opened. and I knew that I was stripped2465 of the righteousness
with which I had been clothed; and I wept, saying, What is this thou hast done to

me, because I have been deprived of the glory with which I was clothed? And I wept too
about the oath. And he came down out of the tree, and went out of sight. And I sought
leaves in my portion,2466 that I might cover my shame; and I did not find them from the
plants of paradise, since, at the time that I ate, the leaves of all the plants in my portion fell,
except of the fig alone. And having taken leaves off it, I made myself a girdle, and it is from
those plants of which I ate. And I cried out with a loud voice, saying, Adam, Adam, where
art thou? Arise, come to me, and I shall show thee a great mystery. And when your father
came, I said to him words of wickedness, which brought us down from great glory. For as
soon as he came I opened my mouth, and the devil spoke; and I began to advise him, saying,
Come hither, my lord Adam, listen to me, and eat of the fruit of the tree of which God said
to us not to eat of it, and thou shalt be as God. And your father answered and said, I am
afraid lest God be angry with me. And I said to him, Be not afraid, for as soon as thou shalt
eat thou shalt know good and evil. And then I quickly persuaded him, and he ate; and his
eyes were opened, and he was aware, he also, of his nakedness. And he says to me, O wicked
woman, why hast thou wrought mischief in us? Thou hast alienated me from the glory of
God. And that same hour we heard the archangel Michael sounding his trumpet, calling
the angels, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Come with me to paradise, and hear the word in
which I judge Adam. And when we heard the archangel sounding, we said, Behold, God is
coming into paradise to judge us. And we were afraid, and hid ourselves. And God came
up into paradise, riding upon a chariot of cherubim, and the angels praising Him. When
God came into paradise, the plants both of Adam’s lot and of my lot bloomed, and all lifted
themselves up; and the throne of God was made ready where the tree of life was. And God
called Adam, saying, Adam, where art thou hidden, thinking that I shall not find thee? Shall
the house be hidden from him that built it? Then your father answered and said, Not, Lord,
did we hide ourselves as thinking that we should not be found by Thee; but I am afraid, because
I am naked, and stand in awe of Thy power, O Lord. God says to him, Who hath
shown thee that thou art naked, unless it be that thou hast forsaken my commandment
which I gave thee to keep it? Then Adam remembered the word which I spake to him when
I wished to deceive him, I will put thee out of danger from God. And he turned and said
to me, Why hast thou done this? And I also remembered the word of the serpent, and said,
The serpent deceived me. God says to Adam, Since thou hast disobeyed my commandment,
and obeyed thy wife, cursed is the ground in thy labours. For whenever thou labourest it,
and it will not give its strength, thorns and thistles shall it raise for thee; and in the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat thy bread. And thou shalt be in distresses of many kinds. Thou shalt
weary thyself, and rest not; thou shalt be afflicted by bitterness, and shall not taste of
sweetness; thou shalt be afflicted by heat, and oppressed by cold; and thou shalt toil much,
<note type="footnote">2466 i.e., of the garden.</note>

<pb n="1665"/>
and not grow rich; and thou shalt make haste,2467 and not attain thine end; and the wild
beasts, of which thou wast lord, shall rise up against thee in rebellion, because thou hast not
kept my commandment. And having turned to me, the Lord says to me, Since thou hast
obeyed the serpent, and disobeyed my commandment, thou shalt be in distresses2468 and
unbearable pains; thou shalt bring forth children with great tremblings; and in one hour
shalt thou come to bring them forth,2469 and lose thy life in consequence of thy great straits
and pangs. And thou shalt confess, and say, Lord, Lord, save me; and I shall not return to
the sin of the flesh. And on this account in thine own words I shall judge thee, on account
of the enmity which the enemy hath put in thee; and thou shalt turn again to thy husband,
and he shall be thy lord.2470 And after speaking thus to me, He spoke to the serpent in great
wrath, saying to him, Since thou hast done this, and hast become an ungracious instrument
until thou shouldst deceive those that were remiss in heart, cursed art thou of all the beasts.
Thou shalt be deprived of the food which thou eatest; and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
thy life; upon thy breast and belly shalt thou go, and thou shalt be deprived both of thy
hands and feet; there shall not be granted thee ear, nor wing, nor one limb of all which those
have whom thou hast enticed by thy wickedness, and hast caused them to be cast out of
paradise. And I shall put enmity between thee and between his seed. He shall lie in wait
for2471 thy head, and thou for his heel, until the day of judgment. And having thus said,
He commands His angels that we be cast out of paradise. And as we were being driven
along, and were lamenting, your father Adam entreated the angels, saying, Allow me a little,
that I may entreat God, and that He may have compassion upon me, and pity me, for I only
have sinned. And they stopped driving him. And Adam cried out with weeping, saying,
Pardon me, Lord, what I have done. Then says the Lord to His angels, Why have you stopped
driving Adam out of paradise? It is not that the sin is mine, or that I have judged ill? Then
the angels, falling to the ground, worshipped the Lord, saying, Just art Thou, Lord, and
judgest what is right. And turning to Adam, the Lord said, I will not permit thee henceforth
to be in paradise. And Adam answered and said, Lord, give me of the tree of life, that I may
eat before I am cast out. Then the Lord said to Adam, Thou shalt not now take of it, for it

of thee, that thou mayst not taste of it and be free from death for ever, but that thou
mayst have the war which the enemy has set in thee. But when thou art gone out of paradise,
if thou shalt keep thyself from all evil, as being destined to die, I will again raise thee up
when the resurrection comes, and then there shall be given thee of the tree of life, and thou
shalt be free from death for ever. And having thus said, the Lord commanded us to be cast
out of paradise. And your father wept before the angels over against paradise. And the
angels say to him, What dost thou wish that we should do for thee, Adam? And your father
answered and said to the angels, Behold, you cast me out. I beseech you, allow me to take
sweet odours out of paradise, in order that, after I go out, I may offer sacrifice to God, that
God may listen to me. And the angels, advancing, said to God, Jael, eternal King, order to
be given to Adam sacrifices2472 of sweet odour out of paradise. And God ordered Adam
to go, that he might take perfumes of sweet odour out of paradise for his food. And the
angels let him go, and he gathered both kinds—saffron and spikenard, and calamus2473 and
cinnamon, and other seeds for his food; and having taken them, he went forth out of paradise.
And we came to the earth.2474</p>
<p>Now, then, my children, I have shown you the manner in which we were deceived. But
do ye watch over yourselves, so as not to forsake what is good.</p>
<p>And when she had thus spoken in the midst of her sons, and Adam was lying in his
disease, and he had one other day before going out of the body, Eve says to Adam: Why is
it that thou diest, and I live? or how long time have I to spend after thou diest? tell me. Then
says Adam to Eve: Do not trouble thyself about matters; for thou wilt not be long after me,
but we shall both die alike, and thou wilt be laid into my place.2475 And when I am dead
you will leave2476 me, and let no one touch me, until the angel of the Lord shall say something
about me; for God will not forget me, but will seek His own vessel which He fashioned.
Arise, rather, pray to God until I restore my spirit into the hands of Him who has given it;
because we know not how we shall meet Him who made us, whether He shall be angry with
us, or turn and have mercy upon us. Then arose Eve, and went outside; and falling to the
ground, she said: I have sinned, O God; I have sinned, O Father of all; I have sinned to Thee,
I have sinned against Thy chosen angels, I have sinned against the cherubim, I have sinned
against Thine unshaken throne; I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned much, I have sinned
before Thee, and every sin2477 through me has come upon the creation. And while Eve was

still praying, being on her knees, behold, there came to her the angel of humanity, and raised
her up, saying: Arise, Eve, from thy repentance; for, behold, Adam thy husband has gone
forth from his body; arise and see his spirit carried up to Him that made2478 it, to meet Him.</p>
<p>And Eve arose, and covered her face with her hand; and the angel says to her: Raise
thyself from the things of earth. And Eve gazed up into heaven, and she saw a chariot of
light going along under four shining eagles—and it was not possible for any one born of
woman2479 to tell the glory of them, or to see the face of them—and angels going before the
chariot. And when they came to the place where your father Adam was lying, the chariot
stood still, and the seraphim between your father and the chariot. And I saw golden censers,
and three vials; and, behold, all the angels with incense, and the censers, and the vials, came
to the altar, and blew them up, and the smoke of the incense covered the firmaments. And
the angels fell down and worshipped God, crying out and saying: Holy Jael, forgive; for he
is Thine image, and the work of Thine holy hands.</p>
<p>And again, I Eve saw two great and awful mysteries standing before God. And I wept
for fear, and cried out to my son Seth, saying: Arise, Seth, from the body of thy father Adam,
and come to me, that thou mayst see what the eye of no one hath ever seen; and they are
praying for thy father Adam.2480</p>
<p>Then Seth arose and went to his mother, and said to her: What has befallen thee? and
why weepest thou? She says to him: Look up with thine eyes, and see the seven firmaments
opened, and see with thine eyes how the body of thy father lies upon its face, and all the
holy angels with him, praying for him, and saying: Pardon him, O Father of the universe;
for he is Thine image. What then, my child Seth, will this be? and when will he be delivered
into the hands of our invisible Father and God? And who are the two dark-faced ones who
stand by at the prayer of thy father? And Seth says to his mother: These are the sun and
the moon, and they are falling down and praying for my father Adam. Eve says to him:
And where is their light, and why have they become black-looking? And Seth says to her:
They cannot shine in the presence of the Light of the universe,2481 and for this reason the
light from them has been hidden.</p>
<p>And while Seth was speaking to his mother, the angels lying upon their faces sounded
their trumpets, and cried out with an awful voice, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord
upon what He has made, for He has had compassion upon Adam, the work of His hands.
When the angels had sounded this forth, there came one of the six-winged seraphim, and

hurried Adam to the Acherusian lake, and washed him in presence of God. And he spent
three hours2482 lying, and thus the Lord of the universe, sitting upon His holy throne,
stretched forth His hands, and raised Adam, and delivered him to the archangel Michael,
saying to him: Raise him into paradise, even to the third heaven, and let him be there until
that great and dreadful day which I am to bring upon the world. And the archangel Michael,
having taken Adam, led him away, and anointed him, as God said to him at the pardoning
of Adam.</p>
<p>After all these things, therefore, the archangel asked about the funeral rites of the remains;
and God commanded that all the angels should come together into His presence, each according
to his rank. And all the angels were assembled, some with censers, some with
trumpets. And the Lord of Hosts went up,2483 and the winds drew Him, and cherubim
riding upon the winds, and the angels of heaven went before Him; and they came to where
the body of Adam was, and took it. And they came to paradise, and all the trees of paradise
were moved so that all begotten from Adam hung their heads in sleep at the sweet smell,
except Seth, because he had been begotten according to the appointment of God.</p>
<p>The body of Adam, then, was lying on the ground in paradise, and Seth was grieved
exceedingly about him. And the Lord God says: Adam, why hast thou done this? If thou
hadst kept my commandment, those that brought thee down to this place would not have
rejoiced. Nevertheless I say unto thee, that I will turn their joy into grief, but I will turn thy
grief into joy; and having turned, I will set thee in thy kingdom, on the throne of him that
deceived thee; and he shall be cast into this place, that thou mayst sit upon him. Then shall
be condemned, he and those who hear him; and they shall be much grieved, and shall weep,
seeing thee sitting upon his glorious throne.</p>
<p>And then He said to the archangel Michael: Go into paradise, into the third heaven,
and bring me three cloths of fine linen and silk. And God said to Michael, Gabriel, Uriel,
and Raphael:2484 Cover Adam’s body with the cloths, and bring olive oil of sweet odour,
and pour upon him. And having thus done, they prepared his body for burial. And the
Lord said: Let also the body of Abel be brought. And having brought other cloths, they
prepared it also for burial, since it had not been prepared for burial since the day on which
his brother Cain slew him. For the wicked Cain, having taken great pains to hide it, had
not been able; for the earth did not receive it, saying: I will not receive a body into companionship2485
until that dust which was taken up and fashioned upon me come to me. And

then the angels took it up, and laid it on the rock until his father died. And both were buried,
according to the commandment of God, in the regions of paradise, in the place in which
God found the dust.2486 And God sent seven angels into paradise, and they brought many
sweet-smelling herbs, and laid them in the earth; and thus they took the two bodies, and
buried them in the place which they had dug and built.</p>
<p>And God called Adam, and said: Adam, Adam. And the body answered out of the
ground, and said: Here am I, Lord. And the Lord says to him: I said to thee, Dust2487 thou
art, and unto dust thou shalt return. Again I promise thee the resurrection. I will raise thee
up in the last day in the resurrection, with every man who is of thy seed.</p>
<p>And after these words God made a three-cornered seal, and sealed the tomb, that no
one should do anything to him in the six days, until his rib should return to him. And the
beneficent God and the holy angels having laid him in his place, after the six days Eve also
died. And while she lived she wept about her falling asleep, because she knew not where
her body was to be laid. For when the Lord was present in paradise when they buried Adam,
both she and her children fell asleep, except Seth, as I said. And Eve, in the hour of her
death, besought that she might be buried where Adam her husband was, saying thus: My
Lord, Lord and God of all virtue, do not separate me, Thy servant, from the body of Adam,
for of his members Thou madest me; but grant to me, even me, the unworthy and the sinner,
to be buried by his body. And as I was along with him in paradise, and not separated from
him after the transgression, so also let no one separate us. After having prayed, therefore,
she looked up into heaven, and stood up, and said, beating her breast: God of all, receive
my spirit. And straightway she gave up her spirit to God.</p>
<p>And when she was dead, the archangel Michael stood beside her; and there came three
angels, and took her body, and buried it where the body of Abel was. And the archangel
Michael said to Seth: Thus bury every man that dies, until the day of the resurrection. And
after having given this law, he said to him: Do not mourn beyond six days. And on the
seventh day, rest, and rejoice in it, because in it God and we the angels rejoice in the righteous
soul that has departed from earth. Having thus spoken, the archangel Michael went up into
heaven, glorifying, and saying the Alleluia:2488 Holy, holy, holy Lord, to the glory of God
the Father, because to Him is due glory, honour, and adoration, with His unbeginning and
life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<head>Revelation of Esdras.</head>
<p>Word and Revelation of Esdras, the Holy Prophet and Beloved of God.</p>
<p>It came to pass in the thirtieth year, on the twenty-second of the month, I was in my
house. And I cried out and said to the Most High: Lord, give the glory,2489 in order that I
may see Thy mysteries. And when it was night, there came an angel, Michael the archangel,
and says to me: O Prophet Esdras, refrain from bread for seventy weeks.2490 And I fasted
as he told me. And there came Raphael the commander of the host, and gave me a storax
rod. And I fasted twice sixty2491 weeks. And I saw the mysteries of God and His angels.
And I said to them: I wish to plead before God about the race of the Christians. It is good
for a man not to be born rather than to come into the world. I was therefore taken up into
heaven, and I saw in the first heaven a great army of angels; and they took me to the judgments.
And I heard a voice saying to me: Have mercy on us, O thou chosen of God, Esdras.
Then began I to say: Woe to sinners when they see one who is just more than the angels,
and they themselves are in the Gehenna of fire! And Esdras said: Have mercy on the works
of Thine hands, Thou who art compassionate, and of great mercy. Judge me rather than
the souls of the sinners; for it is better that one soul should be punished, and that the whole
world should not come to destruction. And God said: I will give rest in paradise to the
righteous, and I have become2492 merciful. And Esdras said: Lord, why dost Thou confer
benefits on the righteous? for just as one who has been hired out, and has served out his
time, goes and again works as a slave when he come to his masters, so also the righteous has
received his reward in the heavens. But have mercy on the sinners, for we know that Thou
art merciful. And God said: I do not see how I can have mercy upon them. And Esdras
said: They cannot endure Thy wrath. And God said: This is the fate of such. And God
said: I wish to have thee like Paul and John, as thou hast given me uncorrupted the treasure
that cannot be stolen, the treasure of virginity, the bulwark2493 of men. And Esdras said:
It is good for a man not to be born. It is good not to be in life. The irrational creatures are
better than man, because they have no punishment; but Thou hast taken us, and given us
up to judgment. Woe to the sinners in the world to come! because their judgment is endless,
and the flame unquenchable. And while I was thus speaking to him, there came Michael

and Gabriel, and all the apostles; and they said: Rejoice, O faithful man of God! And Esdras
said:2494 Arise, and come hither with me, O Lord, to judgment. And the Lord said: Behold,
I give thee my covenant between me and thee, that you may receive it. And Esdras said:
Let us plead in Thy hearing.2495 And God said: Ask Abraham your father how a son pleads
with his father,2496 and come plead with us. And Esdras said: As the Lord liveth, I will not
cease pleading with Thee in behalf of the race of the Christians. Where are Thine ancient
compassions, O Lord? Where is Thy long-suffering? And God said: As I have made night
and day, I have made the righteous and the sinner; and he should have lived like the righteous.
And the prophet said: Who made Adam the first-formed? And God said: My undefiled
hands. And I put him in paradise to guard the food of the tree of life; and thereafter
he became disobedient, and did this in transgression. And the prophet said: Was he not
protected by an angel? and was not his life guarded by the cherubim to endless ages? and
how was he deceived who was guarded by angels? for Thou didst command all to be present,
and to attend to what was said by Thee.2497 But if Thou hadst not given him Eve, the serpent
would not have deceived her;2498 but whom Thou wilt Thou savest, and whom Thou wilt
Thou destroyest.2499 And the prophet said: Let us come, my Lord, to a second judgment.
And God said: I cast fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. And the prophet said: Lord, Thou
dealest with us according to our deserts. And God said: Your sins transcend my clemency.
And the prophet said: Call to mind the Scriptures, my Father, who hast measured out Jerusalem,
and set her up again. Have mercy, O Lord, upon sinners; have mercy upon Thine
own creatures;2500 have pity upon Thy works. Then God remembered those whom He had
made, and said to the prophet: How can I have mercy upon them? Vinegar and gall did
they give me to drink,2501 and not even then did they repent. And the prophet said: Reveal
Thy cherubim, and let us go together to judgment; and show me the day of judgment, what
like it is. And God said: Thou hast been deceived, Esdras; for such is the day of judgment
as that in which there is no rain upon the earth; for it is a merciful tribunal as compared
with that day. And the prophet said: I will not cease to plead with Thee, unless I see the
day of the consummation. And God said:2502 Number the stars and the sand of the sea;

and if thou shalt be able to number this, thou art also able to plead with me. And the
prophet said: Lord, Thou knowest that I wear human flesh; and how can I count the stars
of the heaven, and the sand of the sea? And God said: My chosen prophet, no man will
know that great day and the appearing2503 that comes to judge the world. For thy sake, my
prophet, I have told thee the day; but the hour have I not told thee. And the prophet said:
Lord, tell me also the years. And God said: If I see the righteousness of the world, that it
has abounded, I will have patience with them; but if not, I will stretch forth my hand, and
lay hold of the world by the four quarters, and bring them all together into the valley of Jehoshaphat,
2504 and I will wipe out the race of men, so that the world shall be no more. And
the prophet said: And how can Thy right hand be glorified? And God said: I shall be
glorified by my angels. And the prophet said: Lord, if Thou hast resolved to do this, why
didst Thou make man? Thou didst say to our father Abraham,2505 Multiplying I will multiply
thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea-shore;2506 and where
is Thy promise? And God said: First will I make an earthquake for the fall of four-footed
beasts and of men; and when you see that brother gives up brother to death, and that children
shall rise up against their parents, and that a woman forsakes her own husband, and when
nation shall rise up against nation in war, then will you know that the end is near.2507</p>
<p>For then neither brother pities brother, nor man wife, nor children parents, nor friends
friends, nor a slave his master; for he who is the adversary of men shall come up from Tartarus,
and shall show men many things. What shall I make of thee, Esdras? and wilt thou
yet plead with me? And the prophet said: Lord, I shall not cease to plead with Thee. And
God said: Number the flowers of the earth. If thou shalt be able to number them, thou art
able also to plead with me. And the prophet said: Lord, I cannot number them. I wear
human flesh; but I shall not cease to plead with Thee. I wish, Lord, to see also the under
parts of Tartarus. And God said: Come down and see. And He gave me Michael, and
Gabriel, and other thirty-four angels; and I went down eighty-five steps, and they brought
me down five hundred steps, and I saw a fiery throne, and an old man sitting upon it; and
his judgment was merciless. And I said to the angels: Who is this? and what is his sin? And
they said to me: This is Herod, who for a time was a king, and ordered to put to death the
children from two years old and under.2508 And I said: Woe to his soul! And again they
took me down thirty steps, and I there saw boilings up of fire, and in them there was a

multitude of sinners; and I heard their voice, but saw not their forms. And they took me
down lower many steps, which I could not measure. And I there saw old men, and fiery
pivots turning in their ears. And I said: Who are these? and what is their sin? And they
said to me: These are they who would not listen.2509 And they took me down again other
five hundred steps, and I there saw the worm that sleeps not, and fire burning up the sinners.
And they took me down to the lowest part of destruction, and I saw there the twelve plagues
of the abyss. And they took me away to the south, and I saw there a man hanging by the
eyelids; and the angels kept scourging him. And I asked: Who is this? and what is his sin?
And Michael the commander said to me: This is one who lay with his mother; for having
put into practice a small wish, he has been ordered to be hanged. And they took me away
to the north, and I saw there a man bound with iron chains. And I asked: Who is this?
And he said to me: This is he who said, I am the Son of God, that made stones bread, and
water wine. And the prophet said: My lord, let me know what is his form, and I shall tell
the race of men, that they may not believe in him. And he said to me: The form of his
countenance is like that of a wild beast; his right eye like the star that rises in the morning,
and the other without motion; his mouth one cubit; his teeth span long; his fingers like
scythes; the track of his feet of two spans; and in his face an inscription, Antichrist. He has
been exalted to heaven; he shall go down to Hades.2510 At one time he shall become a child;
at another, an old man. And the prophet said: Lord, and how dost Thou permit him, and
he deceives the race of men? And God said: Listen, my prophet. He becomes both child
and old man, and no one believes him that he is my beloved Son. And after this a trumpet,
and the tombs shall be opened, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.2511 Then the
adversary, hearing the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden in outer darkness. Then the
heaven, and the earth, and the sea shall be destroyed. Then shall I burn the heaven eighty
cubits, and the earth eight hundred cubits. And the prophet said: And how has the heaven
sinned? And God said: Since2512<gap reason="omitted"/>there is evil. And the prophet said: Lord, and the earth,
how has it sinned? And God said: Since the adversary, having heard the dreadful threatening,
shall be hidden, even on account of this will I melt the earth, and with it the opponent of
the race of men. And the prophet said: Have mercy, Lord, upon the race of the Christians.
And I saw a woman hanging, and four wild beasts sucking her breasts. And the angels said
to me: She grudged to give her milk, but even threw her infants into the rivers. And I saw
a dreadful darkness, and a night that had no stars nor moon; nor is there there young or
old, nor brother with brother, nor mother with child, nor wife with husband. And I wept,

and said: O Lord God, have mercy upon the sinners. And as I said this, there came a cloud
and snatched me up, and carried me away again into the heavens. And I saw there many
judgments; and I wept bitterly, and said: It is good for a man not to have come out of his
mother’s womb. And those who were in torment cried out, saying: Since thou hast come
hither, O holy one of God, we have found a little remission. And the prophet said: Blessed
are they that weep for their sins. And God said: Hear, O beloved Esdras. As a husbandman
casts the seed of the corn into the ground, so also the man casts his seed into the parts of
the woman. The first month it is all together; the second it increases in size; the third it gets
hair; the fourth it gets nails; the fifth it is turned into milk;2513 and the sixth it is made ready,
and receives life;2514 the seventh it is completely furnished; the ninth the barriers of the gate
of the woman are opened; and it is born safe and sound into the earth. And the prophet
said: Lord, it is good for man not to have been born. Woe to the human race then, when
Thou shalt come to judgment! And I said to the Lord: Lord, why hast Thou created man,
and delivered him up to judgment? And God said, with a lofty proclamation: I will not by
any means have mercy on those who transgress my covenant. And the prophet said: Lord,
where is Thy goodness? And God said: I have prepared all things for man’s sake, and man
does not keep my commandments. And the prophet said: Lord, reveal to me the judgments
and paradise. And the angels took me away towards the east, and I saw the tree of life. And
I saw there Enoch, and Elias, and Moses, and Peter, and Paul, and Luke, and Matthias, and
all the righteous, and the patriarchs. And I saw there the keeping of the air within bounds,
and the blowing of the winds, and the storehouses of the ice, and the eternal judgments.
And I saw there a man hanging by the skull. And they said to me: This man removed
landmarks. And I saw there great judgments.2515 And I said to the Lord: O Lord God, and
what man, then, who has been born has not sinned? And they took me lower down into
Tartarus, and I saw all the sinners lamenting and weeping and mourning bitterly. And I
also wept, seeing the race of men thus tormented. Then God says to me: Knowest thou,
Esdras, the names of the angels at the end of the world? Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael,
Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon.</p>
<p>Then there came a voice to me: Come hither and die, Esdras, my beloved; give that
which hath been entrusted to thee.2516 And the prophet said: And whence can you bring
forth my soul? And the angels said: We can put it forth through the mouth. And the
prophet said: Mouth to mouth have I spoken with God,2517 and it comes not forth thence.

And the angels said: Let us bring it out through thy nostrils. And the prophet said: My
nostrils have smelled the sweet savour of the glory of God. And the angels said: We can
bring it out through thine eyes. And the prophet said: Mine eyes have seen the back parts
of God.2518 And the angels said: We can bring it out through the crown of thy head. And
the prophet said: I walked about with Moses also on the mountain, and it comes not forth
thence. And the angels said: We can put it forth through the points of thy nails. And the
prophet said: My feet also have walked about on the altar. And the angels went away without
having done anything, saying: Lord, we cannot get his soul. Then He says to His only begotten
Son: Go down, my beloved Son, with a great host of angels, and take the soul of my
beloved Esdras. For the Lord, having taken a great host of angels, says to the prophet: Give
me the trust which I entrusted to thee; the crown has been prepared for thee.2519 And the
prophet said: Lord, if Thou take my soul from me, who will be left to plead with Thee for
the race of men? And God said: As thou art mortal, and of the earth, do not plead with
me. And the prophet said: I will not cease to plead. And God said: Give up just now the
trust; the crown has been prepared for thee. Come and die, that thou mayst obtain it. Then
the prophet began to say with tears: O Lord, what good have I done pleading with Thee,
and I am going to fall down into the earth? Woe’s me, woe’s me, that I am going to be eaten
up by worms! Weep, all ye saints and ye righteous, for me, who have pleaded much, and
who am delivered up to death. Weep for me, all ye saints and ye righteous, because I have
gone to the pit of Hades. And God said to him: Hear, Esdras, my beloved. I, who am immortal,
endured a cross; I tasted vinegar and gall; I was laid in a tomb, and I raised up my
chosen ones; I called Adam up out of Hades, that I might save2520the race of men. Do not
therefore be afraid of death: for that which is from me—that is to say, the soul—goes to
heaven; and that which is from the earth—that is to say, the body—goes to the earth, from
which it was taken.2521 And the prophet said: Woe’s me! woe’s me! what shall I set about?
what shall I do? I know not. And then the blessed Esdras began to say: O eternal God, the
Maker of the whole creation, who hast measured the heaven with a span, and who holdest
the earth as a handful,2522 who ridest upon the cherubim, who didst take the prophet Elias
to the heavens in a chariot of fire,2523 who givest food to all flesh, whom all things dread
and tremble at from the face of Thy power,—listen to me, who have pleaded much, and give

And there came to him a voice, saying: Esdras, my beloved, all things whatever thou hast
asked will I give to each one. And immediately he gave up his precious soul with much
honour, in the month of October, on the twenty-eighth. And they prepared him for burial
with incense and psalms; and his precious and sacred body dispenses strength of soul and

<head>Revelation of Paul.</head>
<p>Revelation of the holy Apostle Paul: the things which were revealed to him when he
went up even to the third heaven, and was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
words.2525</p>
<p>There dwelt a certain nobleman in the city of Tarsus, in the house of St. Paul the apostle,
in the government of Theodosius the worshipful king, and of the most illustrious Gratianus;
2526 and there was revealed to him an angel of the Lord, saying: Upturn the foundation
of this house, and lift up what thou shalt find. But he thought that he had had a dream.
And the angel having persisted even to a third vision, the nobleman was compelled to upturn
the foundation; and having dug, he found a marble2527 box containing this revelation; and
having taken it, he showed it to the ruler of the city. And the ruler, seeing it sealed up with
lead, sent it to the King Theodosius, thinking that it was something else.2528 And the king
having received it, and transcribed it, sent the original writing to Jerusalem. And there was
written in it thus:—</p>
<p>The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Say to this people, Till when do you sin, and
add to your sin, and provoke to anger the God who made you, saying that you are children
to Abraham,2529 but doing the works of Satan, going on in speaking against God, boasting
only in your addressing of God, but poor on account of the substance of sin? Know, ye sons
of men, that the whole creation has been made subject to God; but the human race alone,
by sinning, provokes God to anger. For often the great light, the sun, has come before God,
saying against men: Lord God Almighty, how long dost Thou endure all the sin of men?
Command me, and I will burn them up. And there came a voice to him: My long-suffering
endures them all, that they may repent; but if not, they shall come to me, and I will judge
them. And often also the moon and the stars have come before God, saying: Lord God
Almighty, Thou hast given us the dominion of the night, and we no longer cover the thefts,
and adulteries, and blood-sheddings of men; command us, and we shall do marvels against
them. And there came a voice: My long-suffering bears with them, that they may turn to
me; but if not, they shall come to me, and I will judge them. And in like manner also the
sea cried out, saying: Lord God Almighty, the sons of men have profaned Thy holy name;

command me, and I shall rise up and cover the earth, and wipe out from it2530 the sons of
men. And there came a voice, saying: My long-suffering bears with them, that they may
repent; but if not, they shall come to me, and I will judge them. You see, ye sons of men,
that the whole creation has been made subject to God, but the human race alone sins before
God. On account of all these things, bless God without ceasing, and yet more when the sun
is setting. For at this hour all the angels come to God to adore Him, and they bring before
Him the works of men, of each what he has done from morning even to evening, whether
good or evil. And one angel goes rejoicing on account of man when he behaves well, and
another goes with a sad countenance. All the angels at the appointed hour meet for the
worship of God, to bring each day’s works of men. But do ye men bless God without ceasing.
Whenever, therefore, at the appointed hour the angels of pious men come, rejoicing and
singing psalms, they meet for the worship of the Lord; and, behold, the Spirit of God says
to them: Whence do ye come rejoicing? And they answered and said: We are here from
the pious men, who in all piety spend their life, fearing the name of God. Command them,
Lord, to abide even to the end in Thy righteousness. And there came to them a voice: I
have both kept and will keep them void of offence in my kingdom. And when it came to
pass that they went away, there came other angels with a cheerful countenance, shining like
the sun. And behold a voice to them: Whence have ye come? And they answered and said:
We have come from those who have held themselves aloof from the world and the things
in the world for Thy holy name’s sake, who in deserts, and mountains, and caves, and the
dens of the earth, in beds on the ground, and in fastings, spend their life.2531 Command us
to be with them. And there came a voice: Go with them in peace, guarding them. Moreover,
when they went away, behold, there came other angels to worship before God, mourning
and weeping. And the Spirit went forth to meet them, and there came a voice to them:
Whence have ye come? And they answered and said: We have come from those who have
been called by Thy name, and are slaves to the matter of sin.2532 Why, then, is it necessary
to minister unto them? And there came a voice to them: Do not cease to minister unto
them; perhaps they will turn; but if not, they shall come to me, and I will judge them. Know,
sons of men, that all that is done by you day by day, the angels write in the heavens. Do you
therefore cease not to bless God.</p>
<p>And I was in the Holy Spirit, and an angel says to me: Come, follow me, that I may
show thee the place of the just, where they go after their end. And I went along with the
angel, and he brought me up into the heavens under the firmament; and I perceived and
saw powers great and dreadful, full of wrath, and through the mouth of them a flame of fire

coming out, and clothed in garments of fire. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And
he said to me: These are they who are sent away to the souls of the sinners in the hour of
necessity; for they have not believed that there is judgment and retribution. And I looked
up into the heaven, and saw angels, whose faces shone like the sun, girded with golden
girdles, having in their hands prizes, on which the name of the Lord was inscribed, full of
all meekness and compassion. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he answered
and said to me: These are they who are sent forth in the day of the resurrection to bring the
souls of the righteous,2533 who intrepidly walk according to God.2534 And I said to the
angel: I wish to see the souls of the righteous and of the sinners, how they go out of the
world. And the angel said to me: Look to the earth. And I looked, and saw the whole world
as nothing disappearing before me. And I said to the angel: Is this the greatness of men?
And he said to me: Yes; for thus every unjust man disappears. And I looked, and saw a
cloud of fire wrapped over all the world; and I said: What is this, my lord? And he said to
me: This is the unrighteousness mingled with the destruction of the sinners. And I wept,
and said to the angel: I wished to see the departures of the righteous and of the sinners, in
what manner they go out of the world. And the angel says to me: Paul, look down, and see
what thou hast asked. And I looked, and saw one of the sons of men falling near death.
And the angel says to me: This is a righteous man, and, behold, all his works stand beside
him in the hour of his necessity.2535 And there were beside him good angels, and along
with them also evil angels. And the evil angels indeed found no place in him, but the good
took possession of2536 the soul of the righteous man, and said to it: Take note of the body
whence thou art coming out; for it is necessary for thee again to return to it in the day of
the resurrection, that thou mayst receive what God hath promised to the righteous. And
the good angels who had received the soul of the righteous man, saluted it, as being well
known to them. And it went with them; and the Spirit came forth to meet them, saying:
Come, soul, enter into the place of the resurrection, which God hath prepared for His
righteous ones. And the angel said to me: Look down to the earth, and behold the soul of
the impious, how it goes forth from its tabernacle, which has provoked God to anger, saying,
Let us eat and drink;2537 for who is it that has gone down to Hades, and come up and announced
that there is judgment and retribution? And take heed, and see all his works which
he has done standing before him. And the evil angels came and the good. The good therefore
found no place of rest in it, but the evil took possession of it, saying: O wretched soul, pay

heed to thy flesh; take note of that whence thou art coming forth, for thou must return into
thy flesh in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive the recompense of thy sins.
And when it had gone forth from its tabernacle, the angel who had lived along with it ran
up to it, saying to it: O wretched soul, whither goest thou? I am he who each day wrote
down thy sins. Thou hast destroyed the time of repentance; be exceedingly ashamed. And
when it came, all the angels saw it, and cried out with one voice, saying: Woe to thee,
wretched soul! what excuse hast thou come to give to God? And the angel of that soul said:
Weep for it, all of you, along with me. And the angel came up, and worshipped the Lord,
saying: Lord, behold the soul which has dwelt in wickedness in its time, and in its temporary
life; do to it according to Thy decision. And there came a voice to that soul, saying: Where
is the fruit of thy righteousness? And it was silent,2538 not being able to give an answer.
And again there came a voice to it: He who has shown mercy will have mercy shown to
him;2539 he who has not shown mercy will not have mercy shown to him. Let this soul be
delivered to the merciless angel Temeluch, and let it be cast into outer darkness, where there
is weeping and gnashing of teeth. And there was a voice as of tens of thousands, saying:
Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and righteous is Thy judgment.2540 And moreover I saw, and,
behold, another soul was led by an angel; and it wept, saying: Have mercy upon me, O
righteous Judge, and deliver me from the hand of this angel, because he is dreadful and
merciless. And a voice came to it, saying: Thou wast altogether merciless, and for this
reason thou hast been delivered up to such an angel. Confess thy sins which thou hast done
in the world. And that soul said: I have not sinned, O righteous Judge. And the Lord said
to that soul: Verily thou seemest as if thou wert in the world, and wert hiding thy deeds
from men. Knowest thou not that whensoever any one dies, his deeds run before him,
whether they are good or evil? And when it heard this, it was silent. And I heard the Judge
saying: Let the angel come, having in his hands the record of thy sins. And the Judge says
to the angel: I say to thee the angel, Disclose all. Say what he has done five years before his
death. By myself I swear to thee, that in the first period of his life there was forgetfulness
of all his former sins. And the angel answered and said: Lord, command the souls to stand
beside their angels; and that same hour they stood beside them. And the lord of that soul
said: Take note of these souls, and whether thou hast in any way sinned against them. And
it answered and said: Lord, a year has not been completed since I killed the one and lived
with the other. And not only this, but I also wronged it. And the Lord said to it: Knowest
thou not that he who wrongs any one in the world is kept, as soon as he dies, in the place
until he whom he has wronged come, and both shall be judged before me, and each receive

according to his works? And I heard a voice saying: Let this soul be delivered to the angel
Tartaruch, and guarded till the great day of judgment. And I heard a voice as of tens of
thousands saying: Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and righteous Thy judgment.</p>
<p>And the angel says to me: Hast thou seen all these things? And I answered: Yes my
lord. And again he said to me: Come, follow me, and I shall show thee the place of the
righteous. And I followed him, and he set me before the doors of the city. And I saw a
golden gate, and two golden pillars before it, and two golden plates upon it full of inscriptions.
And the angel said to me: Blessed is he who shall enter into these doors; because not
every one goeth in, but only those who have single-mindedness, and guiltlessness, and a
pure heart.2541 And I asked the angel: For what purpose have the inscriptions been graven
on these plates? And he said to me: These are the names of the righteous, and of those who
serve God. And I said to him: Is it so that their names have been inscribed in heaven itself
while they are yet alive? And the angel said to me:<gap reason="omitted"/>2542 of the angels, such as serve Him
well are acknowledged by God. And straightway the gate was opened, and there came forth
a hoary-headed man to meet us; and he said to me: Welcome, Paul, beloved of God! and,
with a joyful countenance, he kissed me with tears. And I said to him: Father, why weepest
thou? And he said to me: Because God hath prepared many good things for men, and they
do not His will in order that they may enjoy them. And I asked the angel: My lord, who is
this? And he said to me: This is Enoch, the witness of the last day.2543 And the angel says
to me: See that whatever I show thee in this place thou do not announce, except what I tell
thee. And he set me upon2544 the river whose source springs up in the circle of heaven; and
it is this river which encircleth the whole earth. And he says to me: This river is Ocean.
And there was then a great light. And I said: My lord, what is this? And he said to me:
This is the land of the meek. Knowest thou not that it is written, Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth?2545 The souls of the righteous, therefore, are kept in this place.
And I said to the angel: When, then, will they be made manifest? And he said to me: When
the Judge shall come in the day of the resurrection, and sit down. Then, accordingly, shall
he command, and shall reveal the earth, and it shall be lighted up; and the saints shall appear

in it, and shall delight themselves in the good2546 that have been reserved from the foundation
of the world. And there were by the bank of the river, trees planted, full of different fruits.
And I looked towards the rising of the sun, and I saw there trees of great size full of fruits;
and that land was more brilliant than silver and gold; and there were vines growing on those
date-palms, and myriads of shoots, and myriads of clusters on each branch. And I said to
the archangel: What is this, my lord? And he says to me: This is the Acherusian lake, and
within it the city of God. All are not permitted to enter into it, except whosoever shall repent
of his sins; and as soon as he shall repent, and alter his life, he is delivered to Michael, and
they cast him into the Acherusian lake, and then he brings him in the city of God, near the
righteous. And I wondered and blessed God at all that I saw. And the angel said to me:
Follow me, that I may bring thee into the city of God, and into its light. And its light was
greater than the light of the world, and greater than gold, and walls encircled it. And the
length and the breadth of it were a hundred stadia. And I saw twelve gates, exceedingly ornamented,
leading into the city; and four rivers encircled it, flowing with milk, and honey,
and oil, and wine. And I said to the angel: My lord, what are these rivers? And he said to
me: These are the righteous who, when in the world, did not make use of these things, but
humbled themselves for the sake of God; and here they receive a recompense ten thousand
fold.</p>
<p>And I, going into the city, saw a very lofty tree before the doors of the city, having no
fruit, and a few men under it; and they wept exceedingly, and the trees bent down to them.
And I, seeing them, wept, and asked the angel: Who are these, that they have not turned to
go into the city? And he said to me: Yes, the root of all evils is vainglory. And I said: And
these trees, why have they thus humbled themselves? And the angel answered and said to
me: For this reason the trees are not fruit-bearing, because they have not withheld themselves
from vaunting. And I asked the angel: My lord, for what reason have they been put aside
before the doors of the city? And he answered and said to me: On account of the great
goodness of God, since by this way Christ is going to come into the city, and that those who
go along with Him may plead for these men, and that they may be brought in along with
them. And I was going along, guided by the angel, and he set me upon the river. And I saw
there all the prophets; and they came and saluted me, saying: Welcome, Paul, beloved of
God. And I said to the angel: My lord, who are these? And he said to me: These are all
the prophets, and these are the songs of all the prophecies,2547 and of whoever hath grieved
his soul, not doing its will, for God’s sake. Having departed, then, he comes here, and the
prophets salute him. And the angel brought me to the south of the city, where the river of
milk is. And I saw there all the infants that King Herod slew for the Lord’s name’s sake.

<pb n="1683"/>
And the angel took me again to the east of the city, and I saw there Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.
And I asked the angel: My lord, what place is this? And he said to me: Every one who is
hospitable to men comes hither when he comes out of the world, and they salute him as a
friend of God on account of his love to strangers. And again he took me away to another
place, and I saw there a river like oil on the north of the city, and I saw people there rejoicing
and singing praises. And I asked: Who are these, my lord? And he said to me: These are
they who have given themselves up to God; for they are brought into this city. And I looked,
and saw in the midst of the city an altar, great and very lofty; and there was one standing
near the altar, whose face shone like the sun, and he had in his hands a psaltery and a harp,
and he sung the Alleluia delightfully, and his voice filled all the city. And all with one consent
accompanied him, so that the city was shaken by their shouting. And I asked the angel:
Who is this that singeth delightfully, whom all accompany? And he said to me: This is the
prophet David; this is the heavenly Jerusalem. When, therefore, Christ shall come in His
second appearing, David himself goes forth with all the saints. For as it is in the heavens,
so also upon earth: for it is not permitted without David to offer sacrifice even in the day
of the sacrifice of the precious body and blood of Christ; but it is necessary for David to sing
the Alleluia. And I asked the angel: My lord, what is the meaning of Alleluia? It is called
in Hebrew, thebel, marematha—speech to God who founded all things: let us glorify Him
in the same. So that every one who sings the Alleluia glorifies God.</p>
<p>When these things, therefore, had been thus said to me by the angel, he led me outside
of the city, and the Acherusian lake, and the good land, and set me upon the river of the
ocean that supports the firmament of the heaven, and said to me: Knowest thou where I
am going? And I said: No, my lord. And he said to me: Follow me, that I may show thee
where the souls of the impious and the sinners are. And he took me to the setting of the
sun, and where the beginning of the heaven had been founded upon the river of the ocean.
And I saw beyond the river, and there was no light there, but darkness, and grief, and
groaning; and I saw a bubbling river, and a great multitude both of men and women who
had been cast into it, some up to the knees, others up to the navel, and many even up to the
crown of the head. And I asked: Who are these? And he said to me: These are they who
lived unrepenting in fornications and adulteries. And I saw at the south-west of the river
another river, where there flowed a river of fire, and there was there a multitude of many
souls. And I asked the angel: Who are these, my lord? And he said to me: These are the
thieves, and slanderers, and flatterers, who did not set up God as their help, but hoped in
the vanity of their riches. And I said to him: What is the depth of this river? And he said
to me: Its depth has no measure, but it is immeasurable. And I groaned and wept because
of mankind. And the angel said to me: Why weepest thou? Art thou more merciful than
God? for, being holy, God, repenting over men, waits for their conversion and repentance;
but they, deceived by their own will, come here, and are eternally punished. And I looked

<pb n="1684"/>
into the fiery river, and saw an old man dragged along by two, and they pulled him in up
to the knee. And the angel Temeluch coming, laid hold of an iron with his hand, and with
it drew up the entrails of that old man through his mouth. And I asked the angel: My lord,
who is this that suffers this punishment? And he said to me: This old man whom thou seest
was a presbyter; and when he had eaten and drunk, then he performed the service of God.
And I saw there another old man carried in haste by four angels; and they threw him into
the fiery river up to the girdle, and he was frightfully burnt by the lightnings. And I said to
the angel: Who is this, my lord? And he said to me: This whom thou seest was a bishop,
and that name indeed he was well pleased to have; but in the goodness of God he did not
walk, righteous judgment he did not judge, the widow and the orphan he did not pity, he
was neither affectionate nor hospitable;2548 but now he has been recompensed according
to his works. And I looked, and saw in the middle of the river another man up to the navel,
having his hands all bloody, and worms were coming up through his mouth. And I asked
the angel: Who is this, my lord? And he said to me: This whom thou seest was a deacon,
who ate and drank, and ministered to God. And I looked to another place where there was
a brazen wall in flames, and within it men and women eating up their own tongues, dreadfully
judged. And I asked the angel: Who are these, my lord? And he said to me: These are they
who in the church speak against their neighbours, and do not attend to the word of God.
And I looked, and saw a bloody pit. And I said: What is this pit? And he said to me: This
is the place where are cast the wizards, and sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the
adulterers, and those that oppress widows and orphans. And I saw in another place women
wearing black, and led away into a dark place. And I asked: Who are these, my lord? And
he said to me: These are they who did not listen to their parents, but before their marriage
defiled their virginity. And I saw women wearing white robes, being blind, and standing
upon obelisks of fire; and an angel was mercilessly beating them, saying: Now you know
where you are; you did not attend when the Scriptures were read to you. And the angel said
to me: These are they who corrupted themselves and killed their infants. Their infants
therefore came crying out: Avenge us of our mothers. And they were given to an angel to
be carried away into a spacious place, but their parents into everlasting fire.</p>
<p>And the angel took me up from these torments, and set me above a well, which had
seven seals upon its mouth. And the angel who was with me said to the angel at the well of
that place: Open the well, that Paul the beloved of God may see, because there has been
given to him authority to see the torments. And the angel of the place said to me: Stand
afar off, until I open the seals. And when he had opened them, there came forth a stench
which it was impossible to bear. And having come near the place, I saw that well filled with
darkness and gloom, and great narrowness of space in it. And the angel who was with me
<note type="footnote">2548 Comp. 1 Tim. iii. 1–4.</note>

<pb n="1685"/>
said to me: This place of the well which thou seest is cast off from the glory of God, and
none of the angels is importunate in behalf of them; and as many as have professed that the
holy Mary is not the mother of God, and that the Lord did not become man out of her, and
that the bread of the thanksgiving and the cup of blessing are not His flesh and blood,2549
are cast into this well: and as I said before no angel is importunate in their behalf. And I
saw towards the setting of the sun, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, many men
and women there tormented. And I said to the angel: Who are these, my lord? And he
said to me: These are they who say that there is no resurrection of the dead; and to them
mercy never comes.</p>
<p>Having heard this, I wept bitterly; and looking up into the firmament, I saw the heaven
opened, and the archangel Gabriel coming down with hosts of angels, who were going round
about all the torments. And they who were judged in the torments seeing them, all cried
out with one loud voice: Have mercy upon us, Gabriel, who standest in the presence of
God; for we heard that there was a judgment: behold, we know it. And the archangel
Gabriel answered and said: As the Lord liveth, beside whom I stand, night and day without
ceasing I plead in behalf of the race of men; but they did not do any good when in life, but
spent the period of their life in vanity. And now I shall weep, even I, along with the beloved
Paul; perhaps the good Lord may have compassion, and grant you remission. And they
assented with one voice: Have mercy upon us, O Lord. And they fell down before God,
and supplicated, saying: Have mercy, O Lord, upon the sons of men whom Thou hast made
after Thine image. And the heaven was shaken like a leaf, and I saw the four and twenty
elders lying on their face; and I saw the altar, and the throne, and the veil; and all of them
entreated the glory of God;2550 and I saw the Son of God with glory and great power coming
down to the earth.2551 And when the sound of the trumpet took place, all who were in the
torments cried out, saying: Have mercy upon us Son of God; for to Thee has been given
power over things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth. And there
came a voice saying: What good work have you done, that you are asking for rest? For you
have done as you wished, and have not repented, but you have spent your life in profligacy.
But now for the sake of Gabriel, the angel of my righteousness and for the sake of Paul my

consider Him as all mortal, and who say that the sacrament of the body of our Lord is bread. The word θεοτόκος

by the condemnation of the former by the Council of Ephesus, a.d. 431. The view of the Eucharist in the text is
not inconsistent with an early date, though it must be remembered that the idea of a substantial presence became
the orthodox doctrine only after the Second Council of Nicæa in a.d. 787.</note>

beloved, I give you a night and the day of the holy Lord’s day, on which I rose from the dead,
for rest. And all who were in the torments cried out, saying: We bless Thee, O Son of the
living God; better for us is such rest than the life which we lived when spending our time
in the world.</p>
<p>And after these things the angel says to me: Behold, thou hast seen all the torments:
come, follow me, that I may lead thee away to paradise, and that thou mayst change thy soul
by the sight of the righteous; for many desire to salute thee. And he took me by an impulse
of the Spirit, and brought me into paradise. And he says to me: This is paradise, where
Adam and Eve transgressed. And I saw there a beautiful tree of great size, on which the
Holy Spirit rested; and from the root of it there came forth all manner of most sweet-smelling
water, parting into four channels. And I said to the angel: My lord, what is this tree, that
there comes forth from it a great abundance of this water, and where does it go? And he
answered and said to me: Before the heaven and the earth existed, He divided them into
four kingdoms and heads, of which the names are Phison, Gehon, Tigris, Euphrates. And
having again taken hold of me by the hand, he led me near the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil. And he says to me: This is the tree by means of which death came into the world,
and Adam took of the fruit of it from his wife, and ate; and thereafter they were cast out
hence. And he showed me another, the tree of life, and said to me: This the cherubim and
the flaming sword guard. And when I was closely observing the tree, and wondering, I saw
a woman coming from afar off, and a multitude of angels singing praises to her. And I asked
the angel: Who is this, my lord, who is in so great honour and beauty? And the angel says
to me: This is the holy Mary, the mother of the Lord. And she came and saluted me, saying:
Welcome, Paul, beloved of God, and angels, and men; thou hast proclaimed the word of
God in the world, and established churches, and all bear testimony to thee who have been
saved by means of thee: for, having been delivered from the deception of idols through thy
teaching, they come here.</p>
<p>While they were yet speaking to me, I gazed, and saw other three men coming. And I
asked the angel: Who are these, my lord? And he said to me: These are Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, the righteous forefathers. And they came and saluted me, saying: Welcome,
Paul, beloved of God<gap reason="omitted"/>God did not grieve us. But we know thee in the flesh, before thou
camest forth out of the world. And in succession they told me their names from Abraham
to Manasseh. And one of them, Joseph who was sold in Egypt, says to me: Hear me, Paul,
friend of God: I did not requite my brethren who cursed me. For blessed is he who is able
to endure trial, because the Lord will give him in requital sevenfold reward in the world to
come.2552 And while he was yet speaking with me, I saw another coming afar off, and the
appearance of him was as the appearance of an angel. And I asked the angel, saying: My
<note type="footnote">2552 Comp. Matt. xix. 29.</note>

<pb n="1687"/>
lord, who is this? And he said to me: This is Moses the lawgiver, by whom God led forth
the children of Israel out of the slavery of Egypt. And when he came near me, he saluted
me weeping. And I said to him: Father, why weepest thou, being righteous and meek?2553
And he answered and said to me: I must weep for every man, because I brought trouble
upon a people that does not understand, and they have not borne fruit; and I see the sheep
of which I was shepherd scattered, and the toil which I toiled for the children of Israel has
been counted for nothing; and they saw powers2554 and hosts in the midst of them, and
they did not understand; and I see the Gentiles worshipping, and believing through thy
word, and being converted, and coming here, and out of my people that was so great not
one has understood. For, when the Jews hanged the Son of God upon the cross, all the angels
and archangels, and the righteous, and the whole creation of things in heaven, and things
in earth, and things under the earth, lamented and mourned with a great lamentation, but
the impious and insensate Jews did not understand; wherefore there has been prepared for
them the fire everlasting, and the worm that dies not.</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking, there came other three, and saluted me, saying: Welcome,
Paul, beloved of God, the boast of the churches, and model of angels. And I asked: Who
are you? And the first said: I am Isaiah, whom Manasseh sawed with a wood saw.2555 And
the second said: I am Jeremiah, whom the Jews stoned, but they remained burnt up with
everlasting fire. And the third said: I am Ezekiel, whom the slayers of the Messiah pierced;
all these things have we endured, and we have not been able to turn the stony heart of the
Jews. And I threw myself on my face, entreating the goodness of God, because He had had
mercy upon me, and had delivered me from the race of the Hebrews. And there came a
voice saying: Blessed art thou, Paul, beloved of God; and blessed are those who through
thee have believed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, because for them has been prepared
everlasting life.</p>
<p>While this voice was yet speaking, there came another, crying: Blessed art thou, Paul.
And I asked the angel: Who is this, my lord? And he said to me: This is Noah, who lived
in the time of the deluge. And when we had saluted each other, I asked him: Who art thou?
And he said to me: I am Noah, who in a hundred years built the ark, and without putting
off the coat which I wore, or shaving my head; moreover, I practised continence, and did
not come near my wife; and in the hundred years my coat was not dirtied, and the hair of
my head was not diminished. And I ceased not to proclaim to men, Repent, for, behold, a
deluge is coming. And no one paid heed; but all derided me, not refraining from their
lawless deeds, until the water of the deluge came and destroyed them all.</p>

<p>And looking away, I saw other two from afar off. And I asked the angel: Who are these,
my lord? And he said to me: These are Enoch and Elias. And they came and saluted me,
saying: Welcome, Paul, beloved of God! And I said to them: Who are you? And Elias the
prophet answered and said to me: I am Elias the prophet, who prayed to God, and He caused
that no rain should come down upon the earth for three years and six months, on account
of the unrighteousness of the sons of men. For often, of a truth, even the angel besought
God on account of the rain; and I heard, Be patient until Elias my beloved shall pray, and I
send rain upon the earth.2556</p>

blessing, and a blessing is reserved for him. Then he departed from me. And the angel who was with me led
me forth, and said unto me: Lo, unto thee is given this mystery and revelation. As thou pleasest, make it known
unto the sons of men.—And then follow details of the depositing of the revelation under the foundation of the

<p>After the taking up of our Lord Jesus Christ, I John was alone upon Mount Tabor,2557
where also He showed us His undefiled Godhead; and as I was not able to stand, I fell upon
the ground, and prayed to the Lord, and said: O Lord my God, who hast deemed me worthy
to be Thy servant, hear my voice, and teach me about Thy coming. When Thou shalt come
to the earth, what will happen? The heaven and the earth, and the sun and the moon, what
will happen to them in those times? Reveal to me all; for I am emboldened, because Thou
listenest to Thy servant.</p>
<p>And I spent seven days praying; and after this a cloud of light caught me up from the
mountain, and set me before the face of the heaven. And I heard a voice saying to me: Look
up, John, servant of God, and know. And having looked up, I saw the heaven opened, and
there came forth from within the heaven a smell of perfumes of much sweet odour; and I
saw an exceeding great flood of light, more resplendent than the sun. And again I heard a
voice saying to me: Behold, righteous John. And I directed my sight, and saw a book lying,
of the thickness, methought, of seven mountains;2558 and the length of it the mind of man
cannot comprehend, having seven seals. And I said: O Lord my God, reveal to me what is
written in this book. And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. In this book
which thou seest there have been written the things in the heaven, and the things in the
earth, and the things in the abyss, and the judgments and righteousness of all the human
race.2559 And I said: Lord, when shall these things come to pass? and what do those times
bring? And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John.2560 There shall be in that
time abundance of corn and wine, such as there hath never been upon the earth, nor shall
ever be until those times come. Then the ear of corn shall produce a half choenix,2561 and

me: Hear, righteous John. Then shall appear the denier, and he who is set apart in the
darkness, who is called Antichrist. And again I said: Lord, reveal to me what he is like.
And I heard a voice saying to me: The appearance of his face is dusky;2562 the hairs of his
head are sharp, like darts; his eyebrows like a wild beast’s; his right eye like the star which
rises in the morning, and the other like a lion’s; his mouth about one cubit; his teeth span
long; his fingers like scythes; the print of his feet of two spans; and on his face an inscription,
Antichrist; he shall be exalted even to heaven, and shall be cast down even to Hades, making
false displays.2563 And then will I make the heaven brazen, so that it shall not give moisture2564
upon the earth; and I will hide the clouds in secret places, so that they shall not
bring moisture upon the earth; and I will command the horns of the wind, so that the wind
shall not blow upon the earth.2565</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and how many years will he do this upon the earth? And I
heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. Three years shall those times be; and I
will make the three years like three months, and the three months like three weeks, and the
three weeks like three days, and the three days like three hours, and the three hours like
three seconds, as said the prophet David, His throne hast Thou broken down to the ground;
Thou hast shortened the days of his time; Thou hast poured shame upon him.2566 And

And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. Then will I send forth mine angels,
and they shall take the ram’s horns that lie upon the cloud; and Michael and Gabriel shall
go forth out of the heaven and sound with those horns, as the prophet David foretold, With
the voice of a trumpet of horn.2568 And the voice of the trumpet shall be heard from the
one quarter of the world to the other;2569 and from the voice of that trumpet all the earth
shall be shaken, as the prophet foretold, And at the voice of the bird every plant shall arise;2570
that is, at the voice of the archangel all the human race shall arise.2571</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, those who are dead from Adam even to this day, and who dwell
in Hades from the beginning of the world, and who die at the last ages, what like shall they
arise? And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. All the human race shall
arise thirty years old.</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, they die male and female, and some old, and some young, and
some infants. In the resurrection what like shall they arise? And I heard a voice saying to
me: Hear, righteous John. Just as the bees are, and differ not one from another, but are all
of one appearance and one size, so also shall every man be in the resurrection. There is
neither fair, nor ruddy, nor black, neither Ethiopian nor different countenances; but they
shall all arise of one appearance and one stature. All the human race shall arise without
bodies, as I told you that in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God.2572</p>

<p>And again I said: Lord, is it possible in that world to recognise each other, a brother
his brother, or a friend his friend, or a father his own children, or the children their own
parents? And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, John. To the righteous there is recognition,
but to the sinners not at all; they cannot in the resurrection recognise each other. And again
I John said: Lord, is there there recollection of the things that are here, either fields or
vineyards, or other things here? And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John.
The prophet David speaks, saying, I remembered that we are dust: as for man, his days are
as grass; as a flower of the field, so he shall flourish: for a wind hath passed over it, and it
shall be no more, and it shall not any longer know its place.2573 And again the same said:
His spirit2574 shall go forth, and he returns to his earth; in that day all his thoughts shall

the venerable and holy images, and the glorious and precious crosses, and the sacred vessels
of the churches, and the divine and sacred books; and all the precious and holy things shall
be lifted up by clouds into the air. And then will I order to be lifted up the great and venerable
sceptre,2576 on which I stretched forth my hands, and all the orders of my angels shall do
reverence to it. And then shall be lifted up all the race of men upon clouds, as the Apostle
Paul foretold.2577 Along with them we shall be snatched up in2578 clouds to meet the Lord
in the air. And then shall come forth every evil spirit, both in the earth and in the abyss,

be lifted up upon the clouds.</p>

come forth four great winds, and they shall sweep2580 all the face of the earth from the one
end of the earth to the other; and the Lord shall sweep sin from off the earth, and the earth
shall be made white like snow, and it shall become as a leaf of paper, without cave, or
mountain, or hill, or rock; but the face of the earth from the rising even to the setting of the
sun shall be like a table, and white as snow; and the reins of the earth shall be consumed by
fire, and it shall cry unto me, saying, I am a virgin before thee, O Lord, and there is no sin
in me; as the prophet David said aforetime, Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall
be made pure; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.2581 And again

then shall come forth the great and venerable sceptre, with thousands of angels worshipping
it, as I said before; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man from the heaven with
power and great glory.2584 And then the worker of iniquity with his servants shall behold
it, and gnash his teeth exceedingly, and all the unclean spirits shall be turned to flight. And
then, seized by invisible power, having no means of flight, they shall gnash their teeth against
him, saying to him: Where is thy power? How hast thou led us astray? and we have fled
away, and have fallen away from the glory which we had beside Him who is coming to judge
us, and the whole human race. Woe to us! because He banishes us into outer darkness.</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and after that what wilt Thou do? And I heard a voice saying
to me: Then will I send an angel out of heaven, and he shall cry with a loud voice, saying,
Hear, O earth, and be strong, saith the Lord; for I am coming down to thee. And the voice
of the angel shall be heard from the one end of the world even to the other, and even to the
remotest part of the abyss. And then shall be shaken all the power of the angels and of the

heaven shall be shaken, and there shall be fear and astonishment upon all the angels. And
then the heavens shall be rent from the rising of the sun even to the setting, and an innumerable
multitude of angels shall come down to the earth; and then the treasures of the heavens
shall be opened, and they shall bring down every precious thing, and the perfume of incense,
and they shall bring down to the earth Jerusalem robed like a bride.2585 And then there
shall go before me myriads of angels and archangels, bearing my throne, crying out, Holy,
holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth; heaven and earth are full of Thy glory.2586 And then will I come
forth with power and great glory, and every eye in2587 the clouds shall see me; and then
every knee shall bend, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the
earth.2588 And then the heaven shall remain empty; and I will come down upon the earth,
and all that is in the air shall be brought down upon the earth, and all the human race and
every evil spirit along with Antichrist, and they shall all be set before me naked, and chained
by the neck.</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, what will become of the heavens, and the sun, and the moon,
along with the stars? And I heard a voice saying to me: Behold, righteous John. And I
looked, and saw a Lamb having seven eyes and seven horns.2589 And again I heard a voice
saying to me: I will bid the Lamb come before me, and will say, Who will open this book?
And all the multitudes of the angels will answer, Give this book to the Lamb to open it. And
then will I order the book to be opened. And when He shall open the first seal, the stars of
the heaven shall fall, from the one end of it to the other. And when He shall open the second
seal, the moon shall be hidden, and there shall be no light in her. And when He shall open
the third seal, the light of the sun shall be withheld, and there shall not be light upon the
earth. And when He shall open the fourth seal, the heavens shall be dissolved, and the air
shall be thrown into utter confusion, as saith the prophet: And the heavens are the works
of Thy hands; they shall perish, but Thou endurest, and they shall all wax old as a garment.
2590 And when He shall open the fifth seal, the earth shall be rent, and all the tribunals
upon the face of all the earth shall be revealed. And when He shall open the sixth seal, the
half of the sea shall disappear. And when He shall open the seventh seal, Hades shall be
uncovered.</p>

into outer darkness, where the depths2591 are. And I said: Lord, and in what place does it
lie? And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. As big a stone as a man of
thirty years old can roll, and let go down into the depth, even falling down for twenty years
will not arrive at the bottom of Hades; as the prophet David said before, And He made
darkness His secret place.2592</p>
<p>And I said: Lord, and after them what nation2593 will be questioned? And I heard a
voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. There will be questioned of Adam’s race those
nations, both the Greek and those who have believed in idols, and in the sun, and in the
stars, and those who have defiled the faith by heresy, and who have not believed the holy2594
resurrection, and who have not confessed the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost:
then will I send them away into Hades, as the prophet David foretold, Let the sinners be
turned into Hades, and all the nations that forget God.2595 And again he said: They were
put in Hades like sheep; death shall be their shepherd.2596</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and after them whom wilt Thou judge? And I heard a voice
saying to me: Hear, righteous John. Then the race of the Hebrews shall be examined, who
nailed me to the tree like a malefactor. And I said: And what punishment will these get,
and in what place, seeing that they did such things to Thee? And I heard a voice saying to
me: They shall go away into Tartarus, as the prophet David foretold, They cried out, and
there was none to save; to the Lord, and He did not hearken to them.2597 And again the
Apostle Paul said: As many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and
as many as have sinned in law shall be judged by means of law.2598</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and what of those who have received baptism? And I heard a

righteous and the sinners; for the righteous shall shine as lights and as the sun, but the sinners
shall stand in darkness.</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and do all the Christians go into one punishment?—kings, high
priests, priests, patriarchs, rich and poor, bond and free? And I heard a voice saying to me:
Hear, righteous John. As the prophet David foretold, The expectation of the poor shall not
perish for ever.2604 Now about kings: they shall be driven like slaves, and shall weep like
infants; and about patriarchs, and priests, and Levites, of those that have sinned, they shall
be separated in their punishments, according to the nature2605 of the peculiar transgression
of each,—some in the river of fire, and some to the worm that dieth not, and others in the
seven-mouthed pit of punishment. To these punishments the sinners will be apportioned.</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and where will the righteous dwell? And I heard a voice saying
to me: Then shall paradise be revealed; and the whole world and paradise shall be made
one, and the righteous shall be on the face of all the earth with my angels, as the Holy Spirit
foretold through the prophet David: The righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell therein
for ever and ever.2606
And again I said: Lord, how great is the multitude of the angels? and which is the
greater, that of angels or of men? And I heard a voice saying to me: As great as is the multitude
of the angels, so great is the race of men, as the prophet has said, He set bounds to
the nations according to the number of the angels of God.2607</p>
<p>And again I said: Lord, and after that what wilt Thou do? and what is to become of the
world? Reveal to me all. And I heard a voice saying to me: Hear, righteous John. After

there are no tears, there is no envy, there is no hatred of brethren, there is no unrighteousness,

Mount Thabor. And there came a voice to me, saying: Blessed are those who keep judgment

and I shall set my throne in the place, and shall sit with the twelve apostles and the four and twenty
elders, and thou thyself an elder on account of thy blameless life; and to finish three services thou shalt receive
a white robe and an unfading crown from the hand of the Lord, and thou shalt sit with the four and twenty
elders, etc. And after this the angels shall come forth, having a golden censer and shining lamps; and they shall
gather together on the Lord’s right hand those who have lived well, and done His will, and He shall make them
to dwell for ever and ever in light and joy, and they shall obtain life everlasting. And when He shall separate
the sheep from the goats, that is, the righteous from the sinners, the righteous on the right, and the sinners on
the left; then shall He send the angel Raguel, saying: Go and sound the trumpet for the angels of cold and snow
and ice, and bring together every kind of wrath upon those that stand on the left. Because I will not pardon
them when they see the glory of God, the impious and unrepentant, and the priests who did not what was
commanded. You who have tears, weep for the sinners. And Temeluch shall call out to Taruch: Open the
punishments, thou keeper of the keys; open the judgments; open the worm that dieth not, and the wicked dragon;
make ready Hades; open the darkness; let loose the fiery river, and the frightful darkness in the depths of Hades.
Then the pitiful sinners, seeing their works, and having no consolation, shall go down weeping into streams as
it were of blood. And there is none to pity them, neither father to help, nor mother to compassionate, but rather
the angels going against them, and saying: Ye poor wretches, why are you weeping? In the world you had no
compassion on the weak, you did not help them. And these go away into everlasting punishment. There you
will not be able to bear the sight of Him who was born of the virgin; you lived unrepenting in the world, and
you will get no pity, but everlasting punishment. And Temeluch says to Taruch: Rouse up the fat three-headed
serpent; sound the trumpet for the frightful wild beasts to gather them together to feed upon them (i.e., the</note>

<head>The Book of John Concerning the Falling Asleep of Mary.</head>

<head>The Account of St. John the Theologian2615 of the Falling Asleep of the
Holy Mother of God.</head>
<p>As the all-holy glorious mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, as was her wont, was going
to the holy tomb of our Lord to burn incense, and bending her holy knees, she was importunate
that Christ our God who had been born of her should return to her. And the Jews,
seeing her lingering by the divine sepulchre, came to the chief priests, saying: Mary goes
every day to the tomb. And the chief priests, having summoned the guards set by them not
to allow any one to pray at the holy sepulchre, inquired about her, whether in truth it were
so. And the guards answered and said that they had seen no such thing, God having not
allowed them to see her when there. And on one of the days, it being the preparation, the
holy Mary, as was her wont, came to the sepulchre; and while she was praying, it came to
pass that the heavens were opened, and the archangel Gabriel came down to her and said:
Hail, thou that didst bring forth Christ our God! Thy prayer having come through to the
heavens to Him who was born of thee, has been accepted; and from this time, according to
thy request, thou having left the world, shall go to the heavenly places to thy Son, into the
true and everlasting life.</p>
<p>And having heard this from the holy archangel, she returned to holy Bethlehem, having
along with her three virgins who ministered unto her. And after having rested a short time,
she sat up and said to the virgins: Bring me a censer, that I may pray. And they brought it,
as they had been commanded. And she prayed, saying: My Lord Jesus Christ, who didst
deign through Thy supreme goodness to be born of me, hear my voice, and send me Thy
<note type="footnote">sinners); to open the twelve plagues, that all the creeping things may be brought together against the impious
and unrepenting. And Temeluch will gather together the multitude of the sinners, and will kick the earth; and
the earth will be split up in diverse places, and the sinners will be melted in frightful punishments. Then shall
God send Michael, the leader of His hosts; and having sealed the place, Temeluch shall strike them with the
previous cross, and the earth shall be brought together as before. Then their angels lamented exceedingly, then
the all-holy Virgin and all the saints wept for them, and they shall do them no good. And John says: Why are
the sinners thus punished? And I heard a voice saying to me: They walked in the world each other after his
own will, and therefore are they thus punished. Blessed is the man who reads the writing: blessed is he who has
transcribed it, and given it to other Catholic churches: blessed are all who fear God. Hear ye priests, and ye
readers; hear ye people, etc.</note>

apostle John, in order that, seeing him, I may partake of joy; and send me also the rest of
Thy apostles, both those who have already gone to Thee, and those in the world that now
is, in whatever country they may be, through Thy holy commandment, in order that, having
beheld them, I may bless Thy name much to be praised; for I am confident that Thou hearest
Thy servant in everything.</p>
<p>And while she was praying, I John came, the Holy Spirit having snatched me up by a
cloud from Ephesus, and set me in the place where the mother of my Lord was lying. And
having gone in beside her, and glorified Him who had been born of her, I said: Hail,
mother of my Lord, who didst bring forth Christ our God, rejoice that in great glory thou
art going out of this life. And the holy mother of God glorified God, because I John had
come to her, remembering the voice of the Lord, saying: Behold thy mother, and, Behold
thy son.2616 And the three virgins came and worshipped. And the holy mother of God says
to me: Pray, and cast incense. And I prayed thus: Lord Jesus Christ, who hast done wonderful
things, now also do wonderful things before her who brought Thee forth; and let Thy
mother depart from this life; and let those who crucified Thee, and who have not believed
in Thee, be confounded. And after I had ended the prayer, holy Mary said to me: Bring
me the censer. And having cast incense, she said, Glory to Thee, my God and my Lord,
because there has been fulfilled in me whatsoever Thou didst promise to me before thou
didst ascend into the heavens, that when I should depart from this world Thou wouldst
come to me, and the multitude of Thine angels, with glory. And I John say to her: Jesus
Christ our Lord and our God is coming, and thou seest2617 Him, as He promised to thee.
And the holy mother of God answered and said to me: The Jews have sworn that after I
have died they will burn my body. And I answered and said to her: Thy holy and precious
body will by no means see corruption. And she answered and said to me: Bring a censer,
and cast incense, and pray. And there came a voice out of the heavens saying the Amen.
And I John heard this voice; and the Holy Spirit said to me: John, hast thou heard this voice
that spoke in the heaven after the prayer was ended? And I answered and said: Yes, I heard.
And the Holy Spirit said to me: This voice which thou didst hear denotes that the appearance
of thy brethren the apostles is at hand, and of the holy powers that they are coming hither
to-day.</p>
<p>And at this I John prayed.</p>
<p>And the Holy Spirit said to the apostles: Let all of you together, having come by the
clouds from the ends of the world, be assembled to holy Bethlehem by a whirlwind, on account
of the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ; Peter from Rome, Paul from Tiberia,2618

Thomas from Hither India, James from Jerusalem. Andrew, Peter’s brother, and Philip,
Luke, and Simon the Cananæan, and Thaddæus who had fallen asleep, were raised by the
Holy Spirit out of their tombs; to whom the Holy Spirit said: Do not think that it is now
the resurrection; but on this account you have risen out of your tombs, that you may go to
give greeting to the honour and wonder-working of the mother of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, because the day of her departure is at hand, of her going up into the heavens.
And Mark likewise coming round, was present from Alexandria; he also with the rest, as
has been said before, from each country. And Peter being lifted up by a cloud, stood between
heaven and earth, the Holy Spirit keeping him steady. And at the same time, the rest of the
apostles also, having been snatched up in clouds, were found along with Peter. And thus
by the Holy Spirit, as has been said, they all came together.</p>
<p>And having gone in beside the mother of our Lord and God, and having adored, we
said: Fear not, nor grieve; God the Lord, who was born of thee, will take thee out of this
world with glory. And rejoicing in God her Saviour, she sat up in the bed, and says to the
apostles: Now have I believed that our Master and God is coming from heaven, and I shall
behold Him, and thus depart from this life, as I have seen that you have come. And I wish
you to tell me how you knew that I was departing and came to me, and from what countries
and through what distance you have come hither, that you have thus made haste to visit
me. For neither has He who was born of me, our Lord Jesus Christ, the God of the universe,
concealed it; for I am persuaded even now that He is the Son of the Most High.</p>
<p>And Peter answered and said to the apostles: Let us each, according to what the Holy
Spirit announced and commanded us, give full information to the mother of our Lord. And
I John answered and said: Just as I was going in to the holy altar in Ephesus to perform divine
service, the Holy Spirit says to me, The time of the departure of the mother of thy Lord is
at hand; go to Bethlehem to salute her. And a cloud of light snatched me up, and set me
down in the door where thou art lying. Peter also answered: And I, living in Rome, about
dawn heard a voice through the Holy Spirit saying to me, The mother of thy Lord is to depart,
as the time is at hand; go to Bethlehem to salute her. And, behold, a cloud of light snatched
me up; and I beheld also the other apostles coming to me on clouds, and a voice saying to
me, Go all to Bethlehem. And Paul also answered and said: And I, living in a city at no
great distance from Rome, called the country of Tiberia, heard the Holy Spirit saying to me,
The mother of thy Lord, having left this world, is making her course to the celestial regions
through her departure;2619 but go thou also to Bethlehem to salute her. And, behold, a
cloud of light having snatched me up, set me down in the same place as you. And Thomas
also answered and said: And I, traversing the country of the Indians, when the preaching
was prevailing by the grace of Christ, and the king’s sister’s son Labdanus by name, was

<pb n="1701"/>
about to be sealed by me in the palace, on a sudden the Holy Spirit says to me, Do thou also,
Thomas, go to Bethlehem to salute the mother of thy Lord, because she is taking her departure
to the heavens. And a cloud of light having snatched me up, set me down beside you. And
Mark also answered and said: And when I was finishing the canon2620 of the third day in
the city of Alexandria, just as I was praying, the Holy Spirit snatched me up, and brought
me to you. And James also answered and said: While I was in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit
commanded me, saying, Go to Bethlehem, because the mother of thy Lord is taking her
departure. And, behold, a cloud of light having snatched me up, set me beside you. And
Matthew also answered and said: I have glorified and do glorify God, because when I was
in a boat and overtaken by a storm, the sea raging with its waves, on a sudden a cloud of
light overshadowing the stormy billow, changed it to a calm, and having snatched me up,
set me down beside you. And those who had come before likewise answered, and gave an
account of how they had come. And Bartholomew said: I was in the Thebais proclaiming
the word, and behold the Holy Spirit says to me, The mother of thy Lord is taking her departure;
go, then, to salute her in Bethlehem. And, behold, a cloud of light having snatched
me up, brought me to you.</p>
<p>The apostles said all these things to the holy mother of God, why they had come, and
in what way; and she stretched her hands to heaven and prayed, saying: I adore, and praise,
and glorify Thy much to be praised name, O Lord, because Thou hast looked upon the
lowliness of Thine handmaiden, and because Thou that art mighty hast done great things
for me; and, behold, all generations shall count me blessed.2621 And after the prayer she
said to the apostles: Cast incense, and pray. And when they had prayed, there was thunder
from heaven, and there came a fearful voice, as if of chariots; and, behold, a multitude of a
host of angels and powers, and a voice, as if of the Son of man, was heard, and the seraphim
in a circle round the house where the holy, spotless mother of God and virgin was lying, so
that all who were in Bethlehem beheld all the wonderful things, and came to Jerusalem and
reported all the wonderful things that had come to pass. And it came to pass, when the
voice was heard, that the sun and the moon suddenly appeared about the house; and an assembly2622
of the first-born saints stood beside the house where the mother of the Lord was
lying, for her honour and glory. And I beheld also that many signs came to pass, the blind
seeing, the deaf hearing, the lame walking, lepers cleansed, and those possessed by unclean
spirits cured; and every one who was under disease and sickness, touching the outside of
the wall of the house where she was lying, cried out: Holy Mary, who didst bring forth

Christ our God, have mercy upon us. And they were straightway cured. And great multitudes
out of every country living in Jerusalem for the sake of prayer, having heard of the signs
that had come to pass in Bethlehem through the mother of the Lord, came to the place
seeking the cure of various diseases, which also they obtained. And there was joy unspeakable
on that day among the multitude of those who had been cured, as well as of those who
looked on, glorifying Christ our God and His mother. And all Jerusalem from Bethlehem
kept festival with psalms and spiritual songs.</p>
<p>And the priests of the Jews, along with their people, were astonished at the things which
had come to pass; and being moved2623 with the heaviest hatred, and again with frivolous
reasoning, having made an assembly, they determine to send against the holy mother of
God and the holy apostles who were there in Bethlehem. And accordingly the multitude
of the Jews, having directed their course to Bethlehem, when at the distance of one mile it
came to pass that they beheld a frightful vision, and their feet were held fast; and after this
they returned to their fellow-countrymen, and reported all the frightful vision to the chief
priests. And they, still more boiling with rage, go to the procurator, crying out and saying:
The nation of the Jews has been ruined by this woman; chase her from Bethlehem and the
province of Jerusalem. And the procurator, astonished at the wonderful things, said to
them: I will chase her neither from Bethlehem nor from any other place. And the Jews
continued crying out, and adjuring him by the health of Tiberius Cæsar to bring the apostles
out of Bethlehem. And if you do not do so, we shall report it to the Cæsar. Accordingly,
being compelled, he sends a tribune of the soldiers2624 against the apostles to Bethlehem.
And the Holy Spirit says to the apostles and the mother of the Lord: Behold, the procurator
has sent a tribune against you, the Jews having made an uproar. Go forth therefore from
Bethlehem, and fear not: for, behold, by a cloud I shall bring you to Jerusalem; for the power
of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is with you. The apostles therefore rose up
immediately, and went forth from the house, carrying the bed of the Lady the mother of
God, and directed their course to Jerusalem; and immediately, as the Holy Spirit had said,
being lifted up by a cloud, they were found in Jerusalem in the house of the Lady. And they
stood up, and for five days made an unceasing singing of praise. And when the tribune
came to Bethlehem, and found there neither the mother of the Lord nor the apostles, he
laid hold of the Bethlehemites, saying to them: Did you not come telling the procurator
and the priests all the signs and wonders that had come to pass, and how the apostles had
come out of every country? Where are they, then? Come, go to the procurator at Jerusalem.
For the tribune did not know of the departure of the apostles and the Lord’s mother to Jer-

usalem. The tribune then, having taken the Bethlehemites, went in to the procurator, saying
that he had found no one. And after five days it was known to the procurator, and the
priests, and all the city, that the Lord’s mother was in her own house in Jerusalem, along
with the apostles, from the signs and wonders that came to pass there. And a multitude of
men and women and virgins came together, and cried out: Holy virgin, that didst bring
forth Christ our God, do not forget the generation of men. And when these things came to
pass, the people of the Jews, with the priests also, being the more moved with hatred, took
wood and fire, and came up, wishing to burn the house where the Lord’s mother was living
with the apostles. And the procurator stood looking at the sight from afar off. And when
the people of the Jews came to the door of the house, behold, suddenly a power of fire
coming forth from within, by means of an angel, burnt up a great multitude of the Jews.
And there was great fear throughout all the city; and they glorified God, who had been born
of her. And when the procurator saw what had come to pass, he cried out to all the people,
saying: Truly he who was born of the virgin, whom you have thought of driving away, is
the Son of God; for these signs are those of the true God. And there was a division among
the Jews; and many believed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in consequence of the
signs that had come to pass.</p>
<p>And after all these wonderful things had come to pass through the mother of God, and
ever-virgin Mary the mother of the Lord, while we the apostles were with her in Jerusalem,
the Holy Spirit said to us: You know that on the Lord’s day the good news was brought to
the Virgin Mary by the archangel Gabriel; and on the Lord’s day the Saviour was born in
Bethlehem; and on the Lord’s day the children of Jerusalem came forth with palm branches
to meet him, saying, Hosanna in the highest, blessed is2625 He that cometh in the name of
the Lord;2626 and on the Lord’s day He rose from the dead; and on the Lord’s day He will
come to judge the living and the dead; and on the Lord’s day He will come out of heaven,
to the glory and honour of the departure of the holy glorious virgin who brought Him forth.
And on the same2627 Lord’s day the mother of the Lord says to the apostles: Cast incense,
because Christ is coming with a host of angels; and, behold, Christ is at hand, sitting on a
throne of cherubim. And while we were all praying, there appeared innumerable multitudes
of angels, and the Lord mounted upon cherubim in great power; and, behold, a stream of
light2628 coming to the holy virgin, because of the presence of her only-begotten Son, and
all the powers of the heavens fell down and adored Him. And the Lord, speaking to His
mother, said: Mary. And she answered and said: Here am I, Lord. And the Lord said to

her: Grieve not, but let thy heart rejoice and be glad; for thou hast found grace to behold
the glory given to me by my Father. And the holy mother of God looked up, and saw in
Him a glory which it is impossible for the mouth of man to speak of, or to apprehend. And
the Lord remained beside her, saying: Behold, from the present time thy precious body will
be transferred to paradise, and thy holy soul to the heavens to the treasures of my Father in
exceeding brightness, where there is peace and joy of the holy angels,—and other things
besides.2629 And the mother of the Lord answered and said to him: Lay Thy right hand
upon me, O Lord, and bless me. And the Lord stretched forth His undefiled right hand,
and blessed her. And she laid hold of His undefiled right hand, and kissed it, saying: I adore
this right hand, which created the heaven and the earth; and I call upon Thy much to be
praised name Christ, O God, the King of the ages, the only-begotten of the Father, to receive
Thine handmaid, Thou who didst deign to be brought forth by me, in a low estate, to save
the race of men through Thine ineffable dispensation; do Thou bestow Thine aid upon every
man calling upon, or praying to, or naming the name of, Thine handmaid. And while she
is saying this, the apostles, having gone up to her feet and adored, say: O mother of the
Lord, leave a blessing to the world, since thou art going away from it. For thou hast blessed
it, and raised it up when it was ruined, by bringing forth the Light of the world. And the
mother of the Lord prayed, and in her prayer spoke thus: O God, who through Thy great
goodness hast sent from the heavens Thine only-begotten Son to dwell in my humble body,
who hast deigned to be born of me, humble as I am, have mercy upon the world, and every
soul that calls upon Thy name. And again she prayed, and said: O Lord, King of the heavens,
Son of the living God, accept every man who calls upon Thy name, that Thy birth may be
glorified. And again she prayed, and said: O Lord Jesus Christ, who art all-powerful in
heaven and on earth, in this appeal I implore Thy holy name; in every time and place where
there is made mention of my name, make that place holy, and glorify those that glorify Thee
through my name, accepting of such persons all their offering, and all their supplication,
and all their prayer. And when she had thus prayed, the Lord said to His mother: Let thy
heart rejoice and be glad; for every favour2630 and every gift has been given to thee from
my Father in heaven, and from me, and from the Holy Spirit: every soul that calls upon thy
name shall not be ashamed, but shall find mercy, and comfort, and support, and confidence,
both in the world that now is, and in that which is to come, in the presence of my Father in
the heavens. And the Lord turned and said to Peter: The time has come to begin the singing
of the hymn. And Peter having begun the singing of the hymn, all the powers of the heavens
responded with the Alleluiah. And then the face of the mother of the Lord shone brighter
than the light, and she rose up and blessed each of the apostles with her own hand, and all

gave glory to God; and the Lord stretched forth His undefiled hands, and received her holy
and blameless soul. And with the departure of her blameless soul the place was filled with
perfume and ineffable light; and, behold, a voice out of the heaven was heard, saying: Blessed
art thou among women. And Peter, and I John, and Paul, and Thomas, ran and wrapped
up her precious feet for the consecration; and the twelve apostles put her precious and holy
body upon a couch, and carried it. And, behold, while they were carrying her, a certain
well-born Hebrew, Jephonias by name, running against the body, put his hands upon the
couch; and, behold, an angel of the Lord by invisible power, with a sword of fire, cut off his
two hands from his shoulders, and made them hang about the couch, lifted up in the air.
And at this miracle which had come to pass all the people of the Jews who beheld it cried
out: Verily, He that was brought forth by thee is the true God, O mother of God, ever-virgin
Mary. And Jephonias himself, when Peter ordered him, that the wonderful things of God
might be showed forth, stood up behind the couch, and cried out: Holy Mary, who
broughtest forth Christ who is God, have mercy upon me. And Peter turned and said to
him: In the name of Him who was born of her, thy hands which have been taken away from
thee, will be fixed on again. And immediately, at the word of Peter, the hands hanging by
the couch of the Lady came, and were fixed on Jephonias. And he believed, and glorified
Christ, God who had been born of her.</p>
<p>And when this miracle had been done, the apostles carried2631 the couch, and laid down
her precious and holy body in Gethsemane in a new tomb. And, behold, a perfume of sweet
savour came forth out of the holy sepulchre of our Lady the mother of God; and for three
days the voices of invisible angels were heard glorifying Christ our God, who had been born
of her. And when the third day was ended, the voices were no longer heard; and from that
time forth all knew that her spotless and precious body had been transferred to paradise.</p>
<p>And after it had been transferred, behold, we see Elisabeth the mother of St. John the
Baptist, and Anna the mother of the Lady, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David,
singing the Alleluiah, and all the choirs of the saints adoring the holy relics of the mother
of the Lord, and the place full of light, than which light nothing could be more brilliant, and
an abundance of perfume in that place to which her precious and holy body had been
transferred in paradise, and the melody of those praising Him who had been born of
her—sweet melody, of which there is no satiety, such as is given to virgins, and them only,
to hear. We apostles, therefore, having beheld the sudden precious translation of her holy
body, glorified God, who had shown us His wonders at the departure of the mother of our
Lord Jesus Christ, whose2632 prayers and good offices may we all be deemed worthy to re-

<head>Concerning the Passing2634 of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</head>
<p>In that time before the Lord came to His passion, and among many words which the
mother asked of the Son, she began to ask Him about her own departure, addressing Him
as follows:—O most dear Son, I pray Thy holiness, that when my soul goes out of my body,
Thou let me know on the third day before; and do Thou, beloved Son, with Thy angels, receive
it.2635 Then He received the prayer of His beloved mother, and said to her: O palace
and temple of the living God, O blessed mother,2636 O queen of all saints, and blessed above
all women, before thou carriedst me in thy womb, I always guarded thee, and caused thee
to be fed daily with my angelic food,2637 as thou knowest: how can I desert thee, after thou
hast carried me, and nourished me, and brought me down in flight into Egypt, and endured
many hardships for me? Know, then, that my angels have always guarded thee, and will
guard thee even until thy departure. But after I undergo suffering for men, as it is written,
and rise again on the third day, and after forty days ascend into heaven, when thou shalt
see me coming to thee2638 with angels and archangels, with saints and with virgins, and
with my disciples, know for certain that thy soul will be separated from the body, and I shall
carry it into heaven, where it shall never at all have tribulation or anguish. Then she joyed
and gloried, and kissed the knees of her Son, and blessed the Creator of heaven and earth,
who gave her such a gift through Jesus Christ her Son.</p>
<p>In the second year, therefore, after the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, the most
blessed Virgin Mary continued always in prayer day and night. And on the third day before
she passed away, an angel of the Lord came to her, and saluted her, saying: Hail, Mary, full
of grace! the Lord be with thee. And she answered, saying: Thanks to God. Again he said
to her: Receive this palm which the Lord promised to thee. And she, giving thanks to God,
with great joy received from the hand of the angel the palm sent to her. The angel of the

Lord said to her: Thy assumption will be after three days. And she answered: Thanks to
God.2639</p>
<p>Then she called Joseph of the city of Arimathæa, and the other2640 disciples of the Lord;
and when they, both relations and acquaintances, were assembled, she announced her departure
to all standing there. Then the blessed Mary washed2641 herself, and dressed herself
like a queen, and waited the advent of her Son, as He had promised to her. And she asked
all her relations to keep beside2642 her, and give her comfort. And she had along with her
three virgins, Sepphora, Abigea, and Zaël; but the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ had
been already dispersed throughout the whole world to preach to the people of God.</p>
<p>Then at the third hour2643 there were great thunders, and rains, and lightnings, and
tribulation, and an earthquake,2644 while queen Mary was standing in her chamber. John
the evangelist and apostle was suddenly brought from Ephesus, and entered the chamber
of the blessed Mary, and saluted her, and said to her: Hail, Mary, full of grace! the Lord be
with thee. And she answered: Thanks to God. And raising herself up, she kissed Saint
John. And the blessed Mary said to him: O my dearest son, why hast thou left me at such
a time, and hast not paid heed to the commands of thy Master, to take care of me, as He
commanded thee while He was hanging on the cross? And he asked pardon with bended
knee. Then the blessed Mary gave him her benediction, and again kissed him. And when
she meant to ask him whence he came, and for what reason he had come to Jerusalem, behold,
all the disciples of the Lord, except Thomas who is called Didymus, were brought by a cloud
to the door of the chamber of the blessed Mary. They stood and went in, and saluted the
queen with the following words, and adored her: Hail, Mary, full of grace! the Lord be with
thee. And she eagerly rose quickly, and bowed herself, and kissed them, and gave thanks
to God. These are the names of the disciples of the Lord who were brought thither in the
cloud: John the evangelist and James his brother, Peter and Paul, Andrew, Philip, Luke,
Barnabas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Matthias who is called Justus,2645 Simon the
Chananæan, Judas and his brother, Nicodemus and Maximianus, and many others who
cannot be numbered. Then the blessed Mary said to her brethren: What is this, that you
have all come to Jerusalem? Peter, answering, said to her: We had need to ask this of thee,

and dost thou question us? Certainly, as I think, none of us knows why we have come here
to-day with such rapidity. I was at Antioch, and now I am here. All declared plainly the
place where they had been that day. And they all wondered that they were there when they
heard these things. The blessed Mary said to them: I asked my Son, before He endured the
passion, that He and you should be at my death; and He granted me this gift. Whence you
may know that my departure will be to-morrow.2646 Watch and pray with me, that when
the Lord comes to receive my soul, He may find you watching. Then all promised that they
would watch. And they watched and prayed the whole night, with psalms and chants, with
great illuminations.</p>
<p>And when the Lord’s day came, at the third hour, just as the Holy Spirit descended upon
the apostles in a cloud,2647 so Christ descended with a multitude of angels, and received the
soul of His beloved mother. For there was such splendour and perfume of sweetness, and
angels singing the songs of songs, where the Lord says, As a lily among thorns, so is my love
among the daughters,2648 that all who were there present fell on their faces, as the apostles
fell when Christ transfigured Himself before them on Mount Thabor, and for a whole hour
and a half no one was able to rise. But when the light went away, and at the same time with
the light itself, the soul of the blessed virgin Mary was taken up into heaven with psalms,
and hymns, and songs of songs. And as the cloud went up the whole earth shook, and in
one moment all the inhabitants of Jerusalem openly saw the departure of St. Mary.</p>
<p>And that same hour Satan entered into them, and they began to consider what they
were to do with her body. And they took up weapons, that they might burn her body and
kill the apostles, because from her had gone forth the dispersions of Israel, on account of
their sins and the gathering together of the Gentiles. But they were struck with blindness,
striking their heads against the walls, and striking each other.2649 Then the apostles, alarmed
by so much brightness, arose, and with psalms carried the holy body down from Mount
Zion to the valley of Jehoshaphat. But as they were going in the middle of the road, behold,
a certain Jew,2650 Reuben by name, wishing to throw to the ground the holy bier with the
body of the blessed Mary. But his hands dried up, even to the elbow; whether he would or
not, he went down even to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, weeping and lamenting because his
hands were raised to the bier, and he was not able to draw back his hands to himself. And

he began to ask the apostles2651 that by their prayer he might be saved and made a Christian.
Then the apostles, bending their knees, asked the Lord to let him loose. And he, being healed
that same hour, giving thanks to God and kissing the feet of the queen of all the saints and
apostles, was baptized in that same place, and began to preach the name of our God Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Then the apostles with great honour laid the body in the tomb, weeping and singing
through exceeding love and sweetness. And suddenly there shone round them a light from
heaven, and they fell to the ground, and the holy body was taken up by angels into heaven.</p>
<p>Then the most blessed Thomas was suddenly brought to the Mount of Olivet, and saw
the most blessed body going up to heaven, and began to cry out and say: O holy mother,
blessed mother, spotless mother, if I have now found grace because I see thee, make thy
servant joyful through thy compassion, because thou art going to heaven. Then the girdle
with which the apostles had encircled the most holy body was thrown down from heaven
to the blessed Thomas. And taking it, and kissing it, and giving thanks to God, he came
again into the Valley of Jehoshaphat. He found all the apostles and another great crowd
there beating their breasts on account of the brightness which they had seen. And seeing
and kissing each other, the blessed Peter said to him: Truly thou hast always been obdurate
and unbelieving, because for thine unbelief it was not pleasing to God that thou shouldst
be along with us at the burial of the mother of the Saviour. And he, beating his breast, said:
I know and firmly believe that I have always been a bad and an unbelieving man; therefore
I ask pardon of all of you for my obduracy and unbelief. And they all prayed for him. Then
the blessed Thomas said: Where have you laid her body? And they pointed out the sepulchre
with their finger. And he said: The body which is called most holy is not there. Then the
blessed Peter said to him: Already on another occasion thou wouldst not believe the resurrection
of our Master and Lord at our word, unless thou went to touch Him with thy fingers,
and see Him; how wilt thou believe us that the holy body is here? Still he persists saying:
It is not here. Then, as it were in a rage, they went to the sepulchre, which was a new one
hollowed out in the rock, and took up the stone; but they did not find the body, not knowing
what to say, because they had been convicted by the words of Thomas. Then the blessed
Thomas told them how he was singing mass in India—he still had on his sacerdotal robes.
He, not knowing the word of God, had been brought to the Mount of Olivet, and saw the
most holy body of the blessed Mary going up into heaven, and prayed her to give him a
blessing. She heard his prayer, and threw him her girdle which she had about her. And the
apostles seeing the belt which they had put about her, glorifying God, all asked pardon of
the blessed Thomas, on account of the benediction which the blessed Mary had given him,
<note type="footnote">2651 ms. C adds: and firmly to promise that, if he were made whole by their prayers, he would become a
Christian.</note>

<pb n="1711"/>
and because he had seen the most holy body going up into heaven. And the blessed Thomas
gave them his benediction, and said: Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren
to dwell together in unity!2652</p>
<p>And the same cloud by which they had been brought carried them back each to his own
place, just like Philip when he baptized the eunuch, as is read in the Acts of the Apostles;2653
and as Habakkuk the prophet carried food to Daniel, who was in the lions’ den, and quickly
returned to Judæa.2654 And so also the apostles quickly returned to where they had at first
been, to preach to the people of God. Nor is it to be wondered at that He should do such
things, who went into the virgin and came out of her though her womb was closed; who,
though the gates were shut, went in to His disciples;2655 who made the deaf to hear, raised
the dead, cleansed the lepers, gave sight to the blind,2656 and did many other wonderful
things. To believe this is no doubtful matter.</p>
<p>I am Joseph who laid the Lord’s body in my sepulchre, and saw Him rising again; and
who, before the ascension and after the ascension of the Lord, always kept his most sacred
temple the blessed ever-virgin Mary, and who have kept in writing and in my breast the
things which came forth from the mouth of God, and how the things mentioned above were
done by the judgment of God. And I have made known to all, Jews and Gentiles, those
things which I saw with my eyes, and heard with my ears; and as long as I live I shall not
cease to declare them. And her, whose assumption is at this day venerated and worshipped
throughout the whole world, let us assiduously entreat that she be mindful of us in the
presence of her most pious Son in heaven, to whom is praise and glory through endless ages
of ages. Amen.2657</p>

<head>Here Beginneth the Passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</head>
<p>1.2658 Therefore, when the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was hanging on the tree
fastened by the nails of the cross for the life of the whole world, He saw about the cross His
mother standing, and John the evangelist, whom He peculiarly loved above the rest of the
apostles, because he alone of them was a virgin in the body. He gave him, therefore, the
charge of holy Mary, saying to him: Behold thy mother! and saying, to her: Behold thy
son!2659 From that hour the holy mother of God remained specially in the care of John, as
long as she had her habitation in this life. And when the apostles had divided the world by
lot for preaching, she settled in the house of his parents near Mount Olivet.</p>
<p>2. In the second year, therefore, after Christ had vanquished death, and ascended up
into heaven, on a certain day, Mary, burning with a longing for Christ, began to weep alone,
within the shelter of her abode. And, behold, an angel, shining in a dress of great light,
stood before her and gave utterance to2660 the words of salutation saying: Hail! thou blessed
by the Lord, receive the salutation of Him who commanded safety to Jacob by His prophets.
Behold, said He, a palm branch—I have brought it to thee from the paradise of the
Lord—which thou wilt cause to be carried before thy bier, when on the third day thou shalt
be taken up from the body. For, lo, thy Son awaits thee with thrones and angels, and all the
powers of heaven. Then Mary said to the angel: I beg that all the apostles of the Lord Jesus
<note type="footnote">2658 The otherms. has the following introductory chapter: Melito, servant of Christ, bishop of the church
of Sardis, to the venerable brethren in the Lord appointed at Laodicea, in peace greeting. I remember that I have
often written of one Leucius, who, having along with ourselves associated with the apostles, turned aside through
alienated feelings and a rash soul from the path of rectitude, and inserted very many things in his books about
the acts of the apostles. Of their powers, indeed, he said many and diverse things; but of their teaching he gave
a very false account, affirming that they taught otherwise than they did, and establishing his own impious
statements, as it were, by their words. Nor did he think this to be enough; but he even vitiated, by his impious
writing, the assumption of the blessed ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, to such a degree that it would be
impious not only to read it in the church of God, but even to hear it. When you ask us, therefore, what we heard
from the Apostle John, we simply write this, and have directed it to your brotherhood; believing, not the strange
dogmas hatched by heretics, but the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, while the threefold person of the
Godhead and undivided substance remains; believing not that two human natures were created by a good God,
which by the craft of the serpent was vitiated through sin, and restored through the grace of Christ. [Tischendorf

Christ be assembled to me. To whom the angel said: Behold, to-day, by the power of my
Lord Jesus Christ, all the apostles will come to thee. And Mary says to him: I ask that thou
send upon me thy blessing, that no power of the lower world may withstand me in that hour
in which my soul shall go out of my body, and that I may not see the prince of darkness.
And the angel said: No power indeed of the lower world will hurt thee; and thy Lord God,
whose servant and messenger I am, hath given thee eternal blessing; but do not think that
the privilege of not seeing the prince of darkness is to be given thee by me, but by Him whom
thou hast carried in thy womb; for to Him belongeth power over all for ever and ever. Thus
saying, the angel departed with great splendour. And that palm shone with exceeding great
light. Then Mary, undressing herself, put on better garments. And, taking the palm which
she had received from the hands of the angel, she went out to the mount of Olivet, and began
to pray, and say: I had not been worthy, O Lord, to bear Thee, unless Thou hadst had
compassion on me; but nevertheless I have kept the treasure which Thou entrustedst to me.
Therefore I ask of Thee, O King of glory, that the power of Gehenna hurt me not. For if the
heavens and the angels daily tremble before Thee, how much more man who is made from
the ground, who possesses no good thing, except as much as he has received from Thy benignant
bounty! Thou art, O Lord, God always blessed for ever. And thus saying, she went
back to her dwelling.</p>
<p>3. And, behold, suddenly, while St. John was preaching in Ephesus, on the Lord’s day,
at the third hour of the day, there was a great earthquake, and a cloud raised him and took
him up from the eyes of all, and brought him before the door of the house where Mary was.
And knocking at the door, he immediately went in. And when Mary saw him, she exulted
in joy, and said: I beg of thee, my son John, be mindful of the words of my Lord Jesus Christ,
in which He entrusted me to thee. For, behold, on the third day, when I am to depart from
the body,2661 I have heard the plans of the Jews, saying, Let us wait for the day when she
who bore that seducer shall die, and let us burn her body with fire. She therefore called St.
John, and led him into the secret chamber of the house, and showed him the robe of her
burial, and that palm of light which she had received from the angel, instructing him that
he should cause it to be carried before her couch when she was going to her tomb.</p>
<p>4. And St. John said to her: How shall I alone perform thy funeral rites, unless my
brethren and fellow-apostles of my Lord Jesus Christ come to pay honour to thy body?
And, behold, on a sudden, by the command of God, all the apostles were snatched up, raised
on a cloud, from the places in which they were preaching the word of God, and set down
<note type="footnote">2661 The otherms. has a better reading: For, behold, on the third day I am to depart from the body; and I
have heard, etc.</note>

<pb n="1715"/>
before the door of the house in which Mary dwelt. And, saluting each other, they wondered,
saying: What is the cause for which the Lord hath assembled us here?2662</p>
<p>5. Then all the apostles, rejoicing2663 with one mind, finished their prayer. And when
they had said the Amen, behold, on a sudden, there came the blessed John, and told them
all these things. The apostles then, having entered the house, found Mary, and saluted her,
saying: Blessed art thou by the Lord, who hath made heaven and earth. And she said to
them: Peace be with you, most beloved brethren! How have you come hither? And they
recounted to her how they had come, each one raised on a cloud by the Spirit of God, and
set down in the same place. And she said to them: God hath not deprived me of the sight
of you. Behold, I shall go the way of all the earth, and I doubt not that the Lord hath now
conducted you hither to bring me consolation for the anguish which is just coming upon
me. Now therefore I implore you, that without intermission you all with one mind watch,
even till that hour in which the Lord will come, and I shall depart from the body.</p>
<p>6. And when they had sat down in a circle consoling her, when they had spent three
days in the praises of God, behold, on the third day, about the third hour of the day, a deep
sleep seized upon all who were in that house, and no one was at all able to keep awake but
the apostles alone, and only the three virgins who were there. And, behold, suddenly the
Lord Jesus Christ came with a great multitude of angels; and a great brightness came down
upon that place, and the angels were singing a hymn, and praising God together. Then the
Saviour spoke, saying: Come, most precious pearl, within the receptacle of life eternal.</p>
<p>7. Then Mary prostrated herself on the pavement, adoring God, and said: Blessed be
the name of Thy glory, O Lord my God, who hast deigned to choose me Thine handmaid,
and to entrust to me Thy hidden mystery. Be mindful of me, therefore, O King of glory,
for Thou knowest that I have loved Thee with all my heart, and kept the treasure committed
to me. Therefore receive me, Thy servant, and free me from the power of darkness, that no
onset of Satan may oppose me, and that I may not see filthy spirits standing in my way.
And the Saviour answered her: When I, sent by my Father for the salvation of the world,
was hanging on the cross, the prince of darkness came to me; but when he was able to find
<note type="footnote">2662 The otherms. here adds: And there came with them Paul, converted from the circumcision, who had
been selected along with Barnabas for the ministry of the Gentiles. And when there was a pious contention
among them as to which of them should be the first to pray to the Lord to show them the reason, and Peter was
urging Paul to pray first, Paul answered and said: That is thy duty, to begin first, especially seeing that thou hast
been chosen by God a pillar (Gal. ii. 9) of the Church, and thou hast precedence of all in the apostleship; but it
is by no means mine, for I am the least of you all, and Christ was seen by me as one born out of due time (1 Cor.
xv. 8); nor do I presume to make myself equal to you: nevertheless by the grace of God I am what I am (1 Cor.
xv. 10).</note>

in me no trace of his work,2664 he went off vanquished and trodden under foot. But when
thou shalt see him, thou shalt see him indeed by the law of the human race, in accordance
with which thou hast come to the end of thy life; but he cannot hurt thee, because I am with
thee to help thee. Go in security, because the heavenly host is waiting for thee to lead thee
in to the joys of paradise. And when the Lord had thus spoken, Mary, rising from the
pavement, reclined upon her couch, and giving thanks to God, gave up the ghost. And the
apostles saw that her soul was of such whiteness, that no tongue of mortals can worthily
utter it; for it surpassed all the whiteness of snow, and of every metal, and of gleaming silver,
by the great brightness of its light.</p>
<p>8. Then the Saviour spoke, saying: Rise, Peter, and take the body of Mary, and send it
to the right hand side of the city towards the east, and thou wilt find there a new tomb, in
which you will lay her, and wait until I come to you. And thus saying, the Lord delivered
the soul of St. Mary to Michael, who was the ruler of paradise, and the prince of the nation
of the Jews;2665 and Gabriel went with them. And immediately the Saviour was received
up into heaven along with the angels.</p>
<p>9. And the three virgins, who were in the same place, and were watching, took up the
body of the blessed Mary, that they might wash it after the manner of funeral rites. And
when they had taken off her clothes, that sacred body shone with so much brightness, that
it could be touched indeed for preparation for burial, but the form of it could not be seen
for the excessive flashing light: except that the splendour of the Lord appeared great, and
nothing was perceived, the body, when it was washed, was perfectly clean, and stained by
no moisture of filth.2666 And when they had put the dead-clothes on her, that light was
gradually obscured. And the body of the blessed Mary was like lily flowers; and an odour
of great sweetness came forth from it, so that no sweetness could be found like it.</p>
<p>10. Then, accordingly, the apostles laid the holy body on the bier, and said to each
other: Who is to carry this palm before her bier? Then John said to Peter: Thou, who hast
precedence of us in the apostleship, shouldst carry this palm before her couch. And Peter
answered him: Thou wast the only virgin among us chosen by the Lord, and thou didst
find so great favour that thou didst recline upon His breast.2667 And He, when for our salvation
He was hanging upon the stem of the cross, entrusted her to thee with His own
mouth. Thou therefore oughtest to carry this palm, and let us take up that body to carry it

even to the place of sepulture.2668 After this, Peter, raising it, and saying, Take the body,
began to sing and say: Israel hath gone forth out of Egypt. Alleluiah. And the other apostles
along with him carried the body of the blessed Mary, and John bore the palm of light before
the bier. And the other apostles sang with a most sweet voice.</p>
<p>11. And, behold, a new miracle. There appeared above the bier a cloud exceeding great,
like the great circle which is wont to appear beside the splendour of the moon; and there
was in the clouds an army of angels sending forth a sweet song,2669 and from the sound of
the great sweetness the earth resounded. Then the people, having gone forth from the city,
about fifteen thousand, wondered, saying: What is that sound of so great sweetness? Then
there stood up one who said to them: Mary has departed from the body, and the disciples
of Jesus are singing2670 praises around her. And looking, they saw the couch crowned with
great glory, and the apostles singing with a loud voice. And, behold, one of them, who was
chief of the priests of the Jews in his rank, filled with fury and rage, said to the rest: Behold,
the tabernacle of him who disturbed us and all our race, what glory has it received? And
going up, he wished to overturn the bier, and throw the body down to the ground. And
immediately his hands dried up from his elbows, and stuck to the couch. And when the
apostles raised the bier, part of him hung, and part of him adhered to the couch; and he was
vehemently tormented with pain, while the apostles were walking and singing. And the
angels who were in the clouds smote the people with blindness.</p>
<p>12. Then that chief cried out, saying: I implore thee, Saint Peter, do not despise me, I
beseech thee, in so great an extremity, because I am exceedingly tortured by great torments.
Bear in mind that when, in the prætorium, the maid that kept the door2671 recognised thee,
and told the others to revile thee, then I spoke good words in thy behalf. Then Peter answering,
said: It is not for me to give other to thee; but if thou believest with thy whole heart on
the Lord Jesus Christ, whom she carried in her womb, and remained a virgin after the birth,
the compassion of the Lord, which with profuse benignity saves2672 the unworthy, will give
thee salvation.2673</p>
<p>To this he replied: Do we not believe? But what shall we do? The enemy of the human
race has blinded our hearts, and confusion has covered our face, lest we should confess the
great things of God, especially when we ourselves uttered maledictions against Christ,
<note type="footnote">2668 The otherms. inserts: And Paul said to him: And I, who am younger than any of you, will carry along
with thee. And when all had agreed, Peter, raising the bier at the head, began to sing and say.</note>

shouting: His blood be upon us, and upon our children.2674 Then Peter said: Behold, this
malediction will hurt him who has remained unfaithful to Him; but to those who turn
themselves to God mercy is not denied. And he said: I believe all that thou sayest to me;
only I implore, have mercy upon me, lest I die.</p>
<p>13. Then Peter made the couch stand still, and said to him: If thou believest with all
thy heart upon the Lord Jesus Christ, thy hands will be released from the bier. And when
he had said this2675 his hands were immediately released from the bier, and he began to
stand on his feet; but his arms were dried up, and the torture did not go away from him.
Then Peter said to him: Go up to the body, and kiss the couch, and say: I believe in God,
and in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom she bore, and I believe all whatsoever Peter the
apostle of God has said to me. And going up, he kissed the couch, and immediately all pain
went away from him, and his hands were healed. Then he began greatly to bless God, and
from the books of Moses to render testimony to the praises of Christ, so that even the apostles
themselves wondered, and wept for joy, praising the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>14. And Peter said to him: Take this palm from the hand of our brother John, and going
into the city thou wilt find much people blinded, and declare to them the great things of
God; and whosoever shall believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt put this palm upon
their eyes, and they shall see; but those who will not believe shall remain blind. And when
he had done so, he found much people blinded, lamenting thus: Woe unto us, because we
have been made like the Sodomites struck with blindness.2676 Nothing now is left to us but
to perish. But when they heard the words of the chief who had been cured speaking, they
believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; and when he put the palm over their eyes, they recovered
sight. Five of them remaining in hardness of heart died. And the chief of the priests going
forth, carried back the palm to the apostles, reporting all things whatsoever had been done.</p>
<p>15. And the apostles, carrying Mary, came to the place of the Valley of Jehoshaphat
which the Lord had showed them; and they laid her in a new tomb, and closed the sepulchre.
And they themselves sat down at the door of the tomb, as the Lord had commanded them;
and, behold, suddenly the Lord Jesus Christ came with a great multitude of angels, with a
halo of great brightness gleaming, and said to the apostles: Peace be with you! And they
answered and said: Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in Thee.2677
Then the Saviour spoke to them, saying: Before I ascended to my Father I promised to you,
saying that you who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit
upon the throne of His majesty, will sit, you also, upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve

tribes of Israel.2678 Her, therefore, did I choose out of the tribes of Israel by the command
of my Father, that I should dwell in her. What, therefore, do you wish that I should do to
her? Then Peter and the other apostles said: Lord, Thou didst choose beforehand this Thine
handmaid to become a spotless chamber for Thyself, and us Thy servants to minister unto
Thee. Before the ages Thou didst foreknow all things along with the Father, with whom to
Thee and the Holy Spirit there is one Godhead, equal and infinite power. If, therefore, it
were possible to be done in the presence of the power of Thy grace, it had seemed to us Thy
servants to be right that, just as Thou, having vanquished death, reignest in glory, so, raising
up again the body of Thy mother, Thou shouldst take her with Thee in joy into heaven.</p>
<p>16. Then the Saviour said: Let it be according to your opinion. And He ordered the
archangel Michael to bring the soul of St. Mary. And, behold, the archangel Michael2679
rolled back the stone from the door of the tomb; and the Lord said: Arise, my beloved and
my nearest relation; thou who hast not put on corruption by intercourse with man, suffer
not destruction of the body in the sepulchre. And immediately Mary rose from the tomb,
and blessed the Lord, and falling forward at the feet of the Lord, adored Him, saying: I
cannot render sufficient thanks to Thee, O Lord, for Thy boundless benefits which Thou
hast deigned to bestow upon me Thine handmaiden. May Thy name, O Redeemer of the
world, God of Israel, be blessed for ever.</p>
<p>17. And kissing her, the Lord went back, and delivered her soul to the angels, that they
should carry it into paradise. And He said to the apostles: Come up to me. And when they
had come up He kissed them, and said: Peace be to you! as I have always been with you, so
will I be even to the end of the world. And immediately, when the Lord had said this, He
was lifted up on a cloud, and taken back into heaven, and the angels along with Him, carrying
the blessed Mary into the paradise of God. And the apostles being taken up in the clouds,
returned each into the place allotted2680 for his preaching, telling the great things of God,
and praising our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, in perfect unity, and in one substance of Godhead, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="1721"/>
<head>Introductory Notice
to
The Decretals.</head>
<p>The learned editors of the Edinburgh series have given us only a specimen of these
frauds, which, pretending to be a series of “papal edicts” from Clement and his successors
during the ante-Nicene ages, are, in fact, the manufactured product of the ninth century,—the
most stupendous imposture of the world’s history, the most successful and the most stubborn
in its hold upon enlightened nations. Like the mason’s framework of lath and scantlings,
on which he turns an arch of massive stone, the Decretals served their purpose, enabling
Nicholas I. to found the Papacy by their insignificant aid. That swelling arch of vanity once
reared, the framework might be knocked out; but the fabric stood, and has borne up every
weight imposed upon it for ages. Its strong abutments have been ignorance and despotism.
Nicholas produced his flimsy framework of imposture, and amazed the whole Church by
the audacity of the claims he founded upon it. The age, however, was unlearned and uncritical;
and, in spite of remonstrances from France under lead of Hincmar, bishop of Rheims,
the West patiently submitted to the overthrow of the ancient Canons and the Nicene Constitutions,
and bowed to the yoke of a new canon-law, of which these frauds were not only
made an integral, but the essential, part. The East never accepted them for a moment: her
great patriarchates retain the Nicene System to this day. But, as the established religion of
the “Holy Roman Empire,” the national churches of Western Europe, one by one, succumbed
to this revolt from historic Catholicity. The Eastern churches were the more numerous.
They stood by the Constitutions confirmed by all the OEcumenical Synods; they altered not
a word of the Nicene Creed; they stood up for the great Catholic law, “Let the ancient customs
prevail;” and they were, and are to this day, the grand historic stem of Christendom. The
Papacy created the Western schism, and contrived to call it “the schism of the Greeks.” The
Decretals had created the Papacy, and they enabled the first Pope to assume that communion
with himself was the test of Catholic communion: hence his excommunication of the
Easterns, which, after brief intervals of relaxation, settled into the chronic schism of the
Papacy, and produced the awful history of the mediæval Church in Western Europe.</p>
<p>In naming Nicholas I. as the founder of the Papacy, and the first Pope, I merely reach
the logical consequence of admitted facts and demonstrated truths. I merely apply the recognised
principles of modern thought and scientific law to the science of history, and dismiss
the technology of empiricism in this science, as our age has abolished similar empiricisms
in the exact sciences. For ages after Copernicus, even those who basked in the light of the

true system of the universe went on in the old ruts, talking as if the Ptolemaic theory were
yet a reality: and so the very historians whose lucid pages explode the whole fabric of the
Papal communion, still go on, in the language of fable, giving to the early Bishops of Rome
the title of “Popes;” counting St. Peter as the first Pope; bewildering the student by many
confusions of fact with fable; and conceding to the modern fabric of Romanism the name
of “the Catholic Church,” with all the immense advantages that accrue to falsehood by such
a surrender of truth, and the consequent endowment of imposture with the raiment and
the domain of Apostolic antiquity.</p>
<p>The student of this series must have noted the following fundamental facts:—</p>
<p>1. That the name papa was common to all bishops, and signified no pre-eminence in
those who bore it.</p>
<p>2. That the Apostolic Sees were all equally accounted matrices of unity, and the roots
of other Catholic churches.</p>
<p>3. That, down to the Council of Nicæa, the whole system of the Church was framed on
this principle, and that these were the “ancient customs” which that council ordained to be
perpetual.</p>
<p>4. That “because it was the old capital of the empire,” and for no other reason (the Petrine
idea never once mentioned), the primacy of honour was conceded to Old Rome, and equal
honour to New Rome, because it was the new capital.2681 It was to be named second on
the list of patriarchates, but to be in no wise inferior to Old Rome; while the ancient and
all-commanding patriarchate of Alexandria yielded this credit to the parvenu of Byzantium
only on the principle of the Gospel, “in honour preferring one another,” and only because
the imperial capital must be the centre of Catholic concourse.</p>
<p>Now, the rest of the story must be sought in post-Nicene history. The salient points are
as follows:—</p>
<p>1. The mighty centralization about Constantinople; the three councils held within its
walls; the virtual session of the other councils under its eaves; the inconsiderable figure of
“Old Rome” in strictly ecclesiastical history; her barrenness of literature, and of great heroic
sons, like Athanasius and Chrysostom in the East, and Cyprian and Augustine in the West;
and her decadence as a capital,—had led Leo I., and others after him, to dwell much upon
“St. Peter,” and to favour new ideas of his personal greatness, and of a transmitted grandeur
as the inheritance of his successors. As yet, these were but “great swelling words of vanity;”
but they led to the formulated fraud of the Decretals.</p>
<p>2. Ambition once entering the pale of Catholicity, we find a counter idea to that of the
councils at the root of the first usurpation of unscriptural dignity. John “the Faster,” bishop
of New Rome, conceived himself not merely equal (as the councils had decreed) to the
<note type="footnote">2681 Compare these Canons: Nicæa, vi.; Constantinople, ii., iii.; Ephesus, viii.; and Chalcedon, xxviii.</note>

<pb n="1723"/>
bishop of Old Rome, but his superior, in view of the decrepitude of the latter, and its occupation
by the Goths, while the imperial dignity of Constantinople was now matured. He
called himself “OEcumenical Bishop.”</p>
<p>3. Gregory was then bishop of “Old Rome,” and that was the time to assert the principle
of the Decretals, had any such idea ever been heard of. How did he meet his brother’s arrogance?
Not appealing to decretals, not by asserting that such was his own dignity derived
from St. Peter, but by protesting against such abasement of all the other patriarchs and all
other bishops (who were all equals), and by pronouncing the impious assumption of such
a nefarious title to denote a “forerunner of Antichrist.” Plainly, then, there was no “Pope”
known to Christendom at the close of the sixth century.</p>
<p>4. But hardly was Gregory in his grave when court policy led the Emperor Phocas (one
of the most infamous of men) to gratify the wicked ambition of the new Bishop of Rome
by giving to him the titular honour of being a “forerunner of Antichrist.” Boniface III. (607
a.d.) assumed the daring title of “Universal Bishop.” But it was a mere court-title: the
Church never recognised it; and so it went down to his successors as mere “sounding brass
and a tinkling cymbal” till the days of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>5. In his times the Petrine fable had grown upon the Western mind. All Western Europe
had but one Apostolic See. As “the Apostolic See” it was known throughout the West, just
as “the Post-Office” means that which is nearest to one’s own dwelling. What was geographically
true, had grown to be theologically false, however; and the Bishop of Rome began to
consider himself the only inheritor of Apostolic precedency, if not of all Apostolic authority
and power.</p>
<p>6. The formation of the Western Empire favoured this assumption: but it did not take
definite shape while Charlemagne lived, for he regarded himself, like Constantine, the “head
of the Church;”2682 and in his day he acted as supreme pontiff, called the Council of
Frankfort, overruled the Roman bishop, and, in short, was a lay-Pope throughout his empire.
That nobody refused him all he claimed, that Adrian “couched like a strong ass” under the
burden of his rebukes, and that Leo paid him bodily “homage,” demonstrated that no such
character as a “Pope” was yet in existence. Leo III. had personally “adored” Charlemagne
with the homage afterwards rendered to the pontiffs, and Adrian had set him the example
of personal submission.</p>
<p>7. But, Charlemagne’s feeble sons and successors proving incapable of exercising his
power, the West only waited for an ambitious and original genius to come to the See of
Rome, to yield him all that Charlemagne had claimed, and to invest him with the more
sacred character of the Apostolic head to the whole Church.</p>
<note type="footnote">2682 Episcopus ab extra; i.e., head of temporalities.</note>

<pb n="1724"/>
<p>8. Such a character arose in Nicholas I. He found the Decretals made to his hand by
some impostor, and he saw a benighted age ready to accept his assumptions. He therefore
used them, and passed them into the organic canon-law of the West. The “Holy Roman
Empire” reluctantly received the impious frauds2683 the East contemptuously resisted. Thus
the Papacy was formed on the base of the “Holy Roman Empire,” and arrogated to itself the
right to cut off and anathematize the greater part of Christendom, with the old patriarchal
Sees. So we have in Nicholas the first figure in history in whose person is concentrated what
Rome means by the Papacy. No “Pope” ever existed previously, in the sense of her canonlaw;
and it was not till two centuries longer that even a “Pope” presumed to pronounce that
title peculiar to the Bishop of Rome.2684</p>
<p>Such, then, are the historical facts, which render vastly important some study of the
Decretals. I shall give what follows exclusively from “Roman-Catholic” sources. Says the
learned Dupin:2685—</p>
<p>1. All these Decretals were unknown to all the ancient Fathers, to all the Popes and all
the ecclesiastical authors that wrote before the ninth century. Now, what rational man can
believe that so vast a number of letters, composed by so many holy Popes, containing so
many important points in relation to the discipline of the Church, could be unknown to
Eusebius, to St. Jerome, to St. Augustine, to St. Basil, and, in short, to all those authors that
have spoken of their writings, or who have written upon the discipline of the Church? Could
it possibly happen that the Popes, to whom these epistles are so very favourable, would
never have cited and alleged them to aggrandize their own reputation? Who could ever
imagine that the decisions of these Decretals should be never so much as quoted in any
council or in any canon? He that will seriously consider with himself, that, since these Decretals
have been imposed upon the world, they have been cited in an infinite number of
places by Popes, by councils, and as often by canonists, will be readily convinced that they
would have acquired immense credit, and been very often quoted by antiquity, if they had
been genuine and true.</p>
<p>Here I must direct attention to the all-important fact, that whatever may have been the
authorship of these forgeries, the Roman pontiffs, and the “Roman Catholic” communion
as such, have committed themselves over and over again to the fraud, as Dupin remarks
above, and that, long after the imposture was demonstrated and exposed; in proof of which
I cite the following, from one whose eyes were opened by his patient investigation of such

<pb n="1725"/>
facts, but who, while a member of the Roman communion, wrote to his co-religionist Cardinal
Manning as follows:2686—</p>
<p>Is it credible that the Papacy should have so often appealed to these forgeries for its extended
claims, had it any better authorities—distinctive authorities—to fall back upon?
Every disputant on the Latin side finds in these forgeries a convincing argument against the
Greeks. ‘To prove this,’ the universal jurisdiction of the Pope, said Abbot Barlaam, himself
converted by them from the Greek Church, to convert his countrymen, ‘one need only look
through the decretal epistles of the Roman pontiffs from St. Clement to St. Sylvester.’ In
the twenty-fifth session of the Council of Florence the provincial of the Dominicans is
ordered to address the Greeks on the rights of the Pope, the Pope being present. Twice he
argues from the pseudo-decretal of St. Anacletus, at another time from a synodical letter of
St. Athanasius to Felix, at another time from a letter of Julius to the Easterns, all forgeries.
Afterwards, in reply to objections taken by Bessarion, in conference, to their authority, apart
from any question of their authenticity, his position in another speech is, ‘that those decretal
epistles of the Popes, being synodical epistles in each case, are entitled to the same authority
as the Canons themselves.’ Can we need further evidence of the weight attached to them
on the Latin side?</p>
<p>“Popes appealed to them in their official capacity, as well as private doctors; (1) Leo IX.,
for instance, to the pseudo-donation in the prolix epistle written by him, or in his name, to
Michael Cerularius, patriarch of Constantinople, on the eve of the schism. (2) Eugenius
IV. to the pseudo-decretals of St. Alexander and Julius, during the negotiations for healing
it, in his instructions to the Armenians. (3) But why, my lord, need I travel any further for
proofs, when in the Catechism of the Council of Trent, that has been for three centuries the
accredited instructor of the clergy themselves, recommended authoritatively by so many Popes,
notwithstanding the real value of these miserable impostures had been for three centuries
before the world, I find these words:2687 ‘On the primacy of the Supreme Pontiff, see the
third epistle (that is, pseudo-decretal) of Anacletus’! Such is, actually, the authority to which
the clergy of our own days are referred, in the first instance, for sound and true views on the
primacy. (4) Afterwards, when they have mastered what is said there, they may turn to
three more authorities, all culled likewise from Gratian, which they will not fail to interpret
in accordance with the ideas they have already imbibed. Nor can I refrain from calling attention
to a much more flagrant case. On the sacrament of confirmation there had been
many questions raised by the Reformers, calculated to set people thinking, and anxious to
know the strict truth respecting it. On this the Catechism proceeds as follows:2688—</p>
<note type="footnote">2686 Ed. Hayes, London, 1868.</note>
<note type="footnote">2687 De Ord. Sacram., § 49.</note>
<note type="footnote">2688 § 5.</note>

<pb n="1726"/>
<p>“‘Since it has been already shown how necessary it would be to teach generally respecting
all the sacraments, by whom they were instituted, so there is need of similar instruction respecting
confirmation, that the faithful may be the more attracted by the holiness of this
sacrament. Pastors must therefore explain that not only was Christ our Lord the author of
it, but that, on the authority of the Roman pontiff St. Fabian (i.e., the pseudo-decretal attributed
to him), He instituted the rite of the chrism, and the words used by the Catholic Church
in its administration.’</p>
<p>“Strange phenomenon, indeed, that the asseverations of such authorities should be still
ordered to be taught as Gospel from our pulpits in these days, when everybody that is acquainted
with the merest rudiments of ecclesiastical history knows how absolutely unauthenticated
they are in point of fact, and how unquestionably the authorities cited to prove them are
forgeries.</p>
<p>“Absolutely, my lord, with such evidence before me, I am unable to resist the inference
that truthfulness is not one of the strongest characteristics of the teaching of even the modern
Church of Rome; for is not this a case palpably where its highest living authorities are both
indifferent to having possible untruths preached from the pulpit, and something more than
indifferent to having forgeries, after their detection as such, adduced from the pulpit to authenticate
facts?</p>
<p>“This, again, strongly reminds me of a conversation I had with the excellent French
priest who received me into the Roman-Catholic Church, some time subsequently to that
event. I had, as an Anglican, inquired very laboriously into the genuineness of the Santa
Casa: and having visited Nazareth and Loretto since, and plunged into the question anew
at each place, came back more thoroughly convinced than ever of its utterly fictitious character,
notwithstanding the privileges bestowed upon it by so many Popes. On stating my
convictions to him, his only reply was: ‘There are many things in the Breviary which I do
not believe, myself.’ Oh the stumbling-blocks of a system in the construction of which forgeries
have been so largely used, in which it is still thought possible for the clergy to derive
edification from legends which they cannot believe, and the people instruction from works
of acknowledged imposture!</p>
<p>Further, Dupin remarks:2689—</p>
<p>“The first man that published them, if we may believe Hincmar, was one Riculphus,
bishop of Mentz, who died about the ninth century. It is commonly believed, seeing the
collection bears the name of Isidore, that he brought them from Spain. But it never could
have been composed by the great Archbishop of Seville; and there is great reason to believe
that no Spaniard, but rather some German or Frenchman, began this imposture,</p>
<note type="footnote">2689 P. 173, as above.</note>

<pb n="1727"/>
<p>“It likewise seems probable that some of these Decretals have been foisted in since the
time of Riculphus. Benedict, a deacon of the church of Mentz, who made a collection of
canons for the successors of Riculphus, may have put the last hand to this collection of false
Decretals attributed to one Isidore, a different person from the famous Bishop of Seville,
and surnamed Peccator, or Mercator. About his time a certain Isidore did come from Spain,
along with some merchants, and then withdrew to Mentz. Not improbably, therefore, this
man’s name was given to the collection, and it was naturally believed that it was brought
from Spain.</p>
<p>“And since these letters first appeared in an unlearned, dark age, what wonder is it that
they were received with very little opposition? And yet Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims,
with other French bishops, made great difficulty in accepting them, even in that time. Soon
after, however, they acquired some authority, owing to the support of the court of Rome,
the pretensions of which they mightily favoured.</p>
<p>On the twin imposture of the “Donation of Constantine,” it may be well to cite the same
learned authority. But this shall be found elsewhere.2690</p>
<p>Let me now recur to the same candid Gallican doctor, Dupin, who remarks as follows:—</p>
<p>“2. The imposture of these letters is invincibly proved from hence: because they are
made up of a contexture of passages out of Fathers, councils, papal epistles, and imperial
ordinances, which have appeared after the third century, down to the middle of the ninth.</p>
<p>“3. The citations of Scripture in all these letters follow the Vulgate of St. Jerome, which
demonstrates that they are since his time (a.d. 420), and consequently do not proceed from
Popes who lived long before St. Jerome.</p>
<p>“4. The matter of these letters is not at all in keeping with the ages when those to whom
they are attributed were living.</p>
<p>“5. These Decretals are full of anachronisms. The consulships and names of consuls
mentioned in them are confused and out of order; and, moreover, the true dates of the
writers themselves, as Bishops of Rome, do not agree with those assumed in these letters.</p>
<p>“6. Their style is extremely barbarous, full of solecisms; and in them we often meet with
certain words never used till the later ages. Also, they are all of one style! How does it happen
that so many different Popes, living in divers centuries, should all write in the same manner?”</p>
<p>Dupin then goes on to examine the whole series with learning and candour, showing
that every single one of them “carries with it unequivocal signs of lying and imposture.” To
his pages let the student recur, therefore. I follow him in the following enumeration of the
frauds he calmly exposes with searching logic and demonstration:—</p>
<p>1. St. Clement to St. James the Lord’s Brother.—Plainly spurious.</p>
<note type="footnote">2690 Elucidation II., infra.</note>

<pb n="1728"/>
<p>2. The Second Epistle of Clement to the Same.—Equally so.</p>
<p>3. St. Clement to all Suffragan Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and Others of the Clergy: to all
Princes Great and Small, and to all the Faithful.</p>
<p>Dupin remarks: “This very title suffices to prove the forgery, as, in the days of St.
Clement, there were no “princes great or small” in the Church.” He adds that it speaks of
“subdeacons,” an order not then existing, and that it is patched up from scraps of the apocryphal
Recognitions.</p>
<p>4. A Fourth Letter of the Same. It is self-refuted by “the same reasons.”</p>
<p>5. The Fifth Letter to St. James of St. Clement, Bishop of Rome and Successor of St. Peter.</p>
<p>“But,” says Dupin, “as St. James died before St. Peter, it necessarily follows, that this
epistle cannot have been written by St. Clement.” Further, “We have one genuine epistle
of St. Clement, the style of which is wholly different from that of these Decretals.”</p>
<p>6. The Epistle of Anacletus.—Barbarous, full of solecisms and falsehoods.</p>
<p>7. A Second Epistle of Anacletus.—Filled with passages out of authors who lived long
after the times of Anacletus.</p>
<p>8. A Third Letter, etc..—Spurious for the same reasons.</p>
<p>9. An Epistle of Evaristus.—Patched up out of writings of Innocent in the fifth century,
dated under consuls not contemporaries of the alleged writer.</p>
<p>10. A Second Epistle of the Same.—Stuffed with patchwork of later centuries.</p>
<p>11. An Epistle of Alexander.—Contains passages from at least one author of the eighth
century.</p>
<p>12. A Second Epistle of the Same.—Refers to the Council of Laodicea, which was held
(a.d. 365) after Alexander was dead.</p>
<p>13. A Third Epistle, etc.—Quotes an author of the fifth century.</p>
<p>14. An Epistle of Xystus.—Dated under a consul that lived in another age, and quotes
authors of centuries later than his own day.</p>
<p>15. A Second Epistle of the Same.—Subject to the same objections, anachronisms, etc.</p>
<p>16. An Epistle of Telesphorus.—False dates, patched from subsequent authors, etc.</p>
<p>17. An Epistle of Hyginus.—Anachronisms, etc.</p>
<p>18. A Second of the Same.—Stuffed with anachronisms, and falsely dated by consuls
not of his age.</p>
<p>19. An Epistle of Pius I.—Full of absurdities, and quotes “the Theodosian Code”!</p>
<p>20. A Second.—It is addressed to Justus, etc. Bad Latin, and wholly unknown to antiquity,
though Baronius has tried to sustain it.</p>
<p>21. A Third Letter, etc.—Addressed to Justus, bishop of Vienna. False for the same
reasons.</p>
<p>22. An Epistle of Anicetus.—Full of blunders as to dates, etc. Mentions names, titles,
and the like, unheard of till later ages.</p>

<pb n="1729"/>
<p>23. An Epistle of Soter.—Dated under consuls who lived before Soter was bishop of
Rome.</p>
<p>24. A Second Letter, etc.—Speaks of “monks,” “palls,” and other things of later times;
is patched out of writings of subsequent ages, and dated under consuls not his contemporaries.</p>
<p>25. An Epistle of Eleutherus.—Subject to like objections.</p>
<p>26. A Second Letter, etc.—Anachronisms.</p>
<p>27. A Third Letter, etc.—Addressed to “Desiderius, bishop of Vienna.” There was no
such bishop till the sixth century.</p>
<p>28. A Fourth Letter, etc.—Quotes later authors, and is disproved by its style.</p>
<p>29. An Epistle of Zephyrinus.—Little importance to be attached to anything from such
a source; but Dupin (who lived before his bad character came to light in the writings of
Hippolytus) convicts it of ignorance, and shows that it is a patchwork of later ideas and
writers.</p>
<p>30. A Second Letter.—“Yet more plainly an imposture,” says Dupin.
31. An Epistle of St. Callistus.—What sort of a “saint” he was, our readers are already
informed. This epistle is like the preceding ones of Zephyrinus.</p>
<p>32. A Second Epistle, etc.—Quotes from writings of the eighth century.</p>
<p>33. An Epistle of Urban.—Quotes the Vulgate, the Theodosian Code, and Gregory the
Fourth.</p>
<p>34. An Epistle of Pontianus.—Anachronisms.</p>
<p>35. A Second Epistle, etc.—Barbarous and impossible.</p>
<p>36. An Epistle of Anterus.—Equally impossible; stuffed with anachronisms.</p>
<p>37. An Epistle of Fabianus.—Contradicts the facts of history touching Cyprian, Cornelius,
and Novatus.</p>
<p>38. A Second Epistle, etc.—Self-refuted by its monstrous details of mistake and the like.</p>
<p>39. A Third Epistle, etc.—Quotes authors of the sixth century.</p>
<p>40. An Epistle of Cornelius.—Contradicts historical facts, etc.</p>
<p>41. A Second Epistle, etc.—Equally full of blunders. “But nothing,” says Dupin, “shows
the imposture of these two letters more palpably than the difference of style from those truly
ascribed to Cornelius in Cyprian’s works.”</p>
<p>42. A Third Letter, etc.—Equally false on its face. Dupin, with his usual candour, remarks:
“We find in it the word ‘Mass,’ which was unknown to the contemporaries of Cornelius.”</p>
<p>43. An Epistle of Lucius.—It is dated six months before he became Bishop of Rome, and
quotes authors who lived ages after he was dead.</p>
<p>44. An Epistle of Stephen.—“Filled with citations out of subsequent authors.”</p>

<pb n="1730"/>
<p>45. A Second Epistle, etc.—Open to the like objection; it does not harmonize with the
times to which it is referred.</p>
<p>Here Dupin grows weary, and winds up his review as follows:—</p>
<p>For like reasons, we must pass judgment, in like manner, on the two Epistles of Sixtus
II.; the two of Dionysius; the three of St. Felix I; the two of Eutychianus; one of Caius; two
of Marcellinus and those of Marcellus; the three of Eusebius; those of Miltiades, and the rest
of Isidore’s collection: they are full of passages out of Fathers, Popes, and councils, more
modern than the very Popes by whom they are pretended to be written. In them are many
things that clash with the known history of those times, and were purposely framed to favour
the court of Rome and to sustain her pretensions against the rights of bishops and the liberties
of churches. But it would take up too much time to show the gross falsehood of these
monuments. They are now rejected by common consent, and even by those authors who
are most favourable to the court of Rome, who are obliged to abandon the patronage of
these epistles, though they have done a great deal of service in developing the greatness of
the court of Rome, and ruining the ancient discipline of the Church, especially with reference
to the rights of bishops and ecclesiastical decisions.</p>
<p>The following is the Translator’s Preface to these frauds:—</p>
<p>In regard to these Decretals, Dean Milman says: “Up to this period the Decretals, the
letters or edicts of the Bishops of Rome, according to the authorized or common collection
of Dionysius, commenced with Pope Siricius, towards the close of the fourth century. To
the collection of Dionysius was added that of the authentic councils, which bore the name
of Isidore of Seville. On a sudden was promulgated, unannounced, without preparation,
not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently overawing at once all doubt, a new code, which
to the former authentic documents added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest
popes from Clement to Melchiades,2691 and the donation of Constantine;2692 and in the
third part, among the decrees of the popes and of the councils from Sylvester to Gregory
II., thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts of several unauthentic councils.”2693</p>
<p>In regard to the authorship and date of the False Decretals, Dean Milman says: “The
author or authors of this most audacious and elaborate of pious frauds are unknown; the
date and place of its compilation are driven into such narrow limits that they may be determined
within a few years, and within a very circumscribed region. The False Decretals came
not from Rome; the time of their arrival at Rome, after they were known beyond the Alps,
appears almost certain. In one year Nicholas I. is apparently ignorant of their existence; the

next he speaks of them with full knowledge. They contain words manifestly used at the
Council of Paris, a.d. 829, consequently are of later date. They were known to the Levite
Benedict of Mentz, who composed a supplement to the collection of capitularies by Ansegise,
between a.d. 840–847. The city of Mentz is designated with nearly equal certainty as the
place in which, if not actually composed, they were first promulgated as the canon law of
Christendom.”2694</p>

<head>The First Epistle.</head>

<p>Of the final decision of the trials of bishops, and graver ecclesiastical cases in the seat of the
apostles.</p>
<p>Zephyrinus, archbishop of the city of Rome, to all the bishops settled in Sicily, in the
Lord, greeting.</p>
<p>We ought to be mindful of the grace of God to us, which in His own merciful regard
has raised us for this purpose to the summit of priestly honour, that, abiding by His commandments,
and appointed in a certain supervision of His priests, we may prohibit things
unlawful, and teach those that are to be followed. As night does not extinguish the stars of
heaven, so the unrighteousness of the world does not blind the minds of the faithful that
hold by the sure support of Scripture. Therefore we ought to consider well and attend
carefully to the Scriptures, and the divine precepts which are contained in these Scriptures,
in order that we may show ourselves not transgressors, but fulfillers of the law of God.</p>
<p>Now patriarchs and primates, in investigating the case of an accused bishop, should not
pronounce a final decision until, supported by the authority of the apostles, they find that
the person either confesses himself guilty, or is proved so by witnesses trustworthy and
regularly examined, who should not be fewer in number than were those disciples whom
the Lord directed to be chosen for the help of the apostles—that is, seventy-two. Detractors
also, who are to be rooted out by divine authority, and the advisers of enemies (auctores
inimicorum), we do not admit in the indictment of bishops or in evidence against them; nor
should any one of superior rank be indicted or condemned on the accusations of inferiors.
Nor in a doubtful case should a decisive judgment be pronounced; nor should any trial be
held valid unless it has been conducted according to order. No one, moreover, should be
judged in his absence, because both divine and human laws forbid that. The accusers of
those persons should also be free of all suspicion, because the Lord has chosen that His pillars

201), and that he died in the first year of the reign of Antoninus (Heliogabalus, a.d. 218). He is several times

should stand firm, and not be shaken by any one who will. For a sentence should not bind
any of them if it is not given by their proper judge, because even the laws of the world ordain
that that be done. For any accused bishop may, if it be necessary, choose twelve judges by
whom his case may be justly judged. Nor should he be heard or excommunicated or judged
until these be chosen by him; and on his being regularly summoned at first to a council of
his own bishops, his case should be justly heard by them, and investigated on sound principles.
The end of his case, however, should be remitted to the seat of the apostles, that it
may be finally decided there. Nor should it be finished, as has been decreed of old by the
apostles or their successors, until it is sustained by its authority. To it also all, and especially
the oppressed, should appeal and have recourse as to a mother, that they may be nourished
by her breasts, defended by her authority, and relieved of their oppressions, because “a
mother cannot,” and should not, “forget her son.”2696 For the trials of bishops and graver
ecclesiastical cases, as the apostles and their holy successors have decreed, are to be finally
decided along with other bishops2697 by the seat of the apostles, and by no other; because,
although they may be transferred to other bishops, it was yet to the blessed Apostle Peter
these terms were addressed: “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”2698 And the other
privileges which have been granted to this holy seat alone are found embodied both in the
constitutions of the apostles2699 and their successors, and in very many others in harmony
with these. For the apostles have prefixed seventy2700 decrees, together with very many
other bishops, and have appointed them to be kept. For to judge rashly of the secrets of
another’s heart is sin; and it is unjust to reprove him on suspicion whose works seem not
other than good, since God alone is Judge of those things which are unknown to men. He,
however, “knoweth the secrets of the heart,”2701 and not another. For unjust judgments
are to be guarded against by all, especially however by the servants of God. “And the servant
of the Lord must not strive,”2702 nor harm any one. For bishops are to be borne by laity

<p>On the Spoliation or Expulsion of certain Bishops.</p>
<p>It has been reported at the seat of the apostles by your delegates,2707 that certain of our
brethren, bishops to wit, are being expelled from their churches and seats, and deprived of
their goods, and summoned, thus destitute and spoiled, to trial; a thing which is void of all
reason, since the constitutions of the apostles and their successors, and the statutes of emperors,
and the regulations of laws, prohibit it, and the authority of the seat of the apostles
forbids it to be done. It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that bishops who
have been ejected and spoiled of their property should recover their churches, and, in the
first place, have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any
one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the like risk; that the judges should
be discreet, the bishops right-minded and harmonious in the Church, where they should
be witnesses for every one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer
till all that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law without
detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute you, when they persecuted even to
death your Head, Christ our Lord. Yet even persecutions are to be endured patiently, that
ye may be known to be His disciples, for whom also ye suffer. Whence, too, he says Himself,
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.”2708 Sustained by these
testimonies, we ought not greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their upbraidings,
since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “Hearken
unto me, ye that know righteousness, my people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the
reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings;”2709 considering what is written in
the Psalm, “Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart,2710 and
the thoughts of such men, that they are vanity,”2711 “They spoke vanity every one with his
neighbour: with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil heart they spoke. But the Lord
shall cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things; who have said, Our
lips are our own; who is Lord over us?”2712 For if they kept these things in memory, they

would by no means break forth into so great wickedness. For they do not this by laudable
and paternal instruction (probabili et paterna doctrina), but that they may wreak their
vengeful feeling against the servants of God. For it is written, “The way of a fool is right in
his eyes;”2713 and, “There are ways which seem right unto a man, but the end thereof leads
to death.”2714 Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the judgment of God,
who will render to every man according to his works;2715 who also has thundered through
His servants, saying, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.”2716 Assist ye, therefore, one another
in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the
help of a brother, since “by this,” saith the Lord, “shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye have love one to another.”2717 Whence, too, He speaks by the prophet, saying, “Behold
how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!”2718 In a spiritual
dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in God, and in the unity of the faith which
distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously
illustrated in Aaron and the priests2719 clothed with honour, as ointment upon the head,
nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this
dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the
importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word
for love’s sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not
good to repay detraction with detraction, or according to the common proverb to cast out a
beam with a beam (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours.
May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power is given sometimes
to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the
Spirit of God may become more glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those
very persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe.
Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for injury done to them concerns Him
whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of
enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their
lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the
Lord speaks by the prophet, “I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue.”2720 May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus

<p>2. It is worth while to recall who and what Zephyrinus was. See vol. v. p. 156, Elucidation
V.; also same volume of this series, p. 157, Elucidation VI. This unhappy prelate was a
heretic; and his decrees and opinions are worthless, as Hippolytus shows. Hence this letter,
even were it genuine, would be of no value whatever. Consult also vol. v. p. 156, in Elucidation
IV.; also same volume, Elucidation III.</p>

the wily forger forgot himself, as if the Cæsars of this date had legislated for the Christian
Church. On the spirit of the ancient Canons, refuting all these Decretals, compare the

<p>(Of the seasons for fasting.)</p>
<p>Fasting, which ye have learned to hold three times in the year among us, we decree now
to take place, as more suitable, in four seasons; so that even as the year revolves through
four seasons, we too may keep a solemn fast quarterly in the four seasons of the year. And
as we are replenished with corn, and wine, and oil for the nourishment of our bodies, so let
us be replenished with fasting for the nourishment of our souls, in accordance with the word
of the prophet Zechariah, who says, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,
and I repented not; so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem, and to
the house of Judah: fear ye not. These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man
the truth to his neighbour; judge the truth and the judgment of peace in your gates; and let
none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour, and love no false oath: for
all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord of hosts. And the word of the Lord of hosts
came unto me, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The fast of the fourth month, and the
fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of
the Lord joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; only love the truth and peace, saith the Lord
of hosts.”2725 In this, then, we ought to be all of one mind, so that, according to apostolic
teaching, we may all say the same thing, and that there be no divisions among us. Let us
then be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment;2726 in ready zeal for which
work we congratulate ourselves on having your affection as our partner. For it is not meet
for the members to be at variance with the head; but, according to the testimony of sacred
Scripture,2727 all the members should follow the head. It is matter of doubt, moreover, to
no one, that the church of the apostles is the mother of all the churches, from whose ordinances
it is not right that you should deviate to any extent. And as the Son of God came to
do the Father’s will, so shall ye fulfil the will of your mother, which is the Church, the head
of which, as has been stated already, is the church of Rome. Wherefore, whatsoever may
be done against the discipline of this church, without the decision of justice, cannot on any
account be permitted to be held valid.</p>

<p>(Of accusations against doctors.)</p>
<p>Moreover, let no one take up an accusation against a doctor (teacher), because it is not
right for sons to find fault with fathers, nor for slaves to wound their masters. Now, all those
whom they instruct are sons of doctors; and as sons ought to love their fathers after the
flesh, so ought they to love their spiritual fathers. For he does not live rightly who does not
believe rightly, or who reprehends fathers, or calumniates them. Doctors therefore, who
are also called fathers, are rather to be borne with than reprehended, unless they err from
the true faith. Let no one, consequently, accuse a doctor by writing (per scripta); neither let
him answer to any accuser, unless he be one who is trustworthy and recognised by law, and
who leads also a life and conversation free from reproach. For it is a thing unworthy that
a doctor should reply to a foolish and ignorant person, and one who leads a reprehensible
life, according to the man’s folly; as Scripture says, Answer not a fool according to his
folly.2728 He does not live rightly who does not believe rightly. He means nothing evil who
is faithful. If anyone is faithful (a believer), let him see to it that he make no false allegations,
nor lay a snare for any man. The faithful man acts always in faith; and the unfaithful man
plots cunningly, and strives to work the ruin of those who are faithful, and who live in piety
and righteousness, because like seeks like. The unfaithful man is one dead in the living
body. And on the other hand, the discourse of the man of faith guards the life of his hearers.
For as the Catholic doctor, and especially the priest of the Lord, ought to be involved in no
error, so ought he to be wronged by no machination or passion. Holy Scripture indeed says,
Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites;2729 and we must resist many
allurements of this world, and many vanities, in order that the integrity of a true continence
may be obtained, whereof the first blemish is pride, the beginning of transgression and the
origin of sin; for the mind with lustful will knows neither to abstain nor to give itself to
piety. No good man has an enemy except in the wicked, who are permitted to be such only
in order that the good man may be corrected or exercised through their means. Whatever,
therefore, is faultless is defended by the Church Catholic. Neither for prince, nor for any
one who observes piety, is it lawful to venture anything contrary to the divine injunctions.
Consequently an unjust judgment, or an unjust decision (diffinitio), instituted or enforced
by judges under the fear or by the command of a prince, or any bishop or person of influence,
cannot be valid. The religious man ought not to hold it enough merely to refrain from entering
into the enmities of others, or increasing them by evil speech, unless he also make it
his study to extinguish them by good speech.2730 Better is a humble confession in evil deeds,

than a proud boasting in good deeds.2731 Moreover, all who live the blessed life, choose
rather to run that course in the proper estate of peace and righteousness, than to involve
themselves in the avenging pains of our sins.2732 For I am mindful that I preside over the
Church under the name of him whose confession was honoured by our Lord Jesus Christ,
and whose faith ever destroys all errors. And I understand that I am not at liberty to act
otherwise than to expend all my efforts on that cause in which the well-being of the universal
Church is at stake (infestatur). I hope, too, that the mercy of God will so favour us, that,
with the help of His clemency, every deadly disease may be removed, God Himself expelling
it, and that whatever may be done wholesomely, under His inspiration and help, may be
accomplished to the praise of thy faith and devotion. For all things cannot otherwise be
safe, unless, as far as pertains to the service of the divine office, sacerdotal authority upholds
them. Given on the 21st day of November in the consulship of the most illustrious Antoninus
and Alexander.2733</p>

<p>(Of those who conspire against bishops, or who take part with such.)</p>
<p>Now we have heard that the crime of conspiracies prevails in your parts, and it has been
shown us that the people are conspiring against their bishops; of which crime the craft is
hateful, not only among Christians, but even among the heathen, and it is forbidden by
foreign laws. And therefore the laws not only of the Church, but of the world, condemn
those who are guilty of this crime; and not only those indeed who actually conspire, but
those also who take part with such.2734 Our predecessors, moreover, together with a very
numerous body of bishops, ordained that any guilty of this offence among those who are set
in the honour of the priesthood, and who belong to the clergy, should be deprived of the
honour which they enjoy; and they ordered that others should be cut off from communion,
and expelled from the Church; and they decreed, at the same time, that all men of both orders
should be infamous (infames); and that, too, not only for those who did the deed, but for
those also who took part with such. For it is but equitable that those who despise the divine
mandates, and prove themselves disobedient to the ordinances of the fathers, should be
chastised with severer penalties, in order that others may fear to do such things, and that
all may rejoice in brotherly concord, and all take to themselves the example of severity and
goodness. For if (which may God forbid) we neglect the care of the Church, and are regardless
of its strength, our slothfulness will destroy discipline, and injury will be done assuredly
to the souls of the faithful. Such persons, moreover, are not to be admitted to accuse any
one: neither can their voice, nor that of those who are under the ban, injure or criminate
any man.</p>

wittingly holds intercourse with the excommunicated in these or other prohibited
matters, will subject himself, according to the ordinance of the apostles,2735 to like excommunication.
From these, therefore, let clergy and laity keep themselves if they would not

observe this law, which has been laid down by the apostles2738 and fathers, and our predecessors,
and has been ratified by us: to wit, that if any metropolitan bishop, except in that
which pertains to his own proper parish alone, shall attempt to do anything without the
counsel and good-will of all the comprovincial bishops, he will do it at the risk of his position,
and what he does in this manner shall be held null and void; but whatever it may be necessary
to do or to arrange with regard to the cases of the body of provincial bishops, and the necessities
of their churches and clergy and laity, this should be done by consent of all the pontiffs
of the same province, and that too without any pride of lordship, but with the most humble
and harmonious action, even as the Lord says: “I came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister.”2739 And in another passage He says: “And whosoever of you is the greater, shall
be your servant,”2740 and so forth. And in like manner the bishops of the same province
themselves should do all things in counsel with him, except so much as pertains to their
own proper parishes, in accordance with the statutes of the holy fathers (who, although they
have preceded us by a certain interval of time, have yet drawn the light of truth and faith
from one and the same fountain of purity, and have sought the prosperity of the Church of
God and the common advantage of all Christians by the same enlightening and guiding
Spirit), that with one mind, and one mouth, and one accord, the Holy Trinity may be glorified
for ever. No primate, no metropolitan, nor any of the other bishops, is at liberty to enter
the seat of another, or to occupy a possession which does not pertain to him, and which
forms part of the parish of another bishop, at the direction of any one, unless he is invited
by him to whose jurisdiction it is acknowledged to belong; nor can he set about any arrange-

ment or ordinance, or judgment there, if he wishes to keep the honour of his station. But
if he presume to do otherwise, he shall be condemned; and not only he, but those who cooperate
and agree with him: for just as the power of making appointments (ordinatio) is
interdicted in such circumstances, so also is the power of judging or of disposing of other
matters. For if a man has no power to appoint, how shall he judge? Without doubt, he shall
in no wise judge or have power to judge: for just as another man’s wife cannot intermarry
with anyone (adulterari), nor be judged or disposed of by any one but by her own husband
so long as he liveth; so neither can it in anywise be allowed that the wife of a bishop, by
whom undoubtedly is meant his church or parish, should be judged or disposed of by another
without his (the bishop’s) judgment and good-will so long as he liveth, or enjoy another’s
embrace, that is, his ordaining. Wherefore the apostle says: “The wife is bound by the
law so long as her husband liveth; but if he be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.”
2741 In like manner also, the spouse of a bishop (for the church is called his spouse
and wife) is bound to him while he liveth; but when he is dead she is loosed, and may be
wedded to whomsoever she will, only in the Lord, that is, according to order. For if, while
he is alive, she marry another, she shall be judged to be an adulteress. And in the same
manner, he too, if he marry another of his own will, shall be held to be an adulterer, and
shall be deprived of the privilege of communion. If, however, he is persecuted in his own
church, he must flee to another, and attach himself to it, as the Lord says: “If they persecute
you in one city, flee ye into another.”2742 If, however, the change be made for the sake of
the good of the church, he may not do this of himself, but only on the invitation of the
brethren, and with the sanction of this holy seat, and not for ambition’s sake, but for the
public good.</p>

<p>(Of marriages among blood-relations, and of those who are born of them; and of accusations
which the laws reject.)</p>
<p>Moreover, marriages among blood-relations are forbidden, since all laws, both sacred
and secular, forbid such. Wherefore the divine laws not only expel, but even anathematize,
those who do so, and those who spring from them. Secular laws, again, call such persons
infamous, and interdict them from inheriting. And we too, following our fathers, and
keeping close by their footsteps, brand such with infamy, and hold them to be infamous,
because they are sprinkled with the stains of infamy. Neither ought we to admit those men
or their accusations, that secular laws reject. (For who doubts that human laws, when they
are not inconsistent with reason and honour, are to be embraced, especially when they either
further the public good or defend the authority of the ecclesiastical office, and uphold it as
a help?) And we call those blood-relations whom divine laws, and those of the emperors,
both Roman and Greek, name blood-relations, and whom they admit to the right of inheriting,
and cannot exclude from that. Marriages, then, between such are neither lawful nor
capable of holding good, but are to be rejected. (And if any such are attempted in rash
daring, they come to be rescinded by apostolic authority.)</p>

<p>(Of those who ought not to be admitted to prefer an accusation, or to bear witness; and
that evidence is not to be given but on things happening in the person’s presence.)</p>
<p>Whosoever, therefore, has not been lawfully married, or has been united without the
dotal title (dotali titulo) and the blessing of a priest, cannot by any means bring a charge
against priests, or those who are lawfully married, or bear witness against them, since every
one who is polluted with the stain of incest is infamous, and is not allowed to accuse the
above-named. And consequently not only they, but all those too who agree with them, are
to be rejected, and are rendered infamous. We hold that the same should also be the case
with robbers, or with those who assault the elderly. The laws of the world, indeed, put such
persons to death; but we, with whom mercy has the first place, receive them under the mark
of infamy to repentance. That infamy also with which they are stained, we are not able to
remove; but our desire is to heal their souls by public penitence, and by satisfaction made
to the Church: for public sins are not to be purged by secret correction. Those, again, who
are suspected in the matter of the right faith, should by no means be admitted to prefer
charges against priests, and against those of whose faith there is no doubt; and such persons
should be held of doubtful authority in matters of human testimony. Their voice, consequently,
should be reckoned invalid whose faith is doubted; and no credit should be given
to those who are ignorant of the right faith. Accordingly, in judgment, inquiry should be
made as to the conversation and faith of the person who accuses, and of him who is accused;
since those who are not of correct conversation and faith, and whose life is open to impeachment,
are not allowed to accuse their elders, neither can such permission be given to those
whose faith and life and liberty are unknown. Nor should vile persons be admitted to accuse
them. But a clear examination is to be made as to what kind of persons the accusers are
(rimandæ sunt enucleatim personæ accusatorum); for they are not to be admitted readily
without writing, and are never to be admitted as accusers on mere writing. For no one may
either accuse or be accused by mere writing, but with the living voice; and every one must
lay his accusation in the presence of him whom he seeks to accuse. And no credit should
be given to any accuser in the absence of him whom he seeks to accuse. In like manner,
witnesses must not prefer their evidence by writing only; but they must give their testimony
truthfully in their own persons, and in matters which they have seen and do know. And
they are not to give evidence in any other cases or matters but in those which are known to
have happened in their presence. Accusers, moreover, of one blood, are not to bear witness
against those who are not related to the family, nor is that to be the case with domestics
(familiares) or those proceeding from the house; but if it is their wish, and they agree among
themselves, the parents only should give evidence in such cases, and not others. Neither
accusers nor witnesses should be admitted who are open to any suspicion; for the feeling of

relationship, or friendship, or lordship, is wont to impede the truth. Carnal love, and fear,
and avarice, commonly blunt the perceptions of men, and pervert their opinions; so that
they look on gain as godliness, and on money as the reward of prudence. Let no one, then,
speak deceitfully to his neighbour.2743 The mouth of the malevolent is a deep pit. The innocent
man, while he believes easily, falls readily; but though he falls, he rises; and the
shuffler, with all his arts, goes headlong to ruin, whence he can never rise or escape.
Therefore let every one weigh well his words, and let him not say to another what he would
not say to himself. Whence the sacred Scripture says well: “Do not that to another which
thou wouldest not have done to thyself.”2744 For we need time to do anything perfectly
(maturius); and let us not be precipitate in our counsels or our works, neither let us violate
order. But if any one has fallen in anything, let us not consign him to ruin; but let us reprove
him with brotherly affection, as the blessed apostle says: “If a man be overtaken in any fault,
ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest
thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another’s burden, and so will ye fulfil the law of
Christ.”2745 Furthermore, the sainted David had deadly crimes to repent of, and yet he was
continued in honour. The blessed Peter also shed the bitterest tears when he repented of
having denied the Lord; but still he abode an apostle. And the Lord by the prophet makes
this promise to the sinning: “In the day that the sinner is converted, and repenteth, I will
not mention any more against him all his transgressions.”2746</p>

<p>(As to whether a priest may minister after a lapse.)</p>
<p>For those are in error who think that the priests of the Lord, after a lapse, although they
may have exhibited true repentance, are not capable of ministering to the Lord, and engaging
their honourable offices, though they may lead a good life thereafter, and keep their priesthood
correctly. And those who hold this opinion are not only in error, but also seem to
dispute and act in opposition to the power of the keys committed to the Church, whereof it
is said: “Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.”2747 And in short,
this opinion either is not the Lord’s, or it is true. But be that as it may, we believe without
hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord and other believers may return to their honours
after a proper satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His prophet: “Shall
he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who turns away not return?”2748 And in another
passage the Lord says: “I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and
live.”2749 And the prophet David, on his repentance, said: “Restore unto me the joy of Thy
salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit.”2750 And he indeed, after his repentance,
taught others also, and offered sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers
of the holy Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance
to God, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: “I will teach
transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.”2751 And he offered
sacrifice for himself, while he said: “The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.”2752 For the
prophet, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as to healing
those of others by preaching, and by making offering to God. Thus the shedding of tears
moves the mind’s feeling (passionem). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind
is turned aside from anger. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself,
who does not forgive his neighbour? If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for
with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.2753 In the Lord’s hand
there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (virtutum) and the King
of glory.2754 For the apostle says: “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom
God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness
for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, ‘I say,’ at
this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
in Jesus.”2755 And David says: “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sins are covered.”2756 Man, therefore, is cleansed of his sin, and rises again by the grace of
God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities.
Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide
in him: “Go, and sin no more.”2757 Whence the apostle says: “Let not sin therefore reign
in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: neither yield ye your members
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For
sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What
then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know
ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked,
that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine
which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
I speak after the manner of men.”2758 For greater is the sin of him who judgeth,
than of him who is judged. “Thinkest thou,” says the apostle, “O man, that judgest them
that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? or
despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering? Dost thou
not know that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But, after thy hardness and
impenitent heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds:
to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality,
eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every
man that worketh good.”2759 My brethren, shun not only the holding, but even the hearing,
of the judgment that bans mercy; for better is mercy than all whole burnt-offerings and
sacrifices.2760 We have replied to your interrogations shortly, because your letter found us

for the bishops; and as to the fact that no one should have intercourse with those whom
the bishops excommunicate, and that no one should receive those whom they have cast
out in any manner whatever.2763</p>
<p>Urban, bishop, to all Christians, in sanctification of the spirit, in obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, greeting.</p>
<p>It becomes all Christians, most dearly beloved, to imitate Him whose name they have
received. “What doth it profit, my brethren,” says the Apostle James, “though a man say
he hath faith, and have not works?”2764 “My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that
ye receive (sumitis) the greater condemnation; for in many things we offend all.”2765 “Let

<p>Of the life in common, and of the reason why the Church has begun to hold property.</p>
<p>We know that you are not ignorant of the fact that hitherto the principle of living with
all things in common has been in vigorous operation among good Christians, and is still so
by the grace of God; and most of all among those who have been chosen to the lot of the
Lord, that is to say, the clergy, even as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: “And the multitude
of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought
of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with
great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ: and great grace
was upon them all. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
and laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according
as he had need. And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is,
being interpreted, the son of consolation), a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, having
land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet;”2767 and so forth. Accordingly,
as the chief priests and others, and the Levites, and the rest of the faithful, perceived
that it might be of more advantage if they handed over to the churches over which the
bishops presided the heritages and fields which they were in the way of selling, inasmuch
as they might furnish a larger and better maintenance for the faithful who hold the common
faith, not only in present but also in future times, out of the revenues of such property than
out of the money for which they might at once be sold, they began to consign to the mother
churches the property and lands which they were wont to sell, and got into the manner of
living on the revenues of these.</p>

<p>Of the persons by whom, and the uses for which, ecclesiastical property should be managed,
and of the invaders thereof.</p>
<p>The property, moreover, in the possession of the several parishes was left in the hands
of the bishops, who hold the place of the apostles; and it is so to this day, and ought to be
so in all future time. And out of those possessions the bishops and the faithful as their
stewards ought to furnish to all who wish to enter the life in common all necessaries as they
best can, so that none may be found in want among them. For the possessions of the faithful
are also called oblations, because they are offered to the Lord. They ought not therefore to
be turned to any other uses than those of the Church, and in behoof of Christian brethren
before mentioned, and of the poor; for they are the offerings of the faithful, and they are
redemption moneys for sins (pretia peccatorum), and the patrimony of the poor, and are
given over to the Lord for the purpose already named. But if any one act otherwise (which
may God forbid), let him take care lest he meet the condemnation of Ananias and Sapphira,
and be found guilty of sacrilege, as those were who lied as to the price of the property designated,
of whom we read thus in the before-cited passage of the Acts of the Apostles: “But
a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold land (agrum), and kept back
part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the
apostles’ feet. But Peter said to Ananias, Why hath Satan tempted (tentavit) thine heart to
lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whilst it remained,
was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou
conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto the Lord. And
Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And great fear came on all
them that heard these things. And the young men arose, and removed him (amoverunt),
and carried him out, and buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when
his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, and said, Tell
me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said
unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold,
the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost. And the young men
came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. And great
fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things.”2768 These things,
brethren, are carefully to be guarded against, and greatly to be feared. For the property of
the Church, not being like personal, but like common property, and property offered to the
Lord, is to be dispensed with the deepest fear, in the spirit of faithfulness, and for no other
<note type="footnote">2768 Acts v. 1–11.</note>

<pb n="1760"/>
objects than the above-named, lest those should incur the guilt of sacrilege who divert it
from the hands to which it was consigned, and lest they should come under the punishment
and death of Ananias and Sapphira, and lest (which is yet worse) they should become anathema
maranatha, and lest, though their body may not fall dead like that of Ananias and
Sapphira, their soul, which is nobler than the body, should fall dead, and be cut off from
the company of the faithful, and sink into the depths of the pit. Wherefore all must give
heed to this matter, and watch in faithfulness, and avert the dishonour of such usurpation,
lest possessions dedicated to the uses of things secret (or sacred) and heavenly be spoiled
by any parties invading them. And if any one do so, then, after the sharp vengeance which
is due to such a crime, and which is justly to be carried out against the sacrilegious, let him
be condemned to perpetual infamy, and cast into prison or consigned to life-long exile.
For, according to the apostle,2769 we ought to deliver such a man to Satan, that the spirit
may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>

<p>As to any one’s attempting to take from the Church the right of holding property.</p>
<p>By the increase, therefore, and the mode of life which have been mentioned, the churches
over which the bishops preside have grown so greatly with the help of the Lord, and the
greater part of them are now in possession of so much property, that among them there is
not a man who, selecting the life in common, is kept in poverty; but such an one receives
all necessaries from the bishop and his ministers. Therefore, if any one in modern or in

<p>Furthermore, as to the fact that in the churches of the bishops there are found elevated
seats set up and prepared like a throne, they show by these that the power of inspection and
of judging, and the authority to loose and bind, are given to them by the Lord. Whence the
Saviour Himself says in the Gospel, “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”2770 And elsewhere:
“Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, are remitted unto them;
and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.”2771</p>

as your own souls; and in order that ye may have no communication with those with whom

<p>And in exhorting you, we also admonish all who have embraced the faith of Christ, and
who have taken from Christ the name of Christian, that ye make your Christianity vain in
no respect, but keep stedfastly the engagement which ye took upon yourselves in baptism,
so that ye may be found not reprobate, but worthy in His presence. And if any one of you
has entered the life which has all things common, and has taken the vow to hold no private
property, let him see to it that he make not his promise vain, but let him keep with all
faithfulness this engagement which he has made to the Lord, so that he may acquire for
himself not damnation, but a reward; for it is better for a man not to take a vow at all than
not to discharge to the best of his ability the vow that he has made. For they who have made
a vow, or taken on them the faith, and have not kept their vow, or have carried out their life
in things evil, are punished more severely than those who have carried out their life without
a vow, or have died without faith, but not without doing good works. For to this end have
we received a reasonable mind by the gift of nature, and the renewal also of the second birth,
that, according to the apostle, we may discern (sapiamus) rather things above, and not things
on the earth;2772 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.2773 For to what,
most dearly beloved, does the wisdom of this world urge us, but to seek things that are
hurtful, and to love things that are to perish, and to neglect things that are healthful, and to
esteem as of no value things that are lasting? It commends the love of money, of which it
is said, The love of money is the root of all evil;2774 and which has this evil in especial, that
while it obtrudes the transitory, it hides from view the eternal; and while it looks on things
that are outside, it does not look in upon things that lurk within; and while it seeks after
strange things, it is an evil that makes itself strange to him who does it.2775 Behold, to what
does the wisdom of this world urge a man? To live in pleasures. Whence it is said: A widow
that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she liveth.2776 It urges a man to feed the flesh with the
softest delights, with sins, and vices, and flames, to press the soul with intemperance in food
and wine, and to check the life of the spirit, and to put into his enemy’s hand the sword to
be used against himself. Behold, what is the counsel which the wisdom of this world gives?
That those who are good should choose rather to be evil, and that in error of mind they

<p>Of the imposition of the bishop’s hand.</p>
<p>For all the faithful ought to receive the Holy Spirit after baptism by imposition of the
hand of the bishops, so that they may be found to be Christians fully; because when the Holy
Spirit is shed upon them, the believing heart is enlarged for prudence and stedfastness. We
receive of the Holy Spirit in order that we may be made spiritual; for the natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God.2778 We receive of the Holy Spirit in order that we
may be wise to discern between good and evil, to love the just, and to loathe the unjust, so
as to withstand malice and pride, and resist luxury and divers allurements, and impure and
unworthy lust. We receive of the Holy Spirit in order that, fired with the love of life and
the ardour of glory, we may be able to raise our mind from things earthly to things heavenly
and divine.—Given on the Nones of September,—that is, on the fifth day of the same month,

<head>The First Epistle.2780</head>
<head>To Felix Subscribonius.</head>
<p>On the honour to be bestowed on priests.</p>
<p>Pontianus, bishop, to Felix Subscribonius, greeting.</p>
<p>Our heart is exceedingly rejoiced with your goodness, in that you strive by all means in
your power to carry out the practice of holy religion, and strengthen sad and destitute
brethren in faith and religion. Wherefore we implore the mercy of our Redeemer, that His
grace may support us in all things, and that He may grant us to carry out in effect what He
has given us to aspire after. In this good thing, therefore, the benefits of recompense are
multiplied just in proportion as our zeal for the work increases. And because in all these
things we need the assistance of divine grace, we implore with constant prayers the clemency
of Omnipotent God, that He may both grant us the desire for these good works which should
ever be wrought by us, and give us power also to perform them, and direct us in that way,
for the fruit of well-doing—which way the Pastor of pastors declared Himself to be—so that
ye may be able to carry out through Him, without whom nothing can be done, those good
works which you have begun. Moreover, with respect to the priests of the Lord whom we
have heard you aid against the plots of wicked men, and whose cause you sustain, know ye
that in so doing ye please God greatly, who has called them to the service of Himself, and
has honoured them with so intimate a fellowship with Him, that through them He accepts
the oblations of others, and pardons their sins, and reconciles them with Him. They also
make the body of the Lord with their own mouth (proprio ore corpus Domini conficiunt),
and give it to the people. For of them it is said: He that hurteth you, hurteth me; and he
that doeth you an injury, shall receive again that which he hath done unrighteously.2781
And elsewhere: He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me;
and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me.2782 Hence they are not to be molested,
but honoured. And in them the Lord Himself is honoured, whose commission they execute.
<note type="footnote">2779 Eusebius tells us that Pontianus was bishop of the Roman church five or six years (230–235 a.d.). He

They accordingly, if they happen to fall, are to be raised up and sustained by the faithful.
And again, they are not to be accused by the infamous, or the wicked, or the hostile, or by
the members of another sect or religion. If they sin, they are to be arraigned by the other
priests; further, they are to be held in check (constringantur) by the chief pontiffs, and they
are not to be arraigned or restrained by seculars or by men of evil life. Not slight, therefore,
is our grief in hearing that you have to sorrow for your brother’s passing away (transitu).
For which reason we beseech Almighty God to console you by the breathing (aspiratione)
of His grace, and keep you with heavenly guardianship from evil spirits and perverse men.
For if ye have to bear any turmoil of certain adversaries after his disease, do not think it
strange though ye, who seek to enjoy good in your own country—that is, in the land of the
living—have to bear evil things at the hands of men in a strange country. For the present
life is a sojourning; and to him who sighs after the true fatherland, the place of his sojourning
is a trial, however pleasant it may seem. And as to you who seek the fatherland, among the
sighs which ye heave I hear the groans also of human oppression rising. And this happens
by the wonderful dispensation of Almighty God, in order that, while the truth calls you in
love, this present world may cast back your affection from itself through the tribulations
which it brings on, and that the mind may be so much the more easily delivered from the
love of this world, as it is also impelled while it is called. Therefore, as you have begun, give
heed to the duty of hospitality; labour most urgently in prayer and tears; devote yourselves
more liberally and freely now to those almsgivings which you have ever loved, in order that
in the recompense the profit to you for your work may be greater in proportion as your zeal
for the labour has risen to higher degrees here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hailing your goodness with paternal pleasantness, we beg you not to fail
in the good works which ye have begun. And may no one be able to turn you from them;
but may the clergy and servants of God, and all Christians who sojourn in those parts, fully
discover by the love of Christ and Saint Peter the disposition of your charity in all things,
and obtain the comforts of your favour in every necessity that may arise; to the end that all
may be defended and helped by your aid, and that we, too, may owe you thanks, and that
our Lord Jesus Christ may make good to you eternal glory, and that the blessed Apostle
Peter, the chief of the apostles, in whose cause you spend yourselves, may open the gate of
that same glory.—Given on the 10th day before the kalends of February (the 23d of January),

<head>The Second Epistle.</head>
<head>To All Bishops.</head>
<p>On brotherly love, and on avoiding the evil.</p>
<p>Pontianus, bishop of the holy and universal Church, to all who worship the Lord aright,
and love the divine worship, greeting.</p>
<p>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.2784 These words,
most beloved, are not the words of men, but of angels; and they were not devised by human
sense, but were uttered by angels at the birth of the Saviour. And from these words it can
be understood without doubt by all that peace is given by the Lord, not to men of evil will,
but to men of good will. Whence the Lord, speaking by the prophet, says: “How good is
God to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart! But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
my steps had well-nigh slipped: for I was envious at the unrighteous, when I saw the
prosperity of the wicked.”2785 Of the good, however, the Truth says in His own person,
“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”2786 And they are not the pure in
heart who think evil things, or things hurtful to their brethren; for he who is the faithful
man devises nothing evil. The faithful man, accordingly, loves rather to hear things which
are becoming, than to speak things which are not becoming. And if any one is faithful, let
him see to it that he speak no evil, and lay no snares in the way of any one. In this, then,
are the children of God distinguished from the children of the devil. For the children of
God always think and strive to do things which are of God, and give help unceasingly to
their brethren, and wish to injure no one. But, on the other hand, the children of the devil
are always meditating things evil and hurtful, because their deeds are evil. And of them the
Lord, speaking by the prophet Jeremiah, says: “I will utter my judgments against them
touching all their wickedness.”2787 “Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord;
and with your children’s children will I plead.”2788 “Behold, I frame evil against you, and
devise a device against you.”2789 These things, brethren, are greatly to be feared, and to be
guarded against by all; for the man on whom the judgment of God may fall will not depart
unhurt. And therefore let every one see to it carefully that he neither contrive nor do against
a brother what he would not wish to have to endure himself. And let not the man of faith

come under the suspicion even of saying or doing what he would not wish to have to endure
himself. Wherefore persons suspected, or hostile or litigious, and those who are not of good
conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, and those who do not hold and teach the right
faith, have been debarred from being either accusers or witnesses by our predecessors with
apostolic authority; and we too remove them from that function, and exclude them from it
in times to come, lest those lapse wilfully whom we ought to keep in and save; lest not only
(which may God forbid!) the predicted judgment of God should fall upon both, but we also
should perish (which may God forbid!) through their fault. For it is written, “Have they
made thee the master of a feast? Take care for them, that thou mayst be merry on their ac-
count, and receive as thy crown the ornament of esteem, and find approbation of thine
election.”2790 For the evil word affects the heart, out of which proceed these four objects,
good and evil, life and death; and the tongue in its assiduous action is what determines
these. Wherefore the before-named parties are altogether to be avoided; and until the beforenoted
matters are investigated, and the parties are found to be clear of such, they are not to
be received: for the right sacrifice is to give heed to the commandments, and to depart from
all iniquity. “To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord, and to forsake unrighteousness
is a sacrifice of praise.”2791 For it is written, “Love thy friend, and be faithful
unto him. But if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man who
destroyeth his friend, so is he who destroys (loseth) the friendship of his neighbour. And
as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so art thou that has let thy neighbour go and
shalt not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he has escaped like
a roe out of the snare, because his soul is wounded. Thou wilt not be able to bind him any
more, and there is reconciliation for the reviled. But to betray the secrets of a friend is the
desperation of a wretched soul. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and no one will
cast him off. When thou art present, he will despise his own mouth, and express his wonder
at thy discourse; but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have
hated many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone
on high, it will fall upon his own head, and a deceitful stroke of the deceitful will make
wounds. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that setteth a stone in his neighbour’s
way will fall thereon; and he that placeth a snare for another will perish therein. He that
worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh on him.
Mockery and reproach are from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall be in wait for
them. They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall perish in the snare, and anguish
shall consume them before they die. Anger and wrath are both abominations, and the sinful
man shall have them both.”2792 “He that will be avenged shall find vengeance from the

Lord, and he will surely keep his sins. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done
unto thee, and then shall thy sins be forgiven thee when thou prayest. One man beareth
hatred against another; and doth he ask redress of God? He showeth no mercy to a man
which is like himself; and doth he ask forgiveness of the Most High for his own sins? He,
though he is flesh, nourisheth hatred; and doth he ask pardon of God? Who will entreat
for his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; for corruption and death impend on
commandments. Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy neighbour. Remember
the covenant of the Highest, and look down upon (despice) the ignorance of thy neighbour.
Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins.</p>
<p>For a furious man kindleth strife; and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and make
enmity among them that be at peace. For even as the trees of the wood are, so will the fire
burn; and as a man’s strength is, so will his anger be; and as his riches are, so will he make
his anger rise. An hastened contention will kindle a fire, and an hastening quarrel will shed
blood, and a testifying (testificans) tongue will bring death. If thou blow upon the spark, it
will burn like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it will be extinguished: and both these come
out of the mouth. Cursed be the whisperer and doubled-tongued, for such have troubled
many that were at peace. A third (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them
from nation to nation: the fortified cities of the rich it hath pulled down, and overthrown
the houses of great men. It has subverted the virtues of peoples, and has destroyed strong
nations. A third tongue hath cast out truthful2793 women, and deprived them of their labours.
Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly. The stroke
of the whip maketh marks in the flesh, but the stroke of the tongue will break bones. Many
have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not in such manner as those who have perished by
their tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, who hath not passed into the
anger thereof, and who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound with the
bands of it; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the band thereof is a band of brass.
The death thereof is the vilest death, and the grave were better than it. The perseverance
thereof shall not abide; but it shall hold the ways of the unrighteous, and its flame shall not
burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and
not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and hurt them as a leopard. Hedge
thine ears about with thorns, and listen not to the evil tongue; and make a door for thy
mouth, and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and silver, and make a balance for
thy words, and right curbs for thy mouth. And beware that thou slide not perchance in thy
tongue, and fall before thine enemies that lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be irremediable

even to death.”2794 “Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day.
For suddenly shall His wrath come, and in the time of vengeance He will destroy thee. Set
not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit thee in the day of veiling
(for execution, obductionis) and vengeance. Move not with every wind, and go not into
every way; for so is the sinner proved with the double-tongue. Be stedfast in the way of the
Lord, and in the truth of thine understanding, and in knowledge; and let the word of peace
and righteousness attend thee. Be courteous in hearing the word, that thou mayest understand
it, and with wisdom give a true answer. If thou hast understanding, answer thy
neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, lest thou be caught in a word of folly, and
be confounded. Honour and glory are in the talk of the intelligent man; the tongue of the
unwise is his fall. Be not called a whisperer, and be not caught in thy tongue, and confounded.
For confusion and penitence are upon the thief, and the worst condemnation upon
the double-tongued. Moreover, for the whisperer there is hatred, and enmity, and shame.
Justify the small and the great alike.”2795 Instead of a friend, become not an enemy to thy
neighbour. For the evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, and every sinner in like
manner that is envious and double-tongued. Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own
heart as a bull, lest perchance thy virtue be shattered in folly, and it consume thy leaves, and
destroy thy fruits, and thou be left as a dry tree in the desert. For a wicked soul shall destroy
him that hath it, and makes him to be laughed to scorn by his enemies, and shall bring him
down to the lot of the impious.”2796 Most dearly beloved, study to lift up the oppressed,
and always help the necessitous; for if a man relieves an afflicted brother, delivers a captive,
or consoles a mourner, let him have no doubt that that will be recompensed to him by Him
on whom he bestows it all, and who says: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”2797 Strive, then, unceasingly to do what is good
in such wise that ye may both obtain the fruit of good works here, and enjoy the favour of
God in the future, to the intent that hereafter ye may be worthy to enter the court of the
heavenly kingdom.—Given on the fourth day before the kalends of May (the 28th of April),

<head>Pope Anterus.2798</head>
<head>The Epistle.</head>
<p>On the translation of bishops and of episcopal seats.</p>
<p>To the brethren, most dearly beloved, constituted to be bishops in the provinces of
Boetica and Toletana, Bishop Anterus sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>I should wish, my dearest brethren, always to receive the glad account of your sincere
love and peace, so that the signs of your welfare might be promoted in turn by the dissemination
of our letters among you, if our ancient enemy should give us quiet and deliverance
from his attacks; who was a liar from the beginning,2799 the enemy of the truth, the rival of
man—in order to deceive whom he first deceived himself,—the adversary of modesty, the
master of luxury. He feeds on cruelties; he is punished by abstinence; he hates fasts, and
his ministers preach, to that effect, as he declares them to be superfluous, having no hope
of the future, and echoing that sentence of the apostle, in which he says, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we shall die.”2800 O miserable boldness! O subtlety of a desperate
mind! For he exhorts to hatred, and puts concord to flight. And because the mind of man
is easily drawn over to the worse part, and chooses rather to walk by the broad way than
laboriously to take its course by the narrow way, for this reason, brethren most dearly beloved,
follow ye the better, and always leave the worse behind you. Do good, avoid evil, in order
that ye may be found to be the disciples of the Lord in truth.</p>
<p>Now, of the transference of bishops, on which subject it has been your wish to consult
the holy seat of the apostles, know ye that that may lawfully be done for the sake of the
common good, or when it is absolutely necessary, but not at the mere will or bidding of any
individual. Peter, our holy master, and the prince of the apostles, was translated for the sake
of the common good from Antioch to Rome, in order that he might be in a position there
of doing more service. Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor city to Alexandria
by apostolic authority. In like manner Felix, on account of the doctrine and the good life
which he maintained, was translated by the common consent of the bishops and the other
priests, and the people from the city in which, on the election of the citizens, he had been
ordained, to Ephesus. For that man is not chargeable with shifting from city to city who
<note type="footnote">2798 Anterus succeeded Pontianus in the bishopric of the Roman church (232–236 a.d.). The letter ascribed
to him is one of the pseudo-Isidorian forgeries.</note>

<note type="footnote">2800 1 Cor. xv. 32.</note>

<pb n="1775"/>
does not do that of his own inclination or by the force of ambition, but who is transferred
for the general good, or in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the consent of
the chief parties. Nor can he be said to transfer himself from a smaller city to a larger, who
is placed in that position not by his own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being
driven out of his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some necessity, and
who without pride and in humility has been translated and installed there by others for the
good of the place or the people: for man looketh on the countenance, but the Lord seeth
the heart. And the Lord, speaking by the prophet, says, “The Lord knows the thoughts of
men, that they are vanity.”2801 That man, therefore, does not change his seat who does not
change his mind. Nor does he change his city who is changed not of his own will, but by
the decision and election of others. And accordingly he does not shift from city to city who
does not leave his own city for the sake of gain to himself, or of his own choice, but who, as
has already been said, has been translated to another city either in consequence of being
driven out of his own seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue of the election and
injunction of the priests and people. For as the bishops have power regularly to ordain
bishops and other orders of priests, so, as often as any matter of advantage or necessity
constrains them, they have power in the above-mentioned manner both to transfer and to
install. As ye have asked our opinion in these matters, though they are not subjects unknown
to you, we give you these things in charge to hold them, lest, through the ignorance of some,
that which is better and more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be taken
up, even as we read in the holy Gospel: “Woe unto you, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint,
and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy,
and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides,
which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.”2802 What is lawful is with them not lawful,
and what is not lawful is lawful. Even as Jannes and Mambres2803 resisted the truth, so do
they, being reprobate in mind, and lovers of pleasure rather than of God, teach that that is
unlawful which is lawful, to wit, that bishops should shift from city to city in the manner
already noted; and what is unlawful they teach as lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to
those who endure straits: that is to say, they deny that a bishop belonging to another city
should be bestowed for good, or for necessity’s sake, upon those who have no bishop, and
who want the sacred episcopal ministry; and that another episcopal seat should be assigned
to bishops who endure persecution or straits. They contradict the sacred Scripture also,
which testifies that God desireth mercy rather than judgment.2804</p>

<p>What greater charity, I pray you, can there be, or what more profitable service of piety,
on the part of any one to another, than to deliver him from the darkness of ignorance and
the thick darkness of inexperience, and restore him, in fine, by the nutriment of the doctrine
of the true faith, not for gain indeed, or ambition, but for instruction and edification? [For
he becomes, so to speak, the hand for the maimed, the foot for the lame, the eye for the
blind,2805 who unlocks the treasure of wisdom and knowledge to one wrapped in the darkness
of ignorance, and opens up to such an one the brightness of the light and the ways of the
Lord.]2806</p>
<p>Now for both parties—namely, for those who endure a famine of the word of God, and
for bishops who endure straits, when they are installed in other cities for the common
good—no small degree of mercy is shown. And they who deny this, although they have the
form of godliness, do yet deny the power thereof.2807 For in such a matter I make no recognition
of race (prosapiam). If, however, any one of the wise, whom the stress of this storm
(or season) has allied with other leaders among the unwise, is stained with a participation
in their deeds, yet the excellence of the wise man, although he may chance to be privy to
their offences, makes him incapable of giving himself as a leader to sinners. The cause of
public good and necessity is one thing, and the cause of self-seeking, and presumption, or
private inclination, is another thing. On account of self-seeking, or presumption, or private
inclination, bishops are not to be transferred from one city to another, but only on account
of public good and necessity. And this is a matter which no one denies, except those of
whom it is said, “They have erred through wine; they have not known the seer; they have
been ignorant of judgment.”2808 For if I were constrained to open up in narration things
that have been brought to end, I would show you that no comfort comes from the comparison
of such deeds. But, most dearly beloved, “stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the
old paths of the Lord, and see what is the good way and the right, and walk therein, and ye
shall find rest for your souls.”2809 And, to speak according to the word of Wisdom: “Love
righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and in simplicity
of heart seek Him. For He is found of them that tempt Him not, and showeth Himself unto
such as do not distrust Him. For froward thoughts separate from God; and His power,
when it is tried, reproveth the unwise. For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter,
nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit,
and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unright-

eousness cometh in. For wisdom is a benign spirit, and will not acquit a blasphemer of His
words. For God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his
tongue. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the world, and that which containeth all things
hath knowledge of the voice. Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid;
neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him. For inquisition shall be made into
the counsels of the ungodly. And the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord, and
unto the manifestation of his wicked deeds; for the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and
the noise of murmurings shall not be hid. Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable;
and refrain your tongue from backbiting, for there is no word so secret that it shall
go for nought. The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul. Seek not death in the error of your
life, and pull not upon yourself destruction with the works of your hands; for God made
not death, neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living. For He created all things
that they might have their being, and He wished the nations of the world to be healthful.
There is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth of the
living. Righteousness is perpetual and immortal, but unrighteousness is the acquisition of
death. And ungodly men with their hands and words called it to them; and when they
thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it; because
they are worthy of death who take part with it.”2810 “For they said, reasoning with
themselves, but not aright, The time of our life is short and tedious; and in the death of a
man there is no remedy, neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.
For we are born of nothing, and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been. For the
breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and speech is a little spark for the moving of our heart;
which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish
as the soft air. And our life shall pass as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist
that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. And
our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance.
For our time is a very shadow that passeth away, and after our end there is no returning;
for it is fast sealed, and no man shall come again.”2811 And for this reason every one must
see to it that he keep himself with all care, and watch himself for his own good, so that when
his last day and the end of his life come upon him, he may not pass over to everlasting death,
but to eternal life. For the deeds of those put under us are judged by us, but our own doth
God judge. Sometimes, moreover, bishops are perverted through the fault of the people, to
the end that those fall more precipitately who follow them. When the head languisheth, the
other members of the body are affected thereby. And viler are those who corrupt the life
and morals of the good, than those who spoil the property and goods of others. Let each

one take care that he have neither an itching tongue nor itching ears; that is to say, that he
neither be a detractor of others himself, nor listen to others in their detractions. “Thou
sattest,” saith he, “and spakest against thy brother; and thou didst slander thine own mother’s
son.”2812 Let every individual abstain from a detracting tongue, and keep a guard upon his
own words, and understand that all that they say of others shall enter into the judgment
wherewith they themselves shall be judged. No one readily refers to an unwilling auditor.
Let it be the care of all of you, most dearly beloved, to keep not only your eyes, but also your
tongue, pure. And let not another house ever know by your means what is done in any
man’s house. Let all have the simplicity of the dove, that they devise not guile against any
one; and the subtlety of the serpent, that they be not ever thrown by the crafty designs of
others. It does not belong to my humble station and measure to judge others, and to say
anything unfavourable of the ministers of the churches. Far be it from me that I should say
anything unfavourable of those who are the successors to the apostolic status, and make the
body of Christ with their sacred mouth; by whose instrumentality we too are Christians,
and who have the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and exercise judgment before the day of
judgment. Moreover, it is contained in the ancient law, that whoever has not given obedience
to the priests should either be stoned outside the camp by the people, or with his neck beneath
the sword should expiate his presumption by his blood.2813</p>
<p>Now, however, the disobedient is cut off by spiritual chastisement; and being cast out
of the church, is torn by the rabid mouth of demons.2814 For it becomes those who have
God in their heritage, to serve God free from all the hindrances of the world, so that they
may be able to say, “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.”2815 “O how good and
pleasant is Thy Spirit, O Lord, in all things!”2816 And Thou sparest all because they are
Thine, O Lord, who lovest souls. Therefore chastenest Thou them by little and little that offend,
and warnest them of those things wherein they offend, and dost address them, that
leaving their wickedness, they may believe on Thee, O Lord.”2817 “But Thou, our God, art
gracious and true, long-suffering, and in mercy ordering all things. For if we sin, we are
Thine, knowing Thy power. And if we sin not, we know that we are counted Thine.”2818
“The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall be required of him; and in His regard they shall
be blessed.”2819 Wherefore, most beloved brethren, “let no corrupt communication proceed

out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace
to the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be
put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving
one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.”2820 “Be ye therefore followers of
God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself
for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour. But fornication, and
all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving
of thanks. For this know ye, understanding that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath
of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. For
ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light (for
the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth), proving what is acceptable
unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them
in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever is
made manifest (manifestatur) is light. Wherefore He saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly,
brethren, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore
be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with
wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Holy Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms,
and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;
giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.”2821 Therefore, brethren,
stand fast and hold the tradition of the apostles and the apostolic seat, “that our Lord Jesus
Christ and our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and
good hope through grace, may comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good work
and word.”2822 “Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free
course, and be glorified, even as it is with you, and that we may be delivered from unreasonable
and wicked men: for all men have not faith. But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish
you, and keep you from evil.”2823 Wherefore set your hearts continually in the strength

of the prophet, “to the generations following; for this God is our God unto eternity, and He
will rule us for ever and ever.”2824 Hence ye who are set for examples (in specula) by the
Lord, ought by all means to check and keep back those who devise crafty counsels against
the brethren, or excite against them seditions and slanders. For it is an easy thing to deceive
man with a word, but it is not so with the Lord. Wherefore ye ought to reprehend such
persons, and turn away from them, to the end that, all darkness of this manner being completely
done away, the Morning Star may shine upon them, and gladness arise in their hearts.
“And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, brethren, that ye both do and will do
the things which we command you.”2825 For the more ye show forth your kindnesses to
them, the greater a return have ye to look for from the omnipotent God whom they serve.
May the omnipotent God keep you in His protection, and grant you to maintain honour
and precept; and may glory and honour be to God the Father Almighty, and to His onlybegotten
Son our Saviour, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>The Epistles of Pope Fabian.2826</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1">
<head>The First Epistle.</head>
<head>To All the Ministers of the Church Catholic.</head>
<p>Of those who ought not to be admitted to clear themselves, and of the duty of having no fellowship
with the excommunicated.</p>
<p>To the dearly-beloved brethren in the ministry of the Church Catholic in all regions,
Fabian sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>By the divine precepts and the apostolic institutes, we are admonished to watch in behoof
of the position of all the churches with unwearied interest. Whence it follows that you ought
to know what is being done in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following
her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly,
as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in
the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined
on them week by week, and on the Lord’s days and the solemn festivals, in concert
with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves
in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon
them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient,
that religious duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay
or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall
stand by (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the
histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge
you all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in later times; “for
whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.”2827 And whatsoever things
are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore
we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be
found in them, from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful.
For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that the holy Church may
now find the good-will of your love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour
whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that

we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you
as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions,
your virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches
by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you also, according to the word of the
apostle, to be “stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch
as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.”2828 And in another place: “Watch ye,
and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be
done with charity.”2829 Furthermore, we desire you to know this, that in our times, as our
sins embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion,
seeking whom he may devour,2830 instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and
separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and
persuaded them into the acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep
yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine different from that which
the apostles and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going
after him ye fall into the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most
earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it fit to remember our
insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we,
as well as our holy mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may
be delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from troublesome and
wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free course and be glorified, and that the
evil doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown
and perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious supplications, that
our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men to be saved, and no one to perish,2831
may, by His vast omnipotence, cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the
Catholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are held
captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the Church. Be mindful also
of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power,
that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your
goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve yourselves as obedient and
faithful children of the holy Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward.
These men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true
faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded with infamy, and
are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the Church by the sword of the apostles,

until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in
agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all
who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers
of those who hold the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore
are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the
true faith, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the
faith of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing
of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times future
alike anathematize. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the
unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded,
by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them;
and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance,
lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the
pit of such persons, into which we know many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts)
of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those
closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by
which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them
far off from you. Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as
doves.2832 See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other’s
prayers and supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons whom I
have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things.
In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention
when he says, “with such persons, no, not to eat;”2833 since these latter, as well as the former,
are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the
Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse
with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought
not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought
to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these
too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have
the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held. And if
any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the excommunicated in his house, or
speaks or prays in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion.
Such persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be
received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are
condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them.2834 Whence also the

blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says
this among other things:2835 If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his deeds,
wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But
mark ye carefully his will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and
separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be inimical, and speak not
with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires
to possess the friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation all the
more quickly with him who presides over all, so that he may return to spiritual well-being
(redeat et salutem) hereby, when he begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.</p>
<p>If, however, any one is not friendly, and speaks with those with whom he (his chief)
speaks not, such an one belongs to those who seek to exterminate the Church of God; and
though he seems to be with you in body, he is against you in mind and heart. And such an
one is a much more dangerous enemy than those who are without, and who are openly
hostile. For this man under the guise of friendship acts the part of an enemy, and scatters
and ruins the church. And therefore, dearly beloved, in these apostolic institutes we warn
and teach you, that your charity, being instructed therein (effecta certior), may hereafter
study to act with greater care and prudence, so that perverse and unbelieving men may not
have the power of injuring the faithful and well-disposed; for the hope of such, and of all
the ungodly, is like dust that is blown away with the wind; and like a thin froth that is driven
away with the storm; and like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest,
and as the remembrance of a guest of a single day that passeth away.2836 With the utmost
care, dearly beloved, are such persons to be guarded against, and avoided, and rejected, if
they show themselves injurious. For the laws of the world, no less than those of the Church,
do not admit the injurious, but reject them. Whence it is written, “The mouth of the wicked
devoureth iniquity.”2837 And the Lord, speaking by the prophet, saith, “With the holy thou
wilt show thyself holy; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward; and with the
excellent thou wilt show thyself excellent (electus); and with the innocent man thou wilt
show thyself innocent.”2838 And the apostle says, “Evil communications corrupt good
manners.”2839 Wherefore, as has already been indicated, the wicked are always to be avoided
and shunned, and the good and rightly-disposed are to be stedfastly followed, in order that,
as far as possible, we may avoid the peril of sloth. And lest this pest may be spread abroad
more widely, let us cut it off from us with all possible severity; for the temerity of presumption

Lord together, and give Him thanks always without wearying. Fare ye well in the Lord,
dearly beloved, and with the Lord’s help strive to fulfil to the best of your ability the things

<p>That the chrism2841 should be renewed with consecration every year, and that the old supply
should be set aside to be burnt in the churches; also concerning the accusing of priests,
and on the duty of the sheep not to dare to blame their shepherd unless he errs in the faith.</p>
<p>Fabian, bishop of the city of Rome, to all the bishops of the East, and to the whole body
of the faithful, greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>Your love for the seat of the apostles requires counsels which we neither can nor ought
to deny you. It is clear, moreover, that our predecessors did this for the bishops of many
districts; and brotherly charity and the debt of obedience impose the duty of so doing also
upon us who, by the bountiful goodness of God, are placed in the same seat. Care, therefore,
is to be had by your solicitude, that neither remissness may avail to neglect, nor presumption
be able to disturb, those things which have been ordained by the apostles and their successors,
and established under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But as it was proper that that should
be defined which the use of right order required, so what has been so defined ought not to
be violated.</p>

<head>I.</head>
<p>That new chrism should be made every year, and the old be burnt.</p>
<p>Now, among other matters, in your letter we find it stated that certain bishops of your
district adopt a different practice from yours and ours, and do not prepare the chrism at
the Lord’s supper every year, but keep it in use for two or three, making such a supply of
the holy chrism once for all. For they say, as we find in the letter referred to, that balsam
cannot be got every year; and besides that, even though it were got, there would be no necessity
for preparing chrism every year, but that, so long as the one preparation of chrism is
sufficiently large, they have no need to make another. They are in error, however, who think
so; and in making such statements they speak like madmen rather than men in their right
senses. For on that day the Lord Jesus, after supping with His disciples, and washing their
feet, according to the tradition which our predecessors received from the holy apostles and
left to us, taught them to prepare the chrism. That washing of their feet signifies our baptism,
as it is completed and confirmed by the unction of the holy chrism. For as the solemn observance
of that day is to be kept every year, so the preparing of that holy chrism is to be
attended to every year, and it is to be renewed from year to year and given to the faithful.
For the material of this new sacrament is to be made anew every year, and on the day already
named; and the old supply is to be burned in the holy churches. These things we have received
from the holy apostles and their successors, and we commit them to your keeping.
The holy church of Rome and that of Antioch have been guardians of these things from the
times of the apostles: these things also the churches of Jerusalem and Ephesus maintain.
Presiding over these churches, the apostles taught these things, and ordained that the old
chrism should be burnt, and permitted them to use it no longer than one year, and commanded
them thereafter to use the new, and not the old material. If any one, therefore,
ventures to go against these things, let him understand that the door of indulgence is barred
against him on your part and on that of all right-minded men: for the perverse doctrine of
most depraved minds, while it uses the reins too indulgently, slips into the sin of presumption;
and it can by no means be cast out, unless it is cleared of all support and correction on the
part of the intelligent. And those usages which the holy Church throughout the whole world
uniformly observes with respect to the divine mysteries, and towards the subjects of baptism,
are not to be regarded with indifferent concern, lest we make way for purposeless efforts
and superstitions. We ought not, therefore, to bring over the untaught minds of the faithful
to such practices as we have named, because they should be instructed rather than played
upon. For good deeds make for our happiness, and evil deeds prick us with the stings of
sorrow. But here, however we are situated, we are among the hands of robbers and the teeth
of raging wolves, and the contumacious are put in the place of the true sheep. And it is by
the barking of the dogs and the staff of the shepherd that the fury of the wolves is checked.

Those wounds, moreover, which cannot be healed by remedies, must be cut out with the
knife. Neither can we keep silence, for, in seeking here to call back some from things unlawful,
we are impelled by the instinct of our office, having been set on the watch-towers by the
Lord with this object, that we should prove the diligence of our watchfulness by checking
things that should be prohibited, and deciding for things that should be observed.</p>

<head>II.</head>
<p>Of the right of bishops not to be accused or hurt by detraction.</p>
<p>You desired also to consult us, as we find in the above-mentioned letter of yours, on
the subject of the accusing of priest,—a thing which, as we learn also from the same epistle,
is exceedingly frequent among you. You have intimated, besides, that very many notice
that not a few in places of ecclesiastical dignity do not live in a manner conformable to the
discourses and sacraments with which the people are served by their means. O miserable
men, who in looking at these forget Christ, who long since indeed told us how that the law
of God should be obeyed, rather than that those should be looked to for imitation who do
not the things which they say; and bearing with the traitor himself even to the end, He sent
him also along with the rest to preach the Gospel. For the apostles had no such custom,
neither did they teach that it was one fit to be had. And to like effect their successors also,
foreseeing by the Spirit of God things to come, have determined largely on such subject.
Besides, as you read in the Acts of the Apostles, “There was at that time among them that
believed one heart and one soul; neither said any of them that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common.”2842 For there was no laying of
accusations against each other among them, except what was friendly; neither ought there
ever to be such among their followers or among believers: for the Lord says, “Do not that
to another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself.”2843 And He says also, “Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself;”2844 and,” Love worketh no ill to his neighbour.”2845 In ac-
cordance herewith, the apostles themselves and their successors decreed of old time that
those persons should not be admitted to lay accusations who were under suspicion, or who
but yesterday, or the day before, or a little time ago, were at enmity, as they come thus under
suspicion, or who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, or who are
doubtful in the matter of the true faith. In like manner is it decided to be with those whose
faith and life and liberty are unknown, or who are marked with the stains of infamy, or entangled
in the snares of offences. Again, those have neither the right nor the power to accuse
the priests or the clergy, who are incapable themselves of being made priests legitimately,
and are not of their order; for just as the priests and the other members of the clerical order
are debarred from laying accusations against the secular laity, so these latter, too, should be
debarred and excluded from the right of bringing charges against the former. And as the
former should not be admired by the latter, so the latter should not be admired by the

<pb n="1790"/>
former: for as the conversation of the priests of the Lord ought to be something separate
from the conversation of these others, so should they be separate from them also in the
matter of litigation; “for the servant of the Lord ought not to strive.”2846 To the utmost of
your power, dearly beloved brethren, do ye prohibit such accusations, and all unrighteous
and injurious emulations, because contention is to be avoided by all means. “For a just man
will fall seven times in a day, and will rise again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Rejoice
not when thine enemy falleth,” saith Solomon, “and let not thine heart be glad when
he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from
him. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious at the wicked: for the
evil have not the hope of the future, and the candle of the wicked shall be put out. Envy not
evil men, neither be thou desirous to be with them; for their mind meditates rapine, and
their lips speak deceits.”2847 Dearly beloved, beware of these things. Ponder these things,
and minister comfort to the brethren in all things; for, as the Truth says in His own person,
“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”2848 For
if in things secular each man’s right and his proper position are kept for him, how much
more ought there to be no confusion induced in matters of ecclesiastical order! And this is
a right which will be duly observed if no deference is paid to mere power, but all to equity.
Whence it is an established duty, that the bishops of each several district should exercise a
watchful care over all those who live under their rule, and in the fear of God should dispose
of all cases in which they are concerned, and of all matters in which they are interested. It
is therefore extremely inequitable that any bishops should neglect their own cases, and mix
themselves up with those of others. But those whose part it is to ordain such persons to the
priesthood, and by whom they have been already ordained, ought to order the life and
judgment of such by the exercise of a competent and regular administration; for, as the law
says, “Cursed is every one that removeth his neighbour’s landmarks. And all the people
said Amen.”2849 To this therefore, brethren, has God foreordained you, and all who hold
the highest office of the priesthood, that ye should put all injustice out of the way, and cut
off presumption, and help those who labour in the priesthood, and give no occasion for
their reproach and trouble, but bring assistance to him who endures calumny and reproach,
and cut off him who works calumny and reproach, and act for the help of the Lord in His
priests. The Lord, moreover, has chosen the priests for Himself, that they should sacrifice
to Him, and offer oblations to their Lord. He commanded the Levites also to be under them
in their ministries. Whence He speaks to Moses in these terms: “And Eleazar the son of
<note type="footnote">2846 1 Tim. ii. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">2847 Prov. xxiv. 17, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">2848 John xiii. 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">2849 Deut. xxvii. 17.</note>

<pb n="1791"/>
Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them
that keep the charge of the sanctuary.”2850 For of these the Lord spake to Moses in this
wise: “Take the Levites instead of the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle
of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.”2851 If
the Lord willed the Levites to be His own, how much more has He taken the priests for
Himself! And of these He says: “If any stranger cometh nigh, he shall be put to death.”2852
All objects, moreover, that are the Lord’s are to be handled carefully, and are not lightly to
be injured; for even among men, those are reckoned faithful who attend to the interests of
their masters rightly, and deal with them faithfully, and rightly observe the commands of
their masters, and transgress them not. And those, on the other hand, are reputed unfaithful
who deal with the interests of their masters carelessly and negligently, and despise their
commands, and do not observe them as they ought.</p>
<p>Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those who now know
it not may know this; viz., that the priests, too, whom the Lord has taken to Himself from
among all men, and has willed to be His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured,
nor rashly accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord has chosen
to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance according to His own judgment.
For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful
at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than
made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the
last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is
yet to be on the shore,—that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that
man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has reserved for His own judgment,
that the purpose of God, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may
be unalterable. And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on
matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the
apostle speaks: “Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one
with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to
be defrauded?”2853 To this, too, our Lord’s word may refer: “And if any man will take away
thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.”2854 And in another place:
“Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.”2855 Moreover, there are certain

things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of
more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother “Thou
fool” worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so?2856 Those, furthermore,
who commit those sins whereof the apostle says, “They who do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God,”2857 are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be
compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked
with the stains of infamy, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by
sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, “With
such persons, no, not to eat;”2858 because such persons are branded with infamy until they
are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our holy mother the
Church; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest
that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for
us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any
manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves
against fathers are rendered infamous. “Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear
than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.”2859 “He that wanteth understanding
thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.”2860 For
their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. “A
stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. A
heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the evil heart in them shall be made to
stumble. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon
sin.”2861 The holy apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and foreseeing,
as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked men, and having regard to the
simple, determined that the accusing of priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty,
or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men. For if this
were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but
the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case—and (which is yet worse)
that too in growing measure—that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are
hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that
such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such
should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated
<note type="footnote">2856 Matt. v. 22.</note>

above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that
bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way
the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their
property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by
any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of
their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have
had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set
in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case;
and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and
if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help
of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by
their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be
preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against
them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects,
or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and
hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops,
and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration
of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to
the court (curiæ), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall
remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at
once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be
four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and
the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock
should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned,
unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with
the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth
saith, “The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.”2862</p>
<p>And pride is hateful before God and men, and all iniquity is execrable. “The Lord hath
destroyed the memory of the proud, and hath left the memory of the humble in mind. The
seed of men shall be honoured, this seed that feareth God. But that seed shall be dishonoured
that transgresseth the commandments of the Lord. Among brethren, he that is chief is
honourable; and they that fear the Lord shall be in His eyes. My son, saith Solomon, preserve
thy soul in meekness, and give honour to him whom honour beseemeth.”2863 “Blame not
any one before thou examinest him; and when thou hast examined him, reprove him justly.
Answer not a word before thou hearest the cause; neither interrupt with talk in the midst

<pb n="1794"/>
of thy seniors.”2864 After the example of Ham the son of Noah, they are condemned who
bring the faults of their fathers into public view, or presume to accuse or calumniate them;
even as was the case with Ham, who did not cover the shame of his father Noah, but exhibited
it for mockery. And in like manner those are justified by the example of Shem and Japhet,
who reverently cover and seek not to display those matters in which they find their fathers
to have erred. For if a bishop should happen to err from the faith, he should in the first
place be corrected privately by those placed under him (a subditis suis). And if he show
himself incorrigible (which may God forbid), then an accusation should be laid against him
before his primates, or before the seat of the apostles. For his other actings, however, he is
rather to be borne with by his flock and those put under him, than accused or made the
subject of public detraction; because when any offence is committed in these matters by
those put under them, His ordinance is withstood who set them before him, as the apostle
says, “Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.”2865 But he who fears
Almighty God, agrees in no way to do anything contrary to the Gospel, or contrary to the
apostles, or contrary to the prophets or the institutions of the holy fathers. The priests
therefore are to be honoured, and not to be injured or reproached. Thus read we in Ecclesiasticus:
“Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence His priests. Love Him that made
thee with all thy strength, and forsake not His ministers. Honour God with thy whole soul,
and honour the priest, and cleanse thyself beforehand with the shoulders (propurga te cum
brachiis). Give him his portion, as it is commanded thee, of the first-fruits; and purge thyself
concerning negligence with a few things. Thou shalt offer the gift of thy shoulders, and the
sacrifice of sanctification, and the first-fruits of the holy things to the Lord. And stretch
thine hand unto the poor, that thine atonement and blessing may be perfected.”2866 We
desire these things to become known not to you only, but through you to all the brethren,
that we may abide in Christ of one accord and one mind, making no claim for ourselves
through strife or vainglory, and being pleasers not of men, but of God our Saviour. To Him
belongeth honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>The Third Epistle.</head>
<head>To Bishop Hilary.</head>
<p>That extraneous judgments should be rejected, and that the accused person should carry out
his cause in his own locality; and that every one who brings forward a charge should intimate
in writing his ability to prove it, and that if he fails to prove what he alleges, he
should bear the penalty which he advanced.</p>
<p>Fabian, to my dearly beloved brother Bishop Hilary.</p>
<p>We ought to be mindful of the grace of God to us, who, in the compassion of His own
regard, hath raised us for this reason to the summit of sacerdotal dignity, that by cleaving
to His commandments, and by being set in a certain eminence as overseers of His priests,
we may restrain things unlawful, and inculcate things that are to be followed. For we have
heard that in those western parts in which you dwell, the craft of the devil rageth so violently
against the people of Christ, and breaketh forth in delusions so manifold, that it oppresseth
and troubleth not only the secular laity, but the priests of the Lord themselves also.
Wherefore, involved as we are in deep grief, we cannot conceal what we ought severely to
correct. Accordingly a sufficient remedy must be employed for such wounds, lest a hasty
facility in the cure may prove of no service for the deadly disease of the head; and lest the
trouble, by being too easily dealt with, may involve, through the defect of an illegitimate
mode of cure, the hurt and the healers together in its evil.</p>

<p>Of those who ought not to be admitted to the right of accusation.</p>
<p>On this account, therefore, we decree and resolve, that those who are not of good conversation,
or whose life is impeachable, or whose faith and life and liberty are unknown,
should not have the power of accusing the priests of the Lord, lest vile persons should thus
be admitted to the liberty of accusing them. In like manner, those who are involved in any
matters of accusation, or who are under suspicion, should not have a voice in laying charges
against their seniors; for the voice of the suspected and the inimical is wont to oppress the

<p>Of extraneous judgments.</p>
<p>Moreover, by a general ordinance, and without prejudice to the authority of the apostles
in all things, we prohibit extraneous judgments, because it is not fit that he should be judged
by strangers, who ought to have those of his own province and those elected by himself as
his judges, unless an appeal has been made. Wherefore, if any one of the bishops is accused
on precise charges, he ought to be heard by all the bishops who are in the province; for it is
not right that an accused person should be heard elsewhere than in his own circuit. Again,
if any one is of opinion that he has a judge adverse to him, he should claim the right of appeal;
and an appellant ought to be injured by no kind of oppression or detention; but an appellant
ought to have the liberty of righting his case, when wronged, by the remedy of appeal. There
ought also to be liberty of appeal in criminal cases. And the right of appealing ought to be

<p>If, then, any one in passion brings a charge rashly against any one, mere abuse is not to
be taken for an accusation. But a certain time being allowed for dealing with the matter,
the person should profess his ability in writing to prove what he has alleged in passion; so
that, if he should happen to think better of the things he uttered in passion, and decline to
repeat or write them, the person may not be held as charged with the crime. Every one,
therefore, who adduces a charge, ought to state in writing his ability to prove it. And, indeed,
a cause should always be dealt with in the place where the charge is admitted; and the man
who fails to substantiate his allegation, should himself bear the penalty which he advanced.</p>

<p>On the question of an accused bishop appealing to the seat of the apostles.</p>
<p>It is determined, moreover, that, in the case of an accused bishop appealing to the seat
of the apostles, that should be held to be a settlement which is the decision of the pontiff of
that same seat. On all occasions, however, in cases concerning priests, let this form be
maintained, that no one be bound by a decision pronounced by another than his own
proper judge. It is the duty also of all the faithful to be ready to help the oppressed and the
miserable in their distress, in order that by the manifestation of another manner of recompense
(vindictæ) they may be able to keep the recompense (vengeance) of God from themselves.
For he offers (libat) things prosperous to the Lord who keeps off things adverse from
the afflicted. Whence it is written, “A brother aiding a brother shall be exalted.”2867 For
the Church of God ought to be without spot or wrinkle, and therefore it ought not to be
trodden and defiled by certain persons; for it is written, “My dove, my undefiled, is but
one.”2868 Hence, again, the Lord says to Moses, “There is a place with me (penes me), and
thou shalt stand upon a rock.”2869 What place is there that belongs not to the Lord, seeing
that all things consist in Him by whom they were created? There is a place, however, with
God—to wit, the unity of the holy Church—in which there is a standing upon a rock, while
the perfection of the confession (confessionis soliditas) is held in lowliness. We admonish
thee, our brother, and all our brethren who are rulers in the Church of Christ, which He
hath purchased with His blood, to keep back, by whatever checks ye possess, all men from
that abyss into which some brethren are slipping, in reviling the Lord’s pastors, and persecuting
them both by word and deed; and we counsel you not to suffer them to be wounded
with the hook of passion: for it is written, “For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness
of God.”2870 Hence it is said again, “Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak,
and slow to wrath.”2871 Now I doubt not that with God’s help you observe all these things;
but as an occasion for counsel has arisen, I also secretly attach my word to your good desires
and deeds, so that what you are doing of yourselves and independently of admonition you
may do presently not by yourselves alone, now that the counsellor himself is added to you.
Wherefore, brethren, it becomes you and all the faithful to love each other, and not to calumniate
or accuse one another: for it is written, “Love thy neighbour, and be faithful unto
him. But if thou bewrayest his secrets, thou shalt follow no more after him. For as a man

who destroyeth his friend, so is he that loseth the love of his neighbour. And as one that
letteth a bird go out of his hand, so art thou who hast let thy neighbour go, and shalt not
get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he is as a roe escaped out of
the snare, since his soul is wounded. Further thou wilt not be able to bind him up, and after
reviling there may be reconcilement; but to bewray the secrets of a friend is the despair of
an unhappy mind. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and every one will cast him
off. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words. But at last he
will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like
him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his own
head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds in the deceiver. Whoso diggeth a pit shall
fall therein; and he that placeth a stone in his neighbour’s way shall stumble thereon; and
he that setteth a trap for another shall perish in it. He that worketh mischief, it shall fall
upon him; and he shall not know whence it cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are
from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. They that rejoice at the
fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they
die. Wrath and fury are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both.”2872
“He that desireth to be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep
his sins in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done thee; so shall
thy sins also be forgiven thee when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another,
and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? He showeth no mercy to a man which is like
himself, and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins from the Most High? He, though he
is but flesh, nourishes hatred; and does he implore mercy from God? Who will entreat for
pardon of his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease. For corruption and death
impend on His commandments. Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy
neighbour. Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the ignorance of thy
neighbour. Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins. For a furious man will
kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and will make debate among them that
be at peace. For according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and according as
a man’s strength is, so will his wrath be; and according to his riches, his anger will rise. An
hasty contention will kindle a fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing
(testificans) tongue will cause death. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn like a fire; and if
thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched; and both these come out of thy mouth. The
whisperer and double-tongued is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at peace. A
backbiting (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation.
Strong cities of the rich hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It
has destroyed the strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting tongue
<note type="footnote">2872 Ecclus. xxvii. 17–30.</note>

<pb n="1802"/>
hath cast out virtuous women (viratas, spirited), and deprived them of their labours. Whoso
hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose.
The stroke of the whip maketh marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the
bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the
tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, and hath not passed through the
venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands.
For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The death
thereof is an evil death, and the grave were better than it. Its endurance shall not abide, but
it shall possess the ways of the unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous.
Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched;
and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears
(sæpi aures) about with thorns, and refuse to listen to the evil tongue, and make a door for
thy mouth and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and thy silver, and make a balance
for thy words, and a right bridle for thy mouth. And beware lest thou slide perchance in
thy tongue, and fall in the sight of thine enemies that be in wait for thee, and thy fall be irremediable
unto death.”2873 Let all beware of these things, and “keep thy tongue from evil,
and thy lips from speaking guile.”2874 “Finally, dearly beloved, be strong in the Lord, and
in the power of His might. Put on the armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against
the wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities
and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
heavenly places (coelestibus). Wherefore take unto you the armour of God, that ye may be
able to withstand in the evil day, and to stand perfect in all (omnibus perfecti). Stand
therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness,
and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; in all (in omnibus)
taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God.”2875 It is our wish, brother, that those things which we have written to you should be
made known generally to all, in order that things which touch the others should be made
known to all. May Almighty God protect you, brother, and all our brethren everywhere
situate, even to the end,—even He who has thought good to redeem the whole world, our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever. Amen.—Given on the 16th day of October, in
the consulship of the most illustrious Africanus and Decius.</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>
<p>I
(From Clement to Melchiades, p. 607.)</p>
<p>The early Bishops of Rome, who till the time of Sylvester (a.d. 325) were, with few exceptions,
like him pure and faithful shepherds, and not lords over God’s heritage, shall here
be enumerated. But first let us settle in few words the historic facts as to the See.</p>
<p>St. Paul was, clearly, the Apostolic founder of the Roman church, as appears from Holy
Scripture. St. Peter seems to have come to Rome not long before his martyrdom. Linus
and Cletus could not have been Bishops of Rome, for they were merely coadjutors of the
Apostles during their lifetime. Clement was the first who succeeded to their work after their
death; and thus he should unquestionably be made the first of the Roman bishops,—a position
of which he was eminently worthy, for his was the spirit of St. Peter himself,2884 as set forth
in that incomparable passage of his first Epistle,2885 in which the Apostle bids all his brethren
to be shepherds indeed, and “ensamples to the flock.” We may therefore give the outline
of this history as follows:—</p>
<p>1. St. Paul was the “Apostle of the Gentiles,” and St. Peter of “the Circumcision.”</p>
<p>2. St. Paul came first to Rome, and organized the Christians he found there after the
pattern “ordained in all the churches.”</p>
<p>3. He had Linus for his coadjutor, being himself a prisoner, until he went into Spain.</p>
<p>4. St. Peter came to Rome (circa a.d. 64), and laboured with the Jewish Christians there,
St. Paul recognising his mission among them.</p>
<p>5. This Apostle (soon thrown into prison) had Cletus for his coadjutor.</p>
<p>6. In the Neronian persecution Linus seem to have suffered with St. Paul, and probably
Cletus as well. The latter died before St. Peter.</p>
<p>7. St. Peter, therefore, about to suffer himself, ordains Clement to succeed him.</p>
<p>8. As he was the first “successor of the Apostles,” therefore, in the See of Rome, and the
first who had jurisdiction there (for the Apostles certainly never surrendered their mission
to their coadjutors), it follows that Clement was the first Bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>9. This is confirmed by the earliest testimony,—that of Ignatius.</p>
<p>10. It agrees with Tertullian’s testimony, and he speaks (as a lawyer and expert) from
“the registers.” Irenæus, speaking less precisely, may be harmonized with these testimonies
without violence to what he reports.</p>
<note type="footnote">2884 See his genuine Epistle, vol. i. p. 1, this series. Compare vol. i. pp. 69, 416, with vii. p. 478.</note>
<note type="footnote">2885 1 Pet. v. 1–4. The Bishops of Rome have only to restore themselves to the spirit of St. Peter as here set
forth, and the schisms of the churches will be at an end. For Tertullian’s testimony, see vol. iii. p. 258, note 9.</note>

<p>29. Melchiades a.d. 311–314.</p>
<p>30. Sylvester a.d. 314–335.</p>
<p>N.B.—After a.d. 325 the Bishops of Rome are canonical primates; the Bishops of New
Rome primates equally, but second on the list; then Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus. The
Councils of Constantinople and Chalcedon state that these primacies were awarded because
Rome and New Rome were the capitals of the oecumene, or empire. The primacy conferred
no authority over the sister Sees of Apostolic foundation, and recognised no inequality
among bishops, save those of such honorary distinction.</p>
<pb n="1810"/>
<p>The Patriarchate.</p>
<p>1. From (a.d. 325) Sylvester to Gregory the Great, and his successor, who lived but one
year, the Bishops of Rome were canonical primates.</p>
<p>2. Boniface III. accepted the court title of “Universal Bishop” (a.d. 606) from the Emperor
Phocas, but it was not recognised by the Church.</p>
<p>3. From this time to Adrian I. many Bishops of Rome vied with those of Constantinople
to augment their honour and power. The establishment of the Western Empire (a.d. 800)
made their ambitious claims acceptable to the Latins; and they became primates of all
Christendom in Western estimation, with extra-canonical and indefinite claims as “successors
of St. Peter.”</p>
<p>4. Nicholas I. (a.d. 863), by means of the False Decretals, gave shape to these extra-canonical
claims, abrogated the Nicene Constitutions in the West by making these Decretals
canon-law, and asserted a supremacy over the old patriarchares, which they never allowed:
hence the schism of the West from the Apostolic Sees of the East, and from the primitive
discipline which established the Papacy, as now understood.</p>
<p>5. From Nicholas I. (who died a.d. 867) the Latin churches recognised this Papacy more
or less; the Gallicans resisting, though feebly, by asserting their “liberties,” according to
Nicene Constitutions.</p>
<p>6. Gregory VII., honestly persuaded that the Decretals were authentic, enforced these
spurious canons without reference to antiquity, and pronounced the title of “Pope” the sole
and peculiar dignity of the Bishops of Rome a.d. 1073. He reigned from a.d. 1061 to 1085.</p>
<p>7. The churches of England and France, which claimed to be outside of the “holy Roman
Empire,” under kings whose own crowns were “imperial,” maintained a perpetual contest
with the Papacy, admitted the extra-canonical “primacy,” but resisted all claims to “supremacy.”</p>
<p>8. School-doctrines were framed and enforced, but were extra-symbolic, and of no
Catholic authority. They abused the episcopate to exalt the Papacy.</p>
<p>9. The Council of Trent, after the Northern revolt from the Papacy and School-doctrine,
sat seventeen years (from a.d. 1545 to a.d. 1563) framing the “Roman-Catholic Church” out
of the remainder of national churches, depriving them of their nationalities, and making
out of them all, with the missions in America, one mixed confederation, to which it gave a
new creed and new organic laws; debasing the entire episcopate (which it denied to be an
order distinct from that of presbyters), and making the Pope the “Universal Bishop,” with
other bishops reduced to presbyters, acting as his local vicars.</p>
<p>10. The Gallicans feebly withstood these changes, and strove to maintain the primitive
Constitutions by accommodations with their theory of the “Gallican liberties,” as founded
by St. Louis.</p>

<pb n="1811"/>
<p>11. Gallicanism was extinguished by Pope Pius IX., who proclaimed the Pope “infallible,”
and thus raised his “supremacy” into an article of the Roman-Catholic faith.</p>
<p>12. The following is the modern creed of “Roman Catholics,” which, with the latest
additions, embodies a library of dogmas in the eleventh article, and now, since the decree
of Infallibility makes the entire Bullary (a vast library of decrees and definitions), equally
part of the Creed.2886</p>
<p>The Trentine Creed, or the Creed of Pius IV., a.d. 1564.</p>
<p>1. I most stedfastly admit and embrace Apostolical and ecclesiastical traditions, and all
other observances and constitutions of the Church.</p>
<p>2. I also admit the Holy Scripture according to that sense which our holy mother the
Church has held, and does hold, to which it belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretations
of the Scriptures. Neither will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than according
to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.</p>
<p>3. I also profess that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of the New Law,
instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary for the salvation of mankind, though not
all for every one; to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction,
Order, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace; and that of these, Baptism, Confirmation,
and Order cannot be reiterated without sacrilege. I also receive and admit the received and
approved ceremonies of the Catholic Church in the solemn administration of the aforesaid
sacraments.</p>
<p>4. I embrace and receive all and every one of the things which have been defined and
declared in the holy Council of Trent concerning original sin and justification.</p>
<p>5. I profess, likewise, that in the Mass there is offered to God a true, proper, and propitiatory
sacrifice for the living and the dead; and that in the most holy sacrament of the
Eucharist there is truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood, together with the soul
and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that there is made a conversion of the whole
substance of the bread into the body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood,
which conversion the Catholic Church calls Transubstantiation. I also confess that under
either kind alone Christ is received whole and entire, and a true sacrament.</p>
<note type="footnote">2886 De Maistre, thinking to overthrow the Anglicans, and imagining the Thirty-nine Articles to be “terms
of communion” in the Anglican Church, where they never were, commits himself rashly to the following position:
“If a people possess one of these Codes of Belief, we may be sure of this: that the religion of such a people is
false.” No people on earth has such as enormous Code of Belief as those who profess the creed of Pius the Fourth,
and who accept the decrees of Pius the Ninth. See De Maistre, Le Principe Générateur, etc., p. 20, Paris, 1852.
This Trent Creed is the fruit of the Decretals.</note>

<pb n="1812"/>
<p>6. I constantly hold that there is a Purgatory, and that the souls therein detained are
helped by the suffrages of the faithful.</p>
<p>7. Likewise, that the saints, reigning together with Christ, are to be honoured and invocated,
and that they offer prayers to God for us, and that their relics are to be respected.</p>
<p>8. I most firmly assert that the images of Christ, of the mother of God, ever virgin, and
also of the saints, ought to be had and retained, and that due honour and veneration is to
be given them.</p>
<p>9. I also affirm that the power of indulgences was left by Christ in the Church, and that
the use of them is most wholesome to Christian people.</p>
<p>10. I acknowledge the Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church for the mother and
mistress of all churches; and I promise true obedience to the Bishop of Rome, successor to
St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>11. I likewise undoubtedly receive and profess all other things delivered, defined, and
declared by the sacred Canons, and general Councils, and particularly by the holy Council
of Trent.</p>
<p>12. And I condemn, reject, and anathematize all things contrary thereto, and all heresies
whatsoever, condemned, rejected, and anathematized by the Church.</p>
<p>This true Catholic faith, without which no one can be saved, I N.N. do at this present
freely confess and sincerely hold; and I promise most constantly to retain, and confess the
same entire and unviolated, with God’s assistance, to the end of my life. Amen.</p>
<p>N. B.—(1) To this was added, Dec. 8, 1854, the new article of the Immaculate Conception
of the Virgin Mary, to be believed as necessary to salvation.</p>
<p>N. B.—(2) To which was added (December, 1864) the whole Syllabus.</p>
<p>N. B.—(3) To which was added (July 18, 1870) the new dogma of Infallibility.</p>
<p>Observe, this “Creed” is imposed on all in the Roman Obedience, and especially on
those who enter it from other communions, as that without which no one can be saved. The
Catholic Creed of Nicæa is not sufficient. But the Seventh Canon of Ephesus not only forbids
the composition of any other creed, but especially adds: “Those who shall presume to compose
another creed, or to produce or offer it to persons desiring to return to the acknowledgment
of the truth…from any heresy whatever, shall be deposed…if bishops or other clergy, and
if they be laymen they shall be anathematized.”</p>
<pb n="1813"/>
<p>II.</p>
<p>(Donation of Constantine, p. 607.)</p>
<p>On this stupendous fraud I quote from Dupin, as follows:—</p>
<p>“Among the number of Constantine’s edicts I do not place the Donation which goes
under his name. Some have attributed this false monument to the author of the collection
(Decretals) ascribed to Isidore, he being a notorious forger of such kind of writings; and
this conjecture is more probable than some others.</p>
<p>“By this Donation, Constantine is supposed to give to the Bishops of Rome the sovereignty
of the city, and of the provinces of the Western Empire. I note some of the reasons
which clearly prove this instrument to be a forgery:—</p>
<p>“(1) Not one of the ancients mentions this pretended liberality of the emperor. How
could Eusebius, and all the other historians who wrote about Constantine, have passed over
in silence, had it been a reality, the gift of a Western Empire to the Bishop of Rome?</p>
<p>“(2) Not one of the Bishops of Rome ever refers to such a donation, though it would
have been much to their advantage so to do.</p>
<p>“(3) It is dated falsely, and under consuls who flourished when Constantine was unbaptized;
yet his baptism is referred to in this instrument. Again, the city of Constantinople is
mentioned in it, although it was called Byzantium for ten years subsequent to its date.</p>
<p>“(4) Not only is the style very different from the genuine edicts of the emperor, but it
is full of terms and phrases that came into use much after the time of Constantine.</p>
<p>“(5) How comes it that he should have given one-half of his empire to the Bishop of
Rome, including the city of Rome itself, without any one ever hearing of it for hundreds of
years after?</p>
<p>“(6) The falsities and absurdities of this edict demonstrate that it was composed by an
ignorant impostor. Thus by it, for example, the Pope is permitted to wear a crown of gold,
and a fabulous history is given of the emperor’s baptism by Sylvester: also, it contains a
history of the emperor’s miraculous cure of leprosy by Sylvester, all which do plainly prove
the forgery. It is certain that the city of Rome was governed by the emperor, and that the
Bishops of Rome were subject to him, and obeyed him, as all his other subjects.</p>
<p>“All that we have said plainly shows that the edict of Donation that bears the name of
Constantine is wholly supposititious; but it is not so easy to find out who was the author.
However it be, this document has neither any use nor authority.”2887</p>
<note type="footnote">2887 Dupin, ut supra, p. 17. See also Bryce’s Holy Roman Empire, pp. 43 and 100. He pronounces “the
Donation of Constantine” to be “the most stupendous of all the mediæval forgeries. The Decretals certainly
surpass it in their nature and their effects; but Mr. Bryce’s reference to these is very feeble and unsatisfactory,
after Dupin. See p. 156 of his work, ed. Macmillan, 1880.</note>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Memoirs of Edessa and Other Syriac Documents.</head>
<p>The Syriac Documents here subjoined are to be regarded as interesting relics of the
primitive ages, but neither wholly genuine nor in details authentic. They have been interpolated
and corrupted so as to reflect, in some particulars, ideas wholly repugnant to those
of Christian antiquity, and which first received currency in the period of the Iconoclastic
controversy.2888 Yet the pages of Eusebius bear witness to the Edessene legends as of very
early origin, and it is reasonable to suppose that they rest on some inquiries made by the
contemporary Abgar concerning the great Prophet who had appeared in Galilee. The visit
of the Wise Men from the East, and the history of Naaman the Syrian, lend antecedent
probability to the idea that such inquiries may have been made. The mission of Thaddæus
seems a historical fact; and if he found Abgar predisposed to believe, and familiar with the
story of the Christ, the growth of the whole fable is sufficiently accounted for. Let me quote
Wake in the Preliminary Discourse to his Apostolic Fathers. He says:2889 “That both the
intercourse reported by Eusebius between our Saviour and this prince (Abgarus), and the
report of the picture being brought to him, have been received as a matter of unquestionable
truth in those parts, the authority of Gregorius Abulpharagius2890 will not suffer us to
doubt.…But Gelasius2891 pronounced the epistle of our Saviour to be apocryphal.…Natalis
Alexander judges both it and the reply of Abgar supposititious; and Dupin, after him, yet
more solidly convicts it of such manifest errors as may satisfy all considering persons that
Eusebius and Ephraem were too easy of belief in this particular, and did not sufficiently
examine into it.”2892</p>
<p>But I cannot do better than refer the inquirer to Jones’ work On the Canon,2893 where,
even in early youth, I found the whole matter, and the story of the portrait of our Saviour,
<note type="footnote">2888 Had the early Christians used icons,—i.e., pictures in their churches,—the churches themselves would

attractive reading. I owe to that work my initiation into the study of what I am now endeavouring
to elucidate, in some degree, for others. I subjoin the words of Lardner,2894 in concluding
his candid examination of the matter, as follows: “The whole history is the fiction
of some Christian at Edessa, in the time of Eusebius or not long before. The people of Edessa
were then generally Christians; and they valued themselves upon it, and were willing to do
themselves the honour of a very early conversion to the Christian faith. By some one of
them, or more united together, this history was formed, and was so far received by Eusebius
as to be thought by him not improper to be inserted in his Ecclesiastical History.”</p>
<p>I conclude that Eusebius was led to put some confidence in it by the antecedent probab-
ility to which I have referred, favouring the idea that some knowledge of Christ had penetrated
the mind and heart of Abgar even in our Saviour’s lifetime. This idea receives some
countenance from the fact recorded by St. Matthew:2895 “His fame went throughout all
Syria; and they brought unto Him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases,” etc.</p>
<p>The remarks I have quoted from the learned will sufficiently prepare the reader for the
other Syriac Documents which follow these Edessene Memoirs, as I find it convenient to call
them.</p>
<p>Here follows the Introductory Notice by the translator:—</p>
<p>These Documents were selected by the late Dr. Cureton, from manuscripts acquired by
the British Museum from the Nitrian Monastery in Lower Egypt, of which the first portion
arrived in 1841, the second in 1843, and a third in 1847. The preparation of them for publication
occupied the closing days of his life. It is to be regretted that his death occurred
before he was able to write a preface: the more so because, to use the words of Dr. W. Wright,
the editor of the posthumous work, “he had studied the questions connected with this
volume for years and from every point of view.” In a note occurring in the preface to his
Festal Letters of Athanasius,2896 he says: “I have found among the Syriac mss. in the British
Museum a considerable portion of the original Aramaic document which Eusebius cites as
preserved in the archives of Edessa, and various passages from it quoted by several authors,
with other testimonies which seem to be sufficient to establish the fact of the early conversion
of the inhabitants of that city, and among them of the king himself, although his successors
afterwards relapsed into paganism. These, together with accounts of the martyrdom of
some of the first bishops of that city, forming a most interesting accession to our knowledge
of the early propagation of Christianity in the East down to about a.d. 300, I have already
transcribed, and hope to publish.” “He was himself firmly persuaded,” adds Dr. Wright,
“of the genuineness of the Epistles attributed to Abgar, king of Edessa, and our Lord: an

<pb n="1817"/>
opinion which he shared with such illustrious scholars as Baronius, Tillemont, Cave, R.
Mountague (Bishop of Norwich), and Grabe.”</p>
<p>Without attempting here to decide what degree of historical value belongs to these
Documents, it may be proper to observe that the several matters contained in them are so
far distinct from one another that they do not necessarily stand or fall together. Such matters
are: the celebrated Epistles, the conversion of King Abgar Uchomo, the visit of Thaddæus,
and the early prevalence of Christianity at Edessa. With regard to the letters said to have
passed between Abgar and our Lord, it seems sufficient, without referring to the internal
evidence, to remark, with Lardner and Neander, that it is inconceivable how anything
written by Christ should have remained down to the time of Eusebius unknown to the rest
of the world2897 The conversion of Abgar is a distinct matter of inquiry. But on this again,
doubt, to say the least, is cast by the statement that Abgar Bar Manu, who reigned between
the years 160 and 170 a.d., is the first king of Edessa on whose coins the usual symbols of
the Baal-worship of the country are wanting, these being replaced in his case by the sign of
the Cross.2898 If this refers to a complete series of the coins of Edessa, the evidence afforded
must be considered very strong. For although, to take a parallel instance, “we seek in vain
for Christian emblems on the coinage of Constantine, the first Christian emperor,”2899 this
may readily be accounted for by his preference of military distinction to the humbler honours
conferred by his new faith, whilst it does not appear that anti-Christian emblems are found,
and on the coins of his son and successor Christian emblems do make their appearance.
The other two subjects referred to do not lie under the same suspicion. There is nothing in
the nature of the case to disprove the visit of Thaddæus (or Addæus)—nothing improbable
in the fact itself, whatever judgment may be formed of the details of it presented to us here.
If, however, the visit of Thaddæus also should have to be ranked among apocryphal stories,
this would not affect the remaining point—that with which we are chiefly concerned in
these Documents. “It is certain,” says Neander, “that Christianity was early diffused in this
country.” How early, is not so certain. But the evidence furnished by the later portions of
these Documents, which there is nothing to contradict and much to confirm, proves that
early in the second century Christianity had already made many converts there. The martyrdoms
of Sharbil and Barsamya are said to have occurred a.d. 113,2900 the year in which
Trajan conquered the Parthian kingdom, of which Edessa was a part; and, whilst the pagan
element was plainly predominant, we find the Christians sufficiently numerous to have a

bishop and presbyters and deacons. This sufficiently falls in with the proof already adduced
of the conversion of even a king of Edessa about fifty years later.</p>
<p>To the Documents which are presumably of the ante-Nicene age, Dr. Cureton added
two Metrical Homilies by Jacob of Serug, who lived in the next century. But, as they are so
closely connected with the most interesting portions of the rest, the martyrdoms, and are
besides of considerable merit as compositions, the decision of the editors to insert them
will, it is presumed, be approved by most readers. The two supplemental portions, one from
the Latin of Simeon Metaphrastes, and the other from Le Vaillant de Florival’s French
translation of Moses of Chorene, have also been inserted.</p>
<p>The translation of the Syriac portions, although made with Dr. Cureton’s version constantly
in sight, may fairly be considered as independent. The only matter in which his authority
has been relied on is—in the case of proper names, the supply of the necessary
vowels,—for the text is vowelless. And even to this, one exception occurs, in the Martyrdom
of Barsamya, where “Evaristus” has been adopted instead of his “Erastus.” In regard to the
sense, it has been frequently found necessary to differ from him, while a style somewhat
freer, though, it is hoped, not less faithful, has been employed. The Metrical Homilies also
have been arranged so as to present the appearance of poetry. The results of Dr. Wright’s
collation of the text with the mss. have also contributed to the greater correctness of the
work.</p>
<p>The translator desires very thankfully to acknowledge his obligations to Dr. R. Payne
Smith, Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Oxford,2901 the progress of whose
Thesaurus Syriacus is regarded with so much satisfaction and hope, for his kindness in furnishing
much valuable information respecting matters on which the lexicons are silent.</p>
<p>The notes marked Tr. are by the translator. The others, where the contrary is not indicated,
are, at least in substance, Dr. Cureton’s: though their citation does not always imply
approval.2902</p>

<note type="footnote">2902 The translator takes the opportunity of correcting the error by which the preparation of Tatian’s work
in vol. iii. of the Edinburgh Series was ascribed to him. The credit of it is due in the first instance to his lamented
friend Mr. J. E. Ryland, at whose request, and subsequently by that of the editors, he undertook to correct the
manuscript, but was soon obliged by other engagements to relinquish the task. [The correction was duly made

<p>Now the story relating to Thaddæus was on this wise:—</p>
<p>While the Godhead of our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ was proclaimed among all
men by reason of the astonishing mighty-works which He wrought, and myriads, even from
countries remote from the land of Judæa, who were afflicted with sicknesses and diseases
of every kind, were coming to Him in the hope of being healed, King Abgar2906 also, who
was renowned among the nations on the east of the Euphrates for his valour, had his body
wasting away with a grievous disease, such as there is no cure for among men. And when
he heard and was informed of the name of Jesus, and about the mighty works which He
did,—for every one alike bore witness concerning Him,—he sent a letter of request by a
man belonging to him,2907 and besought Him to come and heal him of his disease.</p>
<p>But our Saviour at the time that he asked Him did not comply with his request. Yet He
deigned to give him2908 a letter in reply: for He promised him that He would send one of

His disciples, and heal his sicknesses, and give salvation2909 to him and to all who were
connected with him.2910 Nor did He delay to fulfil His promise to him: but after He was
risen from the place of the dead, and was received into heaven, Thomas2911 the apostle, one
of the twelve, as by an impulse from God, sent Thaddæus,2912 who was himself also numbered
among the seventy2913 disciples of Christ, to Edessa, to be a preacher and proclaimer of the
teaching of Christ; and the promise of Christ was through him fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thou hast in writing the evidence of these things, which is taken from the Book of Records2914
which was at Edessa: for at that time the kingdom was still standing.2915 In the
documents, then, which were there, in which was contained whatever was done by those of
old down to the time of Abgar, these things also are found preserved down to the present
hour. There is, however, nothing to prevent our hearing the very letters themselves, which
have been taken by us2916 from the archives, and are in words to this effect, translated from
Aramaic into Greek.</p>
<p>Copy of the letter which was written by King2917 Abgar to Jesus, and sent to Him by
the hand of Hananias,2918 the Tabularius,2919 to Jerusalem:—</p>

that of Thomas, seems to have been the very common one, Judas.</note>

been still kept at Edessa in a.d. 550. [Compare this fact with Tertullian’s statement, vol. iii. p. 164.]</note>

<p>“Abgar the Black,2920 sovereign2921 of the country, to Jesus, the good Saviour, who has
appeared in the country of Jerusalem: Peace. I have heard about Thee,2922 and about the
healing which is wrought by Thy hands without drugs and roots. For, as it is reported, Thou
makest the blind to see, and the lame to walk; and Thou cleansest the lepers, and Thou
castest out unclean spirits and demons, and Thou healest those who are tormented with
lingering diseases, and Thou raisest the dead. And when I heard all these things about Thee,
I settled in my mind one of two things: either that Thou art God, who hast come down
from heaven, and doest these things or that Thou art the Son of God, and doest these things.
On this account, therefore, I have written to beg of Thee that Thou wouldest weary Thyself
to come to me, and heal this disease which I have. For I have also heard that the Jews murmur
against Thee, and wish to do Thee harm. But I have a city, small and beautiful, which is
sufficient for two.”</p>
<p>Copy of those things which were written2923 by Jesus by the hand of Hananias, the
Tabularius, to Abgar, sovereign of the country:—</p>
<p>“Blessed is he that hath believed in me, not having seen me. For it is written2924 concerning
me, that those who see me will not believe in me, and that those will believe who
have not seen me, and will be saved. But touching that which thou hast written to me, that
I should come to thee—it is meet that I should finish here all that for the sake of which I
have been sent and, after I have finished it, then I shall be taken up to Him that sent me;
and, when I have been taken up, I will send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal
thy disease, and give salvation to thee and to those who are with thee.”</p>
<p>To these letters, moreover, is appended the following also in the Aramaic tongue:—</p>
<p>“After Jesus was ascended, Judas Thomas sent to him Thaddæus the apostle, one of the
Seventy. And, when he was come, he lodged with Tobias, son of Tobias. And, when the
news about him was heard, they made it known to Abgar: “The apostle of Jesus is come
hither, as He sent thee word.” Thaddæus, moreover, began to heal every disease and sickness
by the power of God, so that all men were amazed. And, when Abgar heard the great and
marvellous cures which he wrought, he bethought himself that he was the person about
whom Jesus had sent him word and said to him: When I have been taken up, I will send to
thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thy disease. So he sent and called Tobias, with

eleventh was called Abgar Sumoco, or “the Red.” The occasion of the name “Black” is doubtful: it can hardly
have arisen from the fact that Abgar was suffering, as Cedrenus asserts, from the black leprosy.—Tr.</note>

whom he was lodging, and said to him: I have heard that a mighty man has come, and has
entered in and taken up his lodging in thy house: bring him up, therefore, to me. And when
Tobias came to Thaddæus he said to him: Abgar the king has sent and called me, and
commanded me to bring thee up to him, that thou mayest heal him. And Thaddæus said:
I will go up, because to him have I been sent with power. Tobias therefore rose up early the
next day, and took Thaddæus, and came to Abgar.</p>
<p>“Now, when they were come up, his princes happened to be standing2925 there. And
immediately, as he was entering in, a great vision appeared to Abgar on the countenance of
Thaddæus the apostle. And, when Abgar saw Thaddæus, he prostrated himself before
him.2926 And astonishment seized upon all who were standing there: for they had not
themselves seen that vision, which appeared to Abgar alone. And he proceeded to ask
Thaddæus: Art thou in truth the disciple of Jesus the Son of God, who said to me, I will
send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thee and give thee salvation? And Thaddæus
answered and said: Because thou hast mightily2927 believed on Him that sent me,
therefore have I been sent to thee; and again, if thou shalt believe on Him, thou shalt have
the requests of thy heart. And Abgar said to him: In such wise have I believed on Him, that
I have even desired to take an army and extirpate those Jews who crucified Him; were it not
that I was restrained by reason of the dominion of the Romans.2928 And Thaddæus said:
Our Lord has fulfilled the will of His Father; and, having fulfilled it, has been taken up to
His Father. Abgar said to him: I too have believed in Him and in His Father. And2929
Thaddæus said: Therefore do I lay my hand upon thee in His name. And when he had
done this, immediately he was healed of his sickness and of the disease which he had. And
Abgar marvelled, because, like as he had heard concerning Jesus, so he saw in deeds by the
hand of Thaddæus His disciple: since without drugs and roots he healed him; and not him
only, but also Abdu,2930 son of Abdu, who had the gout: for he too went in, and fell at his

did he heal, and he did great works, and preached the word of God.</p>
<p>“After these things Abgar said to him: Thou, Thaddæus, doest these things by the power
of God; we also marvel at them. But in addition to all these things I beg of thee to relate to
me the story about the coming of Christ, and in what manner it was; and about His power,
and by what power He wrought those things of which I have heard.</p>
<p>“And Thaddæus said: For the present I will be silent;2932 but, because I have been sent
to preach the word of God, assemble me tomorrow all the people of thy city, and I will
preach before them, and sow amongst them the word of life; and will tell them about the
coming of Christ, how it took place; and about His mission,2933 for what purpose he was
sent by His Father; and about His power and His deeds, and about the mysteries which He
spake in the world, and by what power He wrought these things, and about His new
preaching,2934 and about His abasement and His humiliation, and how He humbled and
emptied and abased Himself, and was crucified, and descended to Hades,2935 and broke
through the enclosure2936 which had never been broken through before, and raised up the
dead, and descended alone, and ascended with a great multitude to His Father.2937</p>
<p>“Abgar, therefore, commanded that in the morning all the people of his city should assemble,
and hear the preaching of Thaddæus. And afterwards he commanded gold and
silver to be given to him; but he received it not, and said: If we have forsaken that which
was our own, how shall we accept that of others?”</p>

<p>Edessa sent to Christ by an epistle to come to her and enlighten her. On behalf of all
the peoples did she make intercession to Him that He would leave Zion, which hated Him,
and come to the peoples, who loved Him.</p>
<p>She despatched a messenger to Him, and begged of Him to enter into friendship with
her. By the righteous king she made intercession to Him, that He would depart from the
Jewish people, and towards the other peoples direct His burden.</p>
<p>From among all kings one wise king did the daughter of the peoples find. Ambassador
she made him. To her Lord she sent by him: Come Thou unto me; I will forget in Thee all
idols and carved images.</p>

astray with idols, playing the wench with carved images. She loved, she much desired Him,
when He was far away, and begged Him to admit her into His chamber.</p>

<p>A church am I from among the peoples, and I have loved the Only-begotten who was
sent by God: whereas His betrothed hated Him, I have loved Him; and by the hands of

<p>Black am I, yet comely. Ye daughters of Zion, blameless is your envy, seeing that the

was hateful, He loved me, for He is able to make me fairer than water.</p>

<head>I.</head>
<p>Of the blessed Addæus the apostle. From his teaching which he gave in Edessa before Abgar
the King and the assembly of the city.2944</p>
<p>And, when he had entered the sepulchre, he was raised to life again, and came forth
from the sepulchre with many. And those who were guarding the sepulchre saw not how
He came forth from the sepulchre; but the watchers from on high—they were the proclaimers
and announcers of His resurrection. For, had He not willed, He had not died, because He
is Lord of death, the exit from this life; nor, had it not pleased Him, would He have put on
a body, inasmuch as He is Himself the framer of the body. For that will which led Him to
stoop to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him further to descend to the suffering of
death.—And a little after (we read): For, although His appearance was that of men, yet His
power, and His knowledge, and his authority, were those of God.</p>

<head>II.</head>
<p>From the teaching of Addæus the apostle, which was spoken in the city of Edessa.2945</p>
<p>Ye know that I said unto you, that none of the souls which go forth out of the bodies of
men are under the power of death, but that they all live and continue to exist, and that there
are for them mansions and an abode of rest. For the reasoning power of the soul does not
cease, nor the knowledge, because it is the image of the immortal God. For it is not without
perceptions, after the manner of the bodily frame, which has no perception of that corruption
which has acquired dominion over it. Recompense, however, and reward it will not receive
apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences belongs not to itself alone, but to
the bodily form also in which it dwelt for a time. But the disobedient, who have not known
God, will then repent without avail.</p>

<p>From the epistle of Addæus the apostle, which he spake in the city of Edessa.2946</p>
<p>Give heed to this ministry which ye hold, and with fear and trembling continue ye in
it, and minister every day. Minister ye not in it with neglectful habits, but with the discreetness
of faith. And let not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth, and let not any sense
of weariness come over you at the season of prayers. Give heed to the verity which ye hold,
and to the teaching of the truth which ye have received, and to the teaching of salvation
which I commit to you. Because before the tribunal of Christ will it be required of you,
when He maketh reckoning with the pastors and overseers, and when He shall take His
money from the traders with the usury of what they have taught.2947 For He is the Son of
a King, and goeth to receive a kingdom, and He will return and come and make a resuscitation
to life of all men.</p>

<head>VI.</head>
<p>From the departure2951 of Marath2952 Mary from the world, and the birth and childhood of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Book the Second.</p>
<p>In the year three hundred and forty-five, in the month of the latter Tishrin,2953 Marath
Mary went out from her house, and went to the sepulchre of Christ: because every day she
used to go and weep there. But the Jews immediately after the death of Christ seized the
sepulchre, and heaped great stones at the door of it. And over the sepulchre and Golgotha
they set guards, and commanded them that, if any one should go and pray at the sepulchre
or at Golgotha, he should immediately be put to death. And the Jews took away the cross
of our Lord, and those two other crosses, and that spear with which our Saviour was struck,
and those nails which they drove into His hands and into His feet, and those robes of
mockery in which He had been clad; and they hid them: lest, as they said, any one of the
kings or of the chief persons should come and inquire concerning the putting to death of
Christ.</p>
<p>And the guards went in and said to the priests: Mary cometh in the evening and in the
morning, and prayeth there. And there was a commotion in Jerusalem on account of Marath
Mary. And the priests went to the judge, and said to him: My lord, send and command
Mary that she go not to pray at the sepulchre and at Golgotha. And while they were deliberating,
lo! letters came from Abgar, the king of the city of Edessa, to Sabina the procurator2954
who had been appointed by Tiberius the emperor, and as far as the river Euphrates
the procurator Sabina had authority. And, because Addæus the apostle, one of the seventytwo
apostles, had gone down and built a church at Edessa, and had cured the disease with
which Abgar the king was afflicted—for Abgar the king loved Jesus Christ, and was constantly
inquiring about Him; and, when Christ was put to death and Abgar the king heard that the
Jews had slain Him on the cross, he was much displeased; and Abgar arose and rode and
came as far as the river Euphrates, because he wished to go up against Jerusalem and lay it
waste; and, when Abgar came and was arrived at the river Euphrates, he deliberated in his
mind: If I pass over, there will be enmity between me and Tiberius the emperor. And Abgar
wrote letters and sent them to Sabina the procurator, and Sabina sent them to Tiberius the
emperor. In this manner did Abgar write to Tiberius the emperor:—</p>

<p>“From Abgar, the king of the city of Edessa. Much peace to thy Majesty, our lord

the river Euphrates: for I have been wishing to go up against Jerusalem and lay her waste,
forasmuch as she has slain Christ, a skilful healer. But do thou, as a great sovereign who
hast authority over all the earth and over us, send and do me judgment on the people of
Jerusalem. For be it known to thy Majesty that I desire that thou wilt do me judgment on
the crucifiers.”</p>
<p>And Sabina received the letters, and sent them to Tiberius the emperor. And, when he
had read them, Tiberius the emperor was greatly incensed, and he desired to destroy and
slay all the Jews. And the people of Jerusalem heard it and were alarmed. And the priests
went to the governor, and said to him: My lord, send and command Mary that she go not
to pray at the sepulchre and Golgotha. The judge said to the priests: Go ye yourselves, and
give her what command and what caution ye please.</p>

<head>The Teaching of Addæus the Apostle.2960</head>
<gap reason="omitted"/>
<p>Addæus2961 said to him: Because thou hast thus believed, I lay my hand upon thee in
the name of Him in whom thou hast thus believed. And at the very moment that he laid
his hand upon him he was healed of the plague of the disease which he had for a long
time.2962 And Abgar was astonished and marvelled, because, like as he had heard about
Jesus, how He wrought and healed, so Addæus also, without any medicine whatever, was
healing in the name of Jesus. And Abdu also, son of Abdu, had the gout in his feet; and he
also presented his feet to him, and he laid his hand upon them, and healed him, and he had
the gout no more. And in all the city also he wrought great cures, and showed forth wonderful
mighty-works in it.</p>
<p>Abgar said to him: Now that every man knoweth that by the power of Jesus Christ thou
doest these miracles, and lo! we are astonished at thy deeds, I therefore entreat of thee to
relate to us the story about the coming of Christ, in what manner it was, and about His
glorious power, and about the miracles which we have heard that He did, which thou hast
thyself seen, together with thy fellow-disciples.</p>
<p>Addæus said: I will not hold my peace from declaring this; since for this very purpose
was I sent hither, that I might speak to and teach every one who is willing to believe, even
as thou. Assemble me tomorrow all the city, and I will sow in it the word of life by the
preaching which I will address to you—about the coming of Christ, in what manner it was;
and about Him that sent Him, why and how He sent Him; and about His power and His
wonderful works; and about the glorious mysteries of His coming, which He spake of in the
world; and about the unerring truth2963 of His preaching; and how and for what cause He
abused Himself, and humbled His exalted Godhead by the manhood which He took, and
was crucified, and descended to the place of the dead, and broke through the enclosure2964
which had never been broken through before, and gave life to the dead by being slain Himself,

and descended alone, and ascended with many to His glorious Father, with whom He had
been from eternity in one exalted Godhead.</p>
<p>And Abgar commanded them to give to Addæus silver and gold. Addæus said to him:
How can we receive that which is not ours. For, lo! that which was ours have we forsaken,
as we were commanded by our Lord; because without purses and without scrips, bearing
the cross upon our shoulders, were we commanded to preach His Gospel in the whole creation,
of whose crucifixion, which was for our sakes, for the redemption of all men, the
whole creation was sensible and suffered pain.</p>
<p>And he related before Abgar the king, and before his princes and his nobles, and before
Augustin, Abgar’s mother, and before Shalmath,2965 the daughter of Meherdath,2966 Abgar’s
wife,2967 the signs of our Lord, and His wonders, and the glorious mighty-works which He
did, and His divine exploits, and His ascension to His Father; and how they had received
power and authority at the same time that He was received up—by which same power it
was that he had healed Abgar, and Abdu son of Abdu, the second person2968 of his kingdom;
and how He informed them that He would reveal Himself at the end of the ages2969 and at
the consummation of all created things; also of the resuscitation and resurrection which is
to come for all men, and the separation which will be made between the sheep and the goats,
and between the faithful and those who believe not.</p>
<p>And he said to them: Because the gate of life is strait and the way of truth narrow,
therefore are the believers of the truth few, and through unbelief is Satan’s gratification.
Therefore are the liars many who lead astray those that see. For, were it not that there is a
good end awaiting believing men, our Lord would not have descended from heaven, and
come to be born, and to endure the suffering of death. Yet He did come, and us did He
send2970…of the faith which we preach, that God was crucified for2971 all men.</p>

<p>And, if there be those who are not willing2972 to agree with these our words, let them
draw near to us and disclose to us what is in their mind, that, like as in the case of a disease,
we may apply to their thoughts healing medicine for the cure of their ailments. For, though
ye were not present at the time of Christ’s suffering, yet from the sun which was darkened,
and which ye saw, learn ye and understand concerning the great convulsion2973 which took
place at that time, when He was crucified whose Gospel has winged its way through all the
earth by the signs which His disciples my fellows do in all the earth: yea, those who were
Hebrews, and knew only the language of the Hebrews, in which they were born, lo! at this
day are speaking in all languages, in order that those who are afar off may hear and believe,
even as those who are near. For He it is that confounded the tongues of the presumptuous
in this region who were before us; and He it is that teaches at this day the faith of truth and
verity by us, humble and despicable2974 men from Galilee of Palestine. For I also whom ye
see am from Paneas,2975 from the place where the river Jordan issues forth, and I was chosen,
together with my fellows, to be a preacher.</p>
<p>For, according as my Lord commanded me, lo! I preach and publish the Gospel, and
lo! His money do I cast upon the table before you, and the seed of His word do I sow in the
ears of all men; and such as are willing to receive it, theirs is the good recompense of the
confession of Christ; but those who are not persuaded, the dust of my feet do I shake off
against them, as He commanded me.</p>
<p>Repent therefore, my beloved, of evil ways and of abominable deeds, and turn yourselves
towards Him with a good and honest will, as He hath turned Himself towards you with the
favour of His rich mercies; and be ye not as the generations of former times that have passed
away, which, because they hardened their heart against the fear of God, received punishment
openly, that they themselves might be chastised, and that those who come after them may
tremble and be afraid. For the purpose of our Lord’s coming into the world assuredly
was,2976 that He might teach us and show us that at the consummation of the creation there
will be a resuscitation of all men, and that at that time their course of conduct will be portrayed
in their persons, and their bodies will be volumes for the writings of justice; nor will
any one be there who is unacquainted with books, because every one will read that which
is written in His own book.2977</p>

<p>Ye that have eyes, forasmuch as ye do not perceive, are yourselves also become like those

willing to perceive—not even that which ye see. For the dark cloud of error which overspreads
your minds suffers you not to obtain the heavenly light, which is the understanding

<p>Flee, then, from things made and created, as I said to you, which are only called gods

idols, nor is He a creature and a work of art, like those images in which ye glory. Because,
although this2982 Being put on a body, yet is He God with His Father. For the works of
creation, which trembled when He was slain and were dismayed at His suffering of
death,—these bear witness that He is Himself God the Creator. For it was not on account
of a man that the earth trembled,2983 but on account of Him who established the earth upon
the waters; nor was it on account of a man that the sun grew dark in the heavens, but on
account of Him who made the great lights; nor was it for a man that the just and righteous
were restored to life again, but for Him who had granted power over death from the beginning;
nor was it for a man that the veil of the temple of the Jews was rent from the top to
the bottom, but for Him who said to them, “Lo, your house is left desolate.” For, lo! unless
those who crucified Him had known that He was the Son of God, they would not have had
to proclaim2984 the desolation2985 of their city, nor would they have brought down Woe!

upon themselves.2986 For, even if they had wished to make light of this confession,2987 the
fearful convulsions which took place at that time would not have suffered them to do so.
For lo! some even of the children of the crucifiers are become at this day preachers and
evangelists, along with my fellow-apostles, in all the land of Palestine, and among the
Samaritans, and in all the country of the Philistines. The idols also of paganism are despised,
and the cross of Christ is honoured, and all nations and creatures confess God who became
man.</p>
<p>If, therefore, while Jesus our Lord was on earth ye would have believed in Him that He
is the Son of God, and before ye had heard the word of His preaching would have confessed
Him that He is God; now that He is ascended to His Father, and ye have seen the signs and
the wonders which are done in His name, and have heard with your own ears the word of
His Gospel, let no one of you doubt in his mind—so that the promise of His blessing which
He sent to you may be fulfilled2988 towards you: Blessed are ye that have believed in me,
not having seen me; and, because ye have so believed in me, the town2989 in which ye dwell
shall be blessed, and the enemy shall not prevail against it for ever.2990 Turn not away,

Syriac writers. Nor was it confined to the East: it obtained in very early times in our own country, where the
letter of our Lord to Abgar was regarded as a charm. In a very ancient service-book of the Saxon times, preserved

epistolam secum habuerit, securus ambulet in pace.” Jeremiah Jones, writing of the last century, says: “The
common people in England have had it in their houses in many places in a frame with a picture before it: and
they generally, with much honesty and devotion, regard it as the word of God and the genuine epistle of Christ.”
Even now a similar practice is believed to linger in some districts. The story of Abgar is told in an Anglo-Saxon
poem, published in Abgarus-Legenden paa Old-Engelsk by G. Stephens, Copenhagen, 1853. It consists of 204
lines, is a tolerable close rendering of Eusebius, and is ascribed by Stephens to Aelfric, archbishop of York from
1023 to 1052. Note that ambulet (above) is for ambulabit, apparently.—Tr.</note>

therefore, from his faith: for, lo! ye have heard and seen what things bear witness to His
faith—showing that He is the adorable Son, and is the glorious God, and is the victorious
King, and is the mighty Power; and through faith in Him a man is able to acquire the eyes
of a true mind,2991 and to understand that, whosoever worshippeth creatures, the wrath of
justice will overtake him.</p>
<p>For in everything which we speak before you, according as we have received of the gift
of our Lord, so speak we and teach and declare it, that ye may secure2992 your salvation and
not destroy2993 your spirits through the error of paganism: because the heavenly light has
arisen on the creation, and He it is who chose the fathers of former times, and the righteous
men, and the prophets, and spoke with them in the revelation of the Holy Spirit.2994 For
He is Himself the God of the Jews who crucified Him; and to Him it is that the erring pagans
offer worship, even while they know it not: because there is no other God in heaven and
on earth; and lo! confession ascendeth up to Him from the four quarters of the creation.
Lo! therefore, your ears have heard that which was not heard by you; and lo! further, your
eyes have seen that which was never seen by you.2995</p>
<p>Be not, therefore, gainsayers of that which ye have seen and heard. Put away from you
the rebellious mind of your fathers, and free yourselves from the yoke of sin, which hath
dominion over you in libations and in sacrifices offered before carved images; and be ye
concerned for your endangered2996 salvation, and for the unavailing support on which ye
lean;2997 and get you a new mind, that worships the Maker and not the things which are
made—a mind in which is portrayed the image of verity and of truth, of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; believing and being baptized in the triple and glorious names.
For this is our teaching and our preaching. For the belief of the truth of Christ does not
consist of many things.2998 And those of you as are willing to be obedient to Christ are

door of your ears the sayings of my lips, in which are portrayed the coming of Christ which
has already been, and also that which is yet to be; and the resurrection, and the resuscitation
of all men, and the separation which is to be made between the faithful and the unbelieving;
and the sore punishment which is reserved for those who know not God, and the blessed

Him and His exalted Father, and have confessed Him and His divine Spirit.2999</p>
<p>And now it is meet for us that I conclude my present discourse; and let those who have

And Addæus the apostle was rejoiced to see that a great number of the population of
the city stayed with him; and they were but few who did not remain at that time, while even
those few not many days after accepted his words and believed in the Gospel set forth in3000
the preaching of Christ.</p>
<p>And when Addæus the apostle had spoken these things before all the town of Edessa,
and King Abgar saw that all the city rejoiced in his teaching, men and women alike, and
heard them saying to him, “True and faithful is Christ who sent thee to us”—he himself also
rejoiced greatly at this, giving praise to God; because, like as he had heard from Hanan,3001
his Tabularius, about Christ, so had he seen the wonderful mighty-works which Addæus
the apostle did in the name of Christ.</p>
<p>And Abgar the king also said to him: According as I sent to Christ in my letter to Him,
and according as He also sent to me, so have I also received from thine own self this day; so
will I believe all the days of my life, and in the selfsame things will I continue and make my
boast, because I know also that there is no other power in whose name these signs and
wonders are done but the power of Christ whom thou preachest in verity and in truth. And

henceforth Him will I worship—I and my son Maanu,3002 and Augustin,3003 and Shalmath
the queen. And now, wherever thou desirest, build a church, a place of meeting for those
who have believed and shall believe in thy words; and, according to the command given
thee by thy Lord, minister thou at the seasons with confidence; to those also who shall be
with thee as teachers of this Gospel I am prepared to give large donations, in order that they
may not have any other work beside the ministry; and whatsoever is required by thee for
the expenses of the building I myself will give thee without any restriction,3004 whilst thy
word shall be authoritative and sovereign in this town; moreover, without the intervention
of any other person do thou come into my presence as one in authority, into the palace of
my royal majesty.</p>
<p>And when Abgar was gone down to his royal palace he rejoiced, he and his princes with
him, Abdu son of Abdu, and Garmai, and Shemashgram,3005 and Abubai, and Meherdath,
3006 together with the others their companions, at all that their eyes had seen and their
ears also had heard; and in the gladness of their heart they too began to praise God for
having turned their mind towards Him, renouncing the paganism in which they had lived,3007
and confessing the Gospel of Christ. And when Addæus had built a church they proceeded
to offer in it vows and oblations, they and the people of the city; and there they continued
to present their praises all the days of their life.</p>
<p>And Avida and Barcalba,3008 who were chief men and rulers, and wore the royal head-
band,3009 drew near to Addæus, and asked him about the matter of Christ, requesting that
he would tell them how He, though He was God, appeared to them as a man: And how,
said they, were ye able to look upon Him? And he proceeded to satisfy them all about this,

Moreover, everything that the prophets had spoken concerning Him he repeated before
them, and they received his words gladly and with faith, and there was not a man that
withstood him; for the glorious deeds which he did suffered not any man to withstand him.</p>
<p>Shavida, moreover, and Ebednebu, chiefs of the priests of this town, together with
Piroz3010 and Dilsu their companions, when they had seen the signs which he did, ran and
threw down the altars on which they were accustomed to sacrifice before Nebu and Bel,3011
their gods, except the great altar which was in the middle of the town; and they cried out
and said: Verily this is the disciple of that eminent and glorious Master, concerning whom
we have heard all that He did in the country of Palestine. And all those who believed in
Christ did Addæus receive, and baptized them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. And those who used to worship stones and stocks sat at his feet, recovered
from the madness3012 of paganism wherewith they had been afflicted. Jews also,
traders in fine raiment,3013 who were familiar with the law and the prophets—they too were
persuaded, and became disciples, and confessed Christ that He is the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>But neither did King Abgar nor yet the Apostle Addæus compel any man by force to
believe in Christ, because without the force of man the force of the signs compelled many
to believe in Him. And with affection did they receive His doctrine—all this country of
Mesopotamia, and all the regions round about it.</p>
<p>Aggæus, moreover, who3014 made the silks3015 and headbands of the king, and Palut,
and Barshelama, and Barsamya, together with the others their companions, clave to Addæus

with figures and devices upon them, as was the case with that worn by Sharbil. See Acts of Sharbil, sub init.”

the apostle; and he received them, and associated them with him in the ministry, their
business being to read in the Old Testament and the New,3016 and in the prophets, and in
the Acts of the Apostles, and to meditate upon them daily; strictly charging them to let their
bodies be pure and their persons holy, as is becoming in men who stand before the altar of
God. “And be ye,” said he, “far removed from false swearing and from wicked homicide,
and from dishonest testimony, which is connected with adultery; and from magic arts, for
which there is no mercy, and from sooth-saying, and divination, and fortune-tellers; and
from fate and nativities, of which the deluded Chaldeans make their boast; and from the
stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, in which the foolish put their trust. And put far from you
unjust partiality, and bribes, and presents, through which the innocent are pronounced
guilty. And along with this ministry, to which ye have been called, see that ye have no other
work besides: for the Lord is the work of your ministry all the days of your life. And be ye
diligent to give the seal of baptism. And be not fond of the gains of this world. And hear
ye a cause with justice and with truth. And be ye not a stumbling-block to the blind, lest
through you should be blasphemed the name of Him who opened the eyes of the blind, according
as we have seen. Let all, therefore, who see you perceive that ye yourselves are in

<p>And they ministered with him in the church which Addæus had built at the word and
command of Abgar the king, being furnished with supplies by the king and his nobles, partly
for the house of God, and partly for the supply of the poor. Moreover, much people day by
day assembled and came to the prayers of the service, and to the reading of the Old Testament,
and the New of the Diatessaron.3017 They also believed in the restoration of the dead, and
buried their departed in the hope of resuscitation. The festivals of the Church they also
observed in their seasons, and were assiduous every day in the vigils of the Church. And
they made visits of almsgiving, to the sick and to those that were whole, according to the
instruction of Addæus to them. In the environs, too, of the city churches were built, and
many received from him ordination to the priesthood.3018 So that even people of the East,

Acts of the Apostles is meant the work of Luke, this passage seems to show that the compiler of this account of
Addæus wrote some years subsequently to the events which he relates, or that it has been added by a later interpolator.
For at the earlier period of Addæus’ ministry no other part of the New Testament was written than the
Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, which is probably the Gospel here meant.</note>
<note type="footnote">3017 Or “Ditornon.” The reading of the ms. is not clear. It seems that it ought to be Diatessaron, which Tatian
has the Syrian compiled from the four Gospels about the middle of the second century. This was in general use
at Edessa up to the fourth century, and Ephraem Syrus wrote a commentary on it. If this be so, we have here a
later interpolation. [The translator says (of Ditornon and Diatess.): “The two words would differ but slightly
in the mode of writing.” He also corrects Cureton, who calls Tatian “the Syrian:” it should be “the Assyrian.”]</note>

in the guise of merchants, passed over into the territory of the Romans, that they might see
the signs which Addæus did. And such as became disciples received from him ordination
to the priesthood, and in their own country of the Assyrians they instructed the people of
their nation, and erected houses of prayer there in secret, by reason of the danger from those
who worshipped fire and paid reverence to water.3019</p>
<p>Moreover, Narses, the king of the Assyrians, when he heard of those same things which
Addæus the apostle had done, sent a message to Abgar the king: Either despatch to me the
man who doeth these signs before thee, that I may see him and hear his word, or send me
an account of all that thou hast seen him do in thy own town. And Abgar wrote to Narses,3020
and related to him the whole story of the deeds of Addæus from the beginning to the end;
and he left nothing which he did not write to him. And, when Narses heard those things
which were written to him, he was astonished and amazed.</p>
<p>Abgar the king, moreover, because he was not able to pass over into the territory of the
Romans,3021 and go to Palestine and slay the Jews for having crucified Christ, wrote a letter
and sent it to Tiberius Cæsar,3022 writing in it thus:—</p>
<p>King Abgar to our Lord Tiberius Cæsar: Although I know that nothing is hidden from
thy Majesty, I write to inform thy dread and mighty Sovereignty that the Jews who are under
thy dominion and dwell in the country of Palestine have assembled themselves together
and crucified Christ, without any fault worthy of death, after He had done before them signs
and wonders, and had shown them powerful mighty-works, so that He even raised the dead
to life for them; and at the time that they crucified Him the sun became darkened and the
earth also quaked, and all created things trembled and quaked, and, as if of themselves, at
this deed the whole creation and the inhabitants of the creation shrank away. And now thy
Majesty knoweth what it is meet for thee to command concerning the people of the Jews
who have done these things.</p>
<p>And Tiberius Cæsar wrote and sent to King Abgar; and thus did he write to him:—</p>
<p>The letter of thy Fidelity towards me I have received, and it hath been read before me.

also has written and informed Aulbinus3024 my proconsul concerning these selfsame things
of which thou hast written to me. But, because a war with the people of Spain,3025 who
have rebelled against me, is on foot at this time, on this account I have not been able to
avenge this matter; but I am prepared, when I shall have leisure, to issue a command according
to law against the Jews, who act not according to law. And on this account, as regards
Pilate also, who was appointed by me governor there—I have sent another in his stead, and
dismissed him in disgrace, because he departed from the law,3026 and did the will of the
Jews, and for the gratification of the Jews crucified Christ, who, according to what I hear
concerning Him, instead of suffering the cross of death, deserved to be honoured and worshipped3027
by them: and more especially because with their own eyes they saw everything
that He did. Yet thou, in accordance with thy fidelity towards me, and the faithful covenant
entered into by thyself and by thy fathers, hast done well in writing to me thus.</p>
<p>And Abgar the king received Aristides, who had been sent by Tiberius Cæsar to him;
and in reply he sent him back with presents of honour suitable for him who had sent him
to him. And from Edessa he went to Thicuntha,3028 where Claudius, the second from the
emperor, was; and from thence, again, he went to Artica,3029 where Tiberius Cæsar was:
Caius, moreover, was guarding the regions round about Cæsar. And Aristides himself also
<note type="footnote">3024 The word is evidently misspelt. The name intended may have been confounded with that of the Albinus

river Euphrates the governor Sabinus had authority.” The person meant can only be Vitellius, who was then
governor of Syria, who removed Pilate from the administration of Judea, sending Marcellus in his stead, and
ordered him to appear before Tiberius at Rome. The emperor died before he reached Rome.</note>
<note type="footnote">3025 No mention is made by historians of any war with Spain. But about this time Vitellius, mentioned in
the preceding note, was mixed up with the wars of the Parthians and Hiberians; and, as Hiberi is a name common

Syriac.</note>

related before Tiberius concerning the mighty-works which Addæus had done before Abgar
the king. And when he had leisure from the war he sent and put to death some of the chief
men of the Jews who were in Palestine. And, when Abgar the king heard of this, he rejoiced
greatly that the Jews had received punishment, as it was right.</p>
<p>And some years after Addæus the apostle had built the church in Edessa, and had furnished
it with everything that was suitable for it, and had made disciples of a great number
of the population of the city, he further built churches in the villages3030 also—both those
which were at a distance and those which were near, and finished and adorned them, and
appointed in them deacons and elders, and instructed in them those who should read the
Scriptures, and taught the ordinances and3031 the ministry without and within.</p>
<p>After all these things he fell ill of the sickness of which he departed from this world.
And he called for Aggæus before the whole assembly of the church, and bade him draw
near, and made him Guide and Ruler3032 in his stead. And Palut,3033 who was a deacon,
he made elder; and Abshelama, who was a scribe, he made deacon. And, the nobles and
chief men being assembled, and standing near him—Barcalba son of Zati,3034 and Maryhab3035
son of Barshemash, and Senac3036 son of Avida, and Piroz son of Patric,3037 together
with the rest of their companions—Addæus the apostle said to them:—</p>

of including two or more distinguished nations under a class to which only one of them belongs was not unknown
among classical writers also: as when, e.g., Thucydides speaks of the Peloponnesian war as the most remarkable
of all the wars that preceded it. Milton’s imitation, “The fairest of her daughters, Eve” [Paradise Lost, iv. 324],

about a.d. 105–112, where Barsamya is called “the Bishop of the Christians,” although he is more generally
designated as here. It is also found in the Teaching Simon Cephas, sub fin., which seems to have been written
early in the second century or at the end of the first. The passage in the Teaching of Addæus, p. 665, infra, where

paths. Seek ye those that are lost, and direct those that go astray, and rejoice in those that
are found; bind up the bruised, and watch over the fatlings: because at your hands will the
sheep of Christ be required. Look ye not for the honour that passeth away: for the shepherd
that looketh to receive honour from his flock—sadly, sadly stands his flock with respect to
him. Let your concern be great for the young lambs, whose angels behold the face of the
Father who is unseen. And be ye not stones of stumbling before the blind, but clearers of
the way and the paths in a rugged country, among the Jews the crucifiers, and the deluded
pagans: for with these two parties have ye to fight, in order that ye may show the truth of
the faith which ye hold; and, though ye be silent, your modest and decorous appearance
will fight for you against those who hate truth and love falsehood.</p>

<p>“Be not beguiled by the hateful devices of Satan, lest ye be stripped naked of the faith
which ye have put on.”3041…“And with the Jews, the crucifiers, we will have no fellowship.
And this inheritance which we have received from thee we will not let go, but in that will
we depart out of this world; and on the day of our Lord, before the judgment-seat of His
righteousness, there will He restore to us this inheritance, even as thou hast told us.”</p>
<p>And, when these things had been spoken, Abgar the king rose up, he and his chief men
and his nobles, and he went to his palace, all of them being distressed for him because he
was dying. And he sent to him noble and excellent apparel, that he might be buried in it.
And, when Addæus saw it, he sent to him, saying: In my lifetime I have not taken anything
from thee, nor will I now at my death take anything from thee, nor will I frustrate the word
of Christ which He spake to us: Accept not anything from any man, and possess not anything
in this world.3042</p>
<p>And three days more after these things had been spoken by Addæus the apostle, and
he had heard and received the testimony concerning the teaching set forth in their preaching
from those engaged with him in the ministry, in the presence of all the nobles he departed
out of this world. And that day was the fifth of the week, and the fourteenth of the month
Iyar,3043 nearly answering to May. And the whole city was in great mourning and bitter
anguish for him. Nor was it the Christians only that were distressed for him, but the Jews
also, and the pagans, who were in this same town. But Abgar the king was distressed for
him more than any one, he and the princes of his kingdom. And in the sadness of his soul
he despised and laid aside the magnificence of his kingly state on that day, and with tears
mingled with moans he bewailed him with all men. And all the people of the city that saw
him were amazed to see how greatly he suffered on his account. And with great and surpassing
pomp he bore him, and buried him like one of the princes when he dies; and he laid him
in a grand sepulchre adorned with sculpture wrought by the fingers—that in which were
laid those of the house of Ariu, the ancestors of Abgar the king: there he laid him sorrowfully,
with sadness and great distress. And all the people of the church went there from time to
time and prayed fervently; and they kept up the remembrance of his departure from year
to year, according to the command and direction which had been received by them from
Addæus the apostle,3044 and according to the word of Aggæus, who himself became Guide

and Ruler, and the successor of his seat after him, by the ordination to the priesthood which
he had received from him in the presence of all men.</p>
<p>He too, with the same ordination which he had received from him, made Priests and
Guides in the whole of this country of Mesopotamia. For they also, in like manner as Addæus
the apostle, held fast his word, and listened to and received it, as good and faithful successors
of the apostle of the adorable Christ. But silver and gold he took not from any man, nor
did the gifts of the princes come near him: for, instead of receiving gold and silver, he himself
enriched the Church of Christ with the souls of believers.</p>
<p>Moreover, as regards the entire state3045 of the men and the women, they were chaste
and circumspect, and holy and pure: for they lived like anchorites3046 and chastely, without
spot—in circumspect watchfulness touching the ministry, in their sympathy3047 toward the
poor, in their visitations to the sick: for their footsteps were fraught with praise from those
who saw them, and their conduct was arrayed in commendation from strangers—so that
even the priests of the house of3048 Nebu and Bel divided the honour with them at all times,
by reason of their dignified aspect, their truthful words, their frankness of speech arising
from their noble nature, which was neither subservient through covetousness nor in bondage
under the fear of blame. For there was no one who saw them that did not run to meet them,
that he might salute them respectfully, because the very sight of them shed peace upon the
beholden: for just like a net3049 were their words of gentleness spread over the contumacious,
and they entered within the fold of truth and verity. For there was no man who saw them
that was ashamed of them, because they did nothing that was not accordant with rectitude
and propriety. And in consequence of these things their bearing was fearless as they published
their teaching to all men. For, whatsoever they said to others and enjoined on them,
they themselves exhibited in practice in their own persons; and the hearers, who saw that
their actions went along with their words, without much persuasion became their disciples,
and confessed the King Christ, praising God for having turned them towards Him.</p>
<p>And some years after the death of Abgar the king, there arose one of his contumacious3050
sons, who was not favourable to peace; and he sent word to Aggæus, as he was

sitting in the church: Make me a headband of gold, such as thou usedst to make for my
fathers in former times. Aggæus sent to him: I will not give up the ministry of Christ, which
was committed to me by the disciple of Christ, and make a headband of wickedness. And,
when he saw that he did not comply, he sent and brake his legs3051 as he was sitting in the
church expounding. And as he was dying he adjured Palut and Abshelama: In this house,
for whose truth’s sake, lo! I am dying, lay me and bury me. And, even as he had adjured
them, so did they lay him—inside the middle door of the church, between the men and the
women. And there was great and bitter mourning in all the church, and in all the city—over
and above the anguish and the mourning which there had been within the church, such as
had been the mourning when Addæus the apostle himself died.</p>
<p>And,3052 in consequence of his dying suddenly and quickly at the breaking of his legs,
he was not able to lay his hand upon Palut. Palut went to Antioch, and received ordination
to the priesthood from Serapion bishop of Antioch; by which Serapion himself also ordination
had been received from Zephyrinus bishop of the city of Rome, in the succession of the ordination
to the priesthood from Simon Cephas, who had received it from our Lord, and
was bishop there in Rome twenty-five years in the days of the Cæsar who reigned there
thirteen years.</p>
<p>And, according to the custom which exists in the kingdom of Abgar the king, and in all
kingdoms, that whatsoever the king commands and whatsoever is spoken in his presence
is committed to writing and deposited among the records, so also did Labubna,3053 son of

before the death of Abgar, who died a.d. 45; whereas Serapion did not become bishop of Antioch till the beginning
of the third century, if, as is here stated, he was consecrated by Zephyrinus, who did not become Bishop of Rome
till a.d. 201.</note>

Syriac. Dr. Alishan, in a letter to Dr. Cureton from the Armenian Convent of St. Lazarus, Venice, says he has
found an Armenianms., of probably the twelfth century, which he believes to be a translation of the present
Syriac original. It is a history of Abgad and Thaddæus, written by Ghérubnia with the assistance of Ananias (=

sellers are kept with care, without any negligence whatever.</p>

<head>Syriac Calendar.</head>
<p>A Note by the Translator.—The following list of the Syrian names of months, in use in
the empire and during the era of the Seleucidæ, several of which have been mentioned in
these Documents, is taken from Caswinii Calendarium Syriacum, edited in Arabic and
Latin by Volck, 1859. The later Hebrew names also are here added for comparison. It must,
however, be noticed that “the years employed in the Syrian Calendar, were, at least after the
incarnation, Julian years, composed of Roman months.” (SeeL’Art de vérifier les dates:
Paris, 1818, tom. i. p. 45.) The correspondence with the Hebrew months, therefore, is not
so close as the names would indicate, since these commenced with the new moons, and an
intercalary month, Veadar, following their twelfth month Adar, was added.</p>

<head>The Teaching of the Apostles.3054</head>
<p>At that time Christ was taken up to His Father; and how the apostles received the gift
of the Spirit; and the Ordinances and Laws of the Church; and whither each one of the
apostles went; and from whence the countries in the territory of the Romans received the
ordination to the priesthood.</p>
<p>In the year three hundred and3055 thirty-nine of the kingdom of the Greeks, in the
month Heziran,3056 on the fourth3057 day of the same, which is the first day of the week,
and the end of Pentecost3058—on the selfsame day came the disciples from Nazareth of
Galilee, where the conception of our Lord was announced, to the mount which is called that
of the Place of Olives,3059 our Lord being with them, but not being visible to them. And at
the time of early dawn our Lord lifted up His hands, and laid them upon the heads of the
eleven disciples, and gave to them the gift of the priesthood. And suddenly a bright cloud
received Him. And they saw Him as He was going up to heaven. And He sat down on the
right hand of His Father. And they praised God because they saw His ascension according
as He had told them; and they rejoiced because they had received the Right Hand conferring
on them the priesthood of the house of Moses and Aaron.
And from thence they went up to the city, and3060 proceeded to an upper room—that
in which our Lord had observed the passover with them, and the place where the inquiries

had been made: Who it was that should betray our Lord to the crucifiers? There also were
made the inquiries:3061 How they should preach His Gospel in the world? And, as within
the upper room the mystery of the body and of the blood of our Lord began to prevail in
the world, so also from thence did the teaching of His preaching begin to have authority in
the world.</p>
<p>And, when the disciples were cast into this perplexity, how they should preach His
Gospel to men of strange tongues3062 which were unknown to them, and were speaking
thus to one another: Although we are confident that Christ will perform by our hands
mighty works and miracles in the presence of strange peoples whose tongues we know not,
and who themselves also are unversed in our tongue, yet who shall teach them and make
them understand that it is by the name of Christ who was crucified that these mighty works
and miracles are done?—while, I say, the disciples were occupied with these thoughts, Simon
Cephas rose up, and said to them: My brethren, this matter, how we shall preach His Gospel,
pertaineth not to us, but to our Lord; for He knoweth how it is possible for us to preach His
Gospel in the world; and we rely on His care for us, which He promised us, saying: “When
I am ascended to my Father I will send you the Spirit, the Paraclete, that He may teach you
everything which it is meet for you to know, and to make known.”</p>
<p>And, whilst Simon Cephas was saying these things to his fellow-apostles, and putting
them in remembrance, a mysterious voice was heard by them, and a sweet odour, which
was strange to the world, breathed upon them;3063 and tongues of fire, between the voice
and the odour, came down from heaven3064 towards them, and alighted and sat on every
one of them; and, according to the tongue which every one of them had severally received,
so did he prepare himself to go to the country in which that tongue was spoken and heard.</p>
<p>And, by the same gift of the Spirit which was given to them on that day, they appointed
Ordinances and Laws—such as were in accordance with the Gospel of their preaching, and
with the true and faithful doctrine of their teaching:—</p>
<p>1. The apostles therefore appointed: Pray ye towards the east:3065 because, “as the
lightning which lighteneth from the east and is seen even to the west, so shall the coming

of the Son of man be:”3066 that by this we might know and understand that He will appear
from the east suddenly.3067</p>
<p>2. The apostles further appointed: On the first day of the week let there be service, and
the reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the oblation:3068 because on the first day of the
week our Lord rose from the place of the dead and on the first day of the week He arose
upon the world, and on the first day of the week He ascended up to heaven, and on the first
day of the week He will appear at last with the angels of heaven.3069</p>
<p>3. The apostles further appointed: On the fourth3070 day of the week let there be service:
because on that day our Lord made the disclosure to them about His trial,3071 and His suffering,
and His crucifixion, and His death, and His resurrection; and the disciples were on
account of this in sorrow.3072</p>
<p>4. The apostles further appointed: On the eve of the Sabbath,3073 at the ninth hour, let
there be service: because that which had been spoken on the fourth day of the week about
the suffering of the Saviour was brought to pass on the same eve; the worlds and creatures
trembling, and the luminaries in the heavens being darkened.</p>
<p>5. The apostles further appointed: Let there be elders and deacons, like the Levites;3074
and subdeacons,3075 like those who carried the vessels of the court of the sanctuary of the
Lord; and an overseer,3076 who shall likewise be the Guide of all the people,3077 like Aaron,
the head and chief of all the priests and Levites of the whole city.3078</p>

which is the chief of the festivals of the Church, on the sixth day of the latter Canun,3080 in
the long number of the Greeks.3081</p>
<p>7. The apostles further appointed: Forty3082 days before the day of the passion of our
Saviour fast ye, and then celebrate the day of the passion, and the day of the resurrection:
because our Lord Himself also, the Lord of the festival, fasted forty days; and Moses and
Elijah, who were endued with this mystery, likewise each fasted forty days, and then were
glorified.</p>
<p>8. The apostles further appointed: At the conclusion of all the Scriptures other let the
Gospel be read, as being the seal3083 of all the Scriptures; and let the people listen to it
standing upon their feet: because it is the Gospel of the redemption of all men.</p>
<p>9. The apostles further appointed: At the completion of fifty3084 days after His resurrection
make ye a commemoration of His ascension to His glorious Father.</p>

Gospel, and the Acts (of their exploits), nothing should be read on the pulpit in the
church.3085</p>

Church and the ordinances and laws which are appointed in it, let him not be a guide and
ruler; and whosoever is acquainted with them and departs from them, let him not minister
again: because, not being true in his ministry, he has lied.</p>
<p>12. The apostles further appointed: Whosoever sweareth, or3086 lieth, or beareth false
witness, or hath recourse to magicians and soothsayers and Chaldeans, and putteth confidence
in fates and nativities, which they hold fast who know not God,—let him also, as a man
that knoweth not God, be dismissed from the ministry, and not minister again.</p>

the ministry, and who follows it not with a steadfast will3087, let not this man minister again:

is occupied in merchandise and covetousness, let not this man minister again, nor continue
in the ministry.</p>
<p>15. The apostles further appointed: That whosoever loveth the Jews,3090 like Iscariot,
who was their friend, or the pagans, who worship creatures instead of the Creator,—should
not enter in amongst them and minister; and moreover, that if he be already amongst them,
they should not suffer him to remain, but that he should be separated from amongst them,
and not minister with them again.</p>
<p>16. The apostles further appointed: That, if any one from the Jews or from the pagans
come and join himself with them, and if after he has joined himself with them he turn and
go back again to the side on which he stood before, and if he again return and come to them
a second time,—he should not be received again; but that, according to the side on which
he was before, so those who know him should look upon him.
17. The apostles further appointed: That it should not be permitted to the Guide to
transact the matters which pertain to the Church apart from those who minister with him;
but that he should issue commands with the counsel of them all, and that that only should
be done which all of them should concur in and not disapprove.3091</p>
<p>18. The apostles further appointed: Whenever any shall depart out of this world with
a good testimony to the faith of Christ, and with affliction borne for His name’s sake, make
ye a commemoration of them on the day on which they were put to death.3092</p>
<p>19. The apostles further appointed: In the service of the Church repeat ye the praises
of David day by day: because of this saying: “I will bless the Lord at all times, and at all

<p>20. The apostles further appointed: If any divest themselves of mammon and run not
after the gain of money, let these men be chosen and admitted to the ministry of the altar.</p>
<p>21. The apostles further appointed: Let any priest who accidentally puts another in
bonds3094 contrary to justice receive the punishment that is right; and let him that has been
bound receive the bonds as if he had been equitably bound.</p>
<p>22. The apostles further appointed: If it be seen that those who are accustomed to hear
causes show partiality, and pronounce the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent, let them
never again hear another cause: thus receiving the rebuke of their partiality, as it is fit.3095</p>
<p>23. The apostles further ordained: Let not those that are high-minded and lifted up
with the arrogance of boasting be admitted to the ministry: because of this text: “That
which is exalted among men is abominable before God;” and because concerning them it
is said: “I will return a recompense upon those that vaunt themselves.”</p>
<p>24. The apostles further appointed: Let there be a Ruler over the elders who are in the
villages, and let him be recognised as head of them all, at whose hand all of them shall be
required: for Samuel also thus made visits from place to place and ruled.3096</p>
<p>25. The apostles further appointed: That those kings who shall hereafter believe in
Christ should be permitted to go up and stand before the altar along with the Guides of the
Church: because David also, and those who were like him, went up and stood before the
altar.3097</p>
<p>26. The apostles further appointed: Let no man dare to do anything by the authority
of the priesthood which is not in accordance with justice and equity, but in accordance with
justice, and free from the blame of partiality, let all things be done.</p>
<p>27. The apostles further appointed: Let the bread of the Oblation be placed upon the
altar on the day on which it is baked, and not some days after—a thing which is not permitted.</p>
<p>All these things did the apostles appoint, not for themselves, but for those who should
come after them—for they were apprehensive that in time to come wolves would put on
sheep’s clothing: since for themselves the Spirit, the Paraclete, which was in them, was sufficient:
that, even as He had appointed these laws by their hands, so He would guide them
lawfully. For they, who had received from our Lord power and authority, had no need that
laws should be appointed for them by others. For Paul also, and Timothy,3098 while they

were going from place to place in the country of Syria and Cilicia, committed these same
Commands and Laws of the apostles and elders to those who were under the hand of the
apostles, for the churches of the countries in which they were preaching and publishing the
Gospel.</p>
<p>The disciples, moreover, after they had appointed these Ordinances and Laws, ceased
not from the preaching of the Gospel, or from the wonderful mighty-works which our Lord
did by their hands. For much people was gathered about them every day, who believed in
Christ; and they came to them from other cities, and heard their words and received them.
Nicodemus also, and Gamaliel, chiefs of the synagogue of the Jews, used to come to the
apostles in secret, agreeing with their teaching. Judas, moreover, and Levi, and Peri, and
Joseph, and Justus, sons of Hananias, and Caiaphas3099 and Alexander the priests—they
too used to come to the apostles by night, confessing Christ that He is the Son of God; but
they were afraid of the people of their own nation, so that they did not disclose their mind
toward the disciples.</p>
<p>And the apostles received them affectionately, saying to them: Do not, by reason of the
shame and fear of men, forfeit your salvation before God, nor have the blood of Christ required
of you; even as your fathers, who took it upon them: for it is not acceptable before
God, that, while ye are, in secret, with His worshippers, ye should go and associate with the
murderers of His adorable Son. How do ye expect that your faith should be accepted with
those that are true, whilst ye are with those that are false? But it becomes you, as men who
believe in Christ, to confess openly this faith which we preach.3100</p>
<p>And, when they heard these things from the Disciples, those sons of the priests, all of
them alike, cried out before the whole company of the apostles: We confess and believe in
Christ who was crucified, and we confess that He is from everlasting the Son of God; and
those who dared to crucify Him do we renounce. For even the priests of the people in secret
confess Christ; but, for the sake of the headship among the people which they love, they are
not willing to confess openly; and they have forgotten that which is written:3101 “Of
knowledge is He the Lord, and before Him avail not crafty devices.”</p>
<p>And, when their fathers heard these things from their sons, they became exceedingly
hostile to them: not indeed because they had believed in Christ, but because they had declared
and spoken openly of the mind of their fathers before the sons of their people.</p>

<p>But those who believed clove to the disciples, and departed not from them, because they
saw that, whatsoever they taught the multitude, they themselves carried into practice before
all men; and, when affliction and persecution arose against the disciples, they rejoiced to be
afflicted with them, and received with gladness stripes and imprisonment for the confession
of their faith in Christ; and all the days of their life they preached Christ before the Jews and
the Samaritans.</p>
<p>And after the death of the apostles there were Guides and Rulers3102 in the churches;
and, whatsoever the apostles had committed to them and they had received from them, they
continued to teach to the multitude through the whole space of their lives. They too, again,
at their deaths committed and delivered to their disciples after them whatsoever they had
received from the apostles; also what James had written from Jerusalem, and Simon from
the city of Rome, and John from Ephesus, and Mark from Alexandria the Great, and Andrew
from Phrygia, and Luke from Macedonia, and Judas Thomas from India:3103 that the epistles
of an apostle3104 might be received and read in the churches that were in every place, just
as the achievements of their Acts, which Luke wrote, are read; that hereby the apostles might
be known, and the prophets, and the Old Testament and the New;3105 that so might be seen
one truth was proclaimed in them all: that one Spirit spoke in them all, from one God whom
they had all worshipped and had all preached. And the divers countries received their
teaching. Everything, therefore, which had been spoken by our Lord by means of the apos
tles, and which the apostles had delivered to their disciples, was believed and received in
every country, by the operation3106 of our Lord, who said to them: “I am with you, even
until the world shall end;” the Guides disputing with the Jews from the books of the
prophets, and contending also against the deluded pagans with the terrible mighty-works
which they did in the name of Christ. For all the peoples, even those that dwell in other
countries, quietly and silently received3107 the Gospel of Christ; and those who became

confessors cried out under their persecution: This our persecution to-day shall plead3108
on our behalf, lest we be punished, for having been formerly persecutors ourselves. For there
were some of them against whom death by the sword was ordered; and there were some of
them from whom they took away whatsoever they possessed, and let them go.3109 And the
more affliction arose against them, the richer and larger did their congregations become;
and with gladness in their hearts did they receive death of every kind. And by ordination
to the priesthood, which the apostles themselves had received from our Lord, did their
Gospel wing its way rapidly into the four quarters of the world. And by mutual visitation
they ministered to one another.</p>

and the parts occupied by the Samaritans, and the parts occupied by the Philistines, and the

thence to Rome on account of Simon the sorcerer, who was deluding the people of Rome
with his sorceries.3113</p>

<head>3125The Teaching of Simon Cephas3126 in the City of Rome.3127</head>
<p>In the third3128 year of Claudius Cæsar, Simon Cephas departed from Antioch to go to
Rome. And as he passed on he preached in the divers countries the word of our Lord. And,
when he had nearly arrived there,3129 many had heard of it and went out to meet him, and
the whole church received him with great joy. And some of the princes of the city, wearers
of the imperial headbands,3130 came to him, that they might see him and hear his word.
And, when the whole city was gathered together about him, he stood up to speak to them,
and to show them the preaching of his doctrine, of what sort it was. And he began to speak
to them thus:—</p>
<p>Men, people of Rome, saints of all Italy, hear ye that which I say to you. This day I
preach and proclaim Jesus the Son of God, who came down from heaven, and became man,
and was with us as one of ourselves, and wrought marvellous mighty-works and signs and
wonders before us, and before all the Jews that are in the land of Palestine. And you
yourselves also heard of those things which He did: because they came to Him from other
countries also, on account of the fame of His healing and the report of the marvellous help
He gave;3131 and whosoever drew near to Him was healed by His word. And, inasmuch as
He was God, at the same time that He healed He also forgave sins: for His healing, which
was open to view, bore witness of His hidden forgiveness, that it was real and trustworthy.
For this Jesus did the prophets announce in their mysterious sayings, as they were looking
forward to see Him and to hear His word: Him who was with His Father from eternity and
from everlasting; God, who was hidden in the height, and appeared in the depth; the glorious
Son, who was from His Progenitor, and is to be glorified, together with His Father, and His

divine Spirit, and the terrible power of His dominion. And He was crucified of His own
will by the hands of sinners, and was taken up to His Father, even as I and my companions
saw. And He is about to come again, in His own glory and that of His holy angels, even as
we heard Him say to us. For we cannot say anything which was not heard by us from Him,
neither do we write in the book of His Gospel anything which He Himself did not say to
us: because this word is spoken in order that the mouth of liars may be shut, in the day
when men shall give an account of idle words at the place of judgment.</p>
<p>Moreover, because we were catchers of fish,3132 and not skilled in books, therefore did
He also say to us: “I will send you the Spirit, the Paraclete, that He may teach you that which
ye know not;” for it is by His gift that we speak those things which ye hear. And, further,
by it we bring aid to the sick, and healing to the diseased: that by the hearing of His word
and by the aid of His power ye may believe in Christ, that He is God, the Son of God; and
may be delivered from the service of bondage, and may worship Him and His Father, and
glorify His divine Spirit. For when we glorify the Father, we glorify the Son also with Him;
and when we worship the Son, we worship the Father also with Him; and when we confess
the Spirit, we confess the Father also and the Son: because in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Spirit, were we commanded to baptize those who believe, that they
may live for ever.</p>
<p>Flee therefore from the words of the wisdom of this world, in which there is no profit,
and draw near to those which are true and faithful, and acceptable before God; whose reward
also is laid up in store, and whose recompense standeth sure. Now, too,3133 the light has
arisen on the creation, and the world has obtained the eyes of the mind, that every man may
see and understand that it is not fit that creatures should be worshipped instead of the
Creator, nor together with the Creator: because everything which is a creature is made to
be a worshipper of its Maker, and is not to be worshipped like its Creator. But this One who
came to us is God, the Son of God, in His own nature, notwithstanding that He mingled3134
His Godhead with our manhood, in order that He might renew our manhood by the aid of
His Godhead. And on this account it is right that we should worship Him, because He is
to be worshipped together with His Father, and that we should not worship creatures, who

were created for the worship of the Creator. For He is Himself the God of truth and verity;
He is Himself from before all worlds and creatures; He is Himself the veritable Son, and the
glorious fruit3135 which is from the exalted Father.</p>
<p>But ye see the wonderful works which accompany and follow these words. One would
not credit it: the time lo! is short since He ascended to His Father, and see how His Gospel
has winged its flight through the whole creation—that thereby it may be known and believed
that He Himself is the Creator of creatures, and that by His bidding creatures subsist. And,
whereas ye saw the sun become darkened at His death, ye yourselves also are witnesses.
The earth, moreover, quaked when He was slain, and the veil was rent at His death. And
concerning these things the governor Pilate also was witness: for he himself sent and made
them known to Cæsar,3136 and these things, and more than these, were read before him,
and before the princes of your city. And on this account Cæsar was angry against Pilate
because he had unjustly listened to the persuasion of the Jews; and for this reason he sent
and took away from him the authority which he had given to him. And this same thing was
published and known in all the dominion of the Romans. That, therefore, which Pilate saw
and made known to Cæsar and to your honourable senate, the same do I preach and declare,
as do also my fellow-apostles. And ye know that Pilate could not have written to the imperial
government of that which did not take place and which he had not seen with his own
eyes; but that which did take place and was actually done—this it was that he wrote and
made known. Moreover, the watchers of the sepulchre also were witnesses of those things
which took place there: they became as dead men; and, when those watchers were questioned
before Pilate, they confessed before him how large a bribe the chief-priests of the Jews had
given them, so that they might say that we His disciples had stolen the corpse of Christ. Lo!
then, ye have heard many things; and moreover, if ye be not willing to be persuaded by those
things which ye have heard, be at least persuaded by the mighty-works which ye see, which
are done by His name.</p>
<p>Let not Simon the sorcerer delude you by semblances which are not realities, which he

<p>And immediately they sent and fetched Simon the sorcerer;3137 and the men who were
adherents of his opinion said to him: As a man concerning whom we have confidence that
there is power in thee to do anything whatsoever,3138 do thou some sign before us all, and
let this Simon the Galilæan, who preaches Christ, see it. And, whilst they were thus speaking
to him, there happened to be passing along a dead person, a son of one of those who were
chiefs and men of note and renown among them. And all of them, as they were assembled
together, said to him: Whichever of you shall restore to life this dead person, he is true, and
to be believed in and received, and we will all follow him in whatsoever he saith to us. And
they said to Simon the sorcerer: Because thou wast here before Simon the Galilæan, and
we knew thee before him, exhibit thou first the power which accompanieth thee.3139</p>
<p>Then Simon reluctantly drew near to the dead person; and they set down the bier before
him; and he looked to the right hand and to the left, and gazed up into heaven, saying many
words: some of them he uttered aloud, and some of them secretly and not aloud. And he
delayed a long while, and nothing took place, and nothing was done, and the dead person
was lying upon his bier.</p>
<p>And forthwith Simon Cephas drew near boldly towards the dead man, and cried aloud
before all the assembly which was standing there: In the name of Jesus Christ, whom the
Jews crucified at Jerusalem, and whom we preach, rise up thence. And as soon as the word
of Simon was spoken the dead man came to life and rose up from the bier.</p>
<p>And all the people saw and marvelled; and they said to Simon: Christ, whom thou
preachest, is true. And many cried out, and said: Let Simon the sorcerer and the deceiver
of us all be stoned. But Simon, by reason that every one was running to see the dead man
that was come to life, escaped from them from one street to another and from house to
house, and fell not into their hands on that day.</p>
<p>But the whole city took hold of Simon Cephas, and they received him gladly and affectionately;
and he ceased not from doing signs and wonders in the name of Christ; and many
believed in him. Cuprinus,3140 moreover, the father of him that was restored to life, took
Simon with him to his house, and entertained him in a suitable manner, while he and all
his household believed in Christ, that He is the Son of the living God. And many of the
Jews and of the pagans became disciples there. And, when there was great rejoicing at his
teaching, he built churches there, in Rome and in the cities round about, and in all the villages

of the people of Italy; and he served there in the rank of the Superintendence of Rulers
twenty-five years.3141</p>
<p>And after these years Nero Cæsar seized him and shut him up in prison. And he knew
that he would crucify him; so he called Ansus,3142 the deacon, and made him bishop in his
stead in Rome. And these things did Simon himself speak; and moreover also the rest, the
other things which he had in charge, he commanded Ansus to teach before the people, saying
to him: Beside the New Testament and the Old let there not be read before the people3143
anything else:3144 which is not right.</p>
<p>And, when Cæsar had commanded that Simon should be crucified with his head
downwards, as he himself had requested of Cæsar, and that Paul’s head should be taken off,
there was great commotion among the people, and bitter distress in all the church, seeing
that they were deprived of the sight of the apostles. And Isus the guide arose and took up
their bodies by night, and buried them with great honour, and there came to be a gatheringplace
there for many.</p>
<p>And at that very time, as if by a righteous judgment, Nero abandoned his empire and
fled, and there was a cessation for a little while from the persecution which Nero Cæsar had
raised against them. And many years after the great coronation3145 of the apostles, who
had departed out of the world, while ordination to the priesthood was proceeding both in
all Rome and in all Italy, it happened then that there was a great famine in the city of
Rome.3146</p>
<note type="footnote">3141 This is the time often allotted to Peter’s episcopate at Rome, although it is certain that he did not constantly
reside there during that period: we find him the year after at Jerusalem. [The chronological incredibility of this
residence in Rome has been fully demonstrated; but it is so entirely inconsistent with the scriptural history, and
with that of St. Paul in particular, that no other argument is necessary. On the other hand, it appears to me
conclusively established, that St. Peter closed his life in Rome, under Nero. And I think this apostle’s visit fully
explained by the fact that the Roman Christians were so largely “of the circumcision,” that St. Paul himself might
naturally have invited him to share his own labours in Rome, on the well-known rule of his conduct (Rom. xv.
20; 2 Cor. x. 13–16). See vol. vi. elucid. p. 47.]</note>

<head>Acts of Sharbil,3147 Who Was a Priest of Idols, and Was Converted to
the Confession of Christianity in Christ.3148</head>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Sovereign Ruler3149 Trajan Cæsar,3150 and in the third year
of King Abgar the Seventh,3151 which is the year 416 of the kingdom of Alexander king of
the Greeks, and in the priesthood of Sharbil and Barsamya,3152 Trajan Cæsar commanded
the governors of the countries under his dominion that sacrifices and libations should be
increased in all the cities of their administration, and that those who did not sacrifice should
be seized and delivered over to stripes, and to the tearing of combs, and to bitter inflictions
of all kinds of tortures, and should afterwards receive the punishment of the sword.
Now, when the command arrived at the town of Edessa of the Parthians, there was a
great festival, on the eighth of Nisan, on the third day of the week: the whole city was
gathered together by the great altar3153 which was in the middle of the town, opposite the

centuries later than the first. They were first taken down by shorthand-writers, called notarii (notaries), or exceptores,
by which name they are mentioned towards the end of this extract; the Greeks called them ταχυγράφοι.
They were then arranged in proper order by persons called by the Greeks ὑπομνηματογράφοι, and by the Romans
Ab Actis.—The use of ὑπομνήματα and other Greek words seems to show that these Acts were originally written
in that language. Notaries, i.e., actuarii, or at a later day exceptores.—Tr.
3148 The Latin Acta, to which the Greek ὑπομνήματα here employed corresponds, was used to denote the
authorized records of judicial proceedings.—Tr.</note>

honour being attributed to the head of each religious party. Cf. Teaching of Addæus, p. 661: “Neither did King
Abgar compel any man by force to believe in Christ.”</note>

to Bel and Nebu were thrown down.</note>

Record office,3154 all the gods having been brought together, and decorated, and sitting in
honour, both Nebu and Bel together with their fellows. And all the priests were offering
incense of spices and libations,3155 and an odour of sweetness was diffusing itself around,
and sheep and oxen were being slaughtered, and the sound of the harp and the drum was
heard in the whole town. And Sharbil was chief and ruler of all the priests; and he was
honoured above all his fellows, and was clad in splendid and magnificent vestments; and a
headband embossed with figures of gold was set upon his head; and at the bidding of his
word everything that he ordered was done. And Abgar the king, son of the gods, was
standing at the head of the people. And they obeyed Sharbil, because he drew nearer to all
the gods than any of his fellows, and as being the one who according to that which he had
heard from the gods returned an answer to every man.</p>
<p>And, while these things were being done by the command of the king, Barsamya, the
bishop of the Christians, went up to Sharbil, he and Tiridath the elder and Shalula the deacon;
and he said to Sharbil, the high priest: The King Christ, to whom belong heaven and earth,
will demand an account at thy hands of all these souls against whom thou art sinning, and
whom thou art misleading, and turning away from the God of verity and of truth to idols
that are made and deceitful, which are not able to do anything with their hands—moreover
also thou hast no pity on thine own soul, which is destitute of the true life of God; and thou
declarest to this people that the dumb idols talk with thee; and, as if thou wert listening to
something from them, thou puttest thine ear near to one and another of them, and sayest
to this people: The god Nebu bade me say to you, “On account of your sacrifices and oblations
I cause peace in this your country;” and: Bel saith, “I cause great plenty in your land;”
and those who hear this from thee do not discern that thou art greatly deceiving
them—because “they have a mouth and speak not, and they have eyes and see not with
them;” it is ye who bear up them, and not they who bear up3156 you, as ye suppose; and it
is ye who set tables before them, and not they who feed you. And now be persuaded by me
touching that which I say to thee and advise thee. If thou be willing to hearken to me,
abandon idols made, and worship God the Maker of all things, and His Son Jesus Christ.
Do not, because He put on a body and became man and was stretched out on the cross of
death, be ashamed of Him and refuse to worship Him: for, all these things which He endured—
it was for the salvation of men and for their deliverance. For this One who put on
a body is God, the Son of God, Son of the essence of His Father, and Son of the nature of

<note type="footnote">3156 B. adds here: “And in all these things thou hast forgotten God, the Maker of all men, and because of
His long-suffering hast exalted thyself against His mercy, and hast not been willing to turn to Him, so that He
might turn to thee and deliver thee from this error, in which thou standest.”</note>

Him who begat Him: for He is the adorable brightness of His Godhead, and is the glorious
manifestation of His majesty, and together with His Father He existed from eternity and
from everlasting, His arm, and His right hand, and His power, and His wisdom, and His
strength, and the living Spirit which is from Him, the Expiator and Sanctifier of all His
worshippers. These are the things which Palut taught us, with whom thy venerable self3157
was acquainted; and thou knowest that Palut was the disciple of Addæus the apostle. Abgar
the king also, who was older than this Abgar, who himself worshippeth idols as well as thou,
he too believed in the King Christ, the Son of Him whom thou callest Lord of all the gods.3158
For it is forbidden to Christians to worship anything that is made, and is a creature, and in
its nature is not God: even as ye worship idols made by men,3159 who themselves also are
made and created. Be persuaded, therefore, by these things which I have said to thee, which
things are the belief of the Church: for I know that all this population are looking to thee,
and I am well assured that, if thou be persuaded, many also will persuaded with thee.3160</p>
<p>Sharbil said to him: Very acceptable to me are these thy words which thou hast spoken
before me; yea, exceedingly acceptable are they to me. But, as for me, I know that I am
outcast from3161 all these things, and there is no longer any remedy for me. And, now that
hope is cut off from me, why weariest thou thyself about a man dead and buried,3162 for
whose death there is no hope of resuscitation? For I am slain by paganism, and am become
a dead man, the property of the Evil One: in sacrifices and libations of imposture have I
consumed all the days of my life.</p>
<p>And, when Barsamya the bishop heard these things,3163 he fell down before his feet,
and said to him: There is hope for those who turn, and healing for those that are wounded.
I myself will be surety to thee for the abundant mercies of the Son Christ: that He will pardon
thee all the sins which thou hast committed against Him, in that thou hast worshipped and
honoured His creatures instead of Himself. For that Gracious One, who extended Himself
on the cross of death, will not withhold His grace from the souls that comply with His precepts

and take refuge in His kindness which has been displayed towards us. Like as He did towards
the robber, so is He able to do to thee, and also to those who are like thee.</p>
<p>Sharbil said to him: Thou, like a skilful physician, who suffers pain from the pain of
the afflicted, hast done well in that thou hast been concerned about me. But at present, because
it is the festival to-day of this people, of every one of them, I cannot go down with thee
to-day to the church. Depart thou, and go down with honour; and to-morrow at night I
will come down to thee: I too have henceforth renounced for myself the gods made with
hands, and I will confess the Lord Christ, the Maker of all men.</p>
<p>And the next day Sharbil arose and went down to Barsamya by night, he and Babai his
sister; and he was received by the whole church. And he said to them: Offer for me prayer
and supplication, that Christ may forgive me all the sins that I have committed against Him
in all this long course of years. And, because they were in dread of the persecutors, they
arose and gave him the seal of salvation,3164 whilst he confessed the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.3165</p>
<p>And, when all the city had heard that he was gone down to the church, there began to
be a consternation among the multitude; and they arose and went down to him, and saw
him clad in the fashion of the Christians.3166 And he said to them: May the Son Christ
forgive me all the sins that I have committed against you, and all in which I made you think
that the gods talked with me, whereas they did not talk; and, forasmuch as I have been to
you a cause of abomination, may I now be to you a cause of good: instead of worshipping,
as formerly, idols made with hands, may ye henceforth worship God the Maker. And, when
they had heard these things, there remained with him a great congregation of men and of
women; and Labu also, and Hafsai, and Barcalba, and Avida, chief persons of the city. They
all said to Sharbil: Henceforth we also renounce that which thou hast renounced, and we
confess the King Christ, whom thou hast confessed.</p>

<pb n="1876"/>
<p>But Lysanias,3167 the judge of the country, when he heard3168 that Sharbil had done
this,3169 sent by night3170 and carried him off from the church. And there went up with
him many Christians. And he sat down, to hear him and to judge him, before the altar
which is in the middle of the town, where he used to sacrifice to the gods. And he said to
him: Wherefore hast thou renounced the gods, whom thou didst worship, and to whom
thou didst sacrifice, and to whom thou wast made chief of the priests, and lo! dost today
confess Christ, whom thou didst formerly deny? For see how those Christians, to whom
thou art gone, renounce not that which they have held,3171 like as thou hast renounced that
in which thou wast born. If thou art assured of the gods, how is it that thou hast renounced
them this day? But, if on the contrary thou art not assured, as thou declarest concerning
them, how is it that thou didst once sacrifice to them and worship them?</p>
<p>Sharbil said: When I was blinded in my mind, I worshipped that which I knew not; but
to-day, inasmuch as I have obtained the clear eyes of the mind, it is henceforth impossible
that I should stumble at carved stones, or that I should any longer be the cause of stumbling
to others. For it is a great disgrace to him whose eyes are open, if he goes and falls into the
pit of destruction.</p>
<p>The judge said: Because thou hast been priest of the venerable gods, and hast been
partaker of the mystery of those whom the mighty emperors3172 worship, I will have patience
with thee, in order that thou mayest be persuaded by me, and not turn away from the service
of the gods; but, if on the contrary thou shalt not be persuaded by me, by those same gods
whom thou hast renounced I swear that, even as on a man that is a murderer, so will I inflict
tortures on thee, and will avenge on thee the wrong done to the gods, whom thou hast rebelled
against and renounced, and also the insult which thou hast poured upon them; nor
will I leave untried any kind of tortures which I will not inflict on thee; and, like as thine
honour formerly was great, so will I make thine ignominy great this day.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: I too, on my part, am not content that thou shouldest look upon me as
formerly, when I worshipped gods made with hands; but look thou upon me to-day and
question me as a Christian man renouncing idols and confessing the King Christ.</p>

<p>The judge said: How is it that thou art not afraid of the emperors, nor moved to shame
by those who are listening to thy trial, that thou sayest, “I am a Christian”? But promise
that thou wilt sacrifice to the gods, according to thy former custom, so that thy honour may
be great, as formerly—lest I make to tremble at thee all those who have believed like thyself.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Of the King of kings I am afraid, but at any king of earth I tremble not,
nor yet at thy threats towards me, which lo! thou utterest against the worshippers of Christ:
whom I confessed yesterday, and lo! I am brought to trial for His sake to-day, like as He
Himself was brought to trial for the sake of sinners like me.</p>
<p>The judge said: Although thou have no pity on thyself, still I will have pity on thee, and
refrain from cutting off those hands of thine with which thou hast placed incense before
the gods, and from stopping with thy blood those ears of thine which have heard their
mysteries, and thy tongue which has interpreted and explained to us their secret things. Of
those gods lo! I am afraid, and I have pity on thee. But, if thou continue thus, those gods be
my witnesses that I will have no pity on thee!</p>
<p>Sharbil said: As a man who art afraid of the emperors and tremblest at idols, have thou
no pity on me. For, as for me, I know not what thou sayest: therefore also is my mind not
shaken or terrified by those things which thou sayest. For by thy judgments shall all they
escape from the judgment to come who do not worship that which is not God in its own
nature.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let him be scourged with thongs,3173 because he has dared to answer
me thus, and has resisted the command of the emperors, and has not appreciated the honour
which the gods conferred on him: inasmuch as, lo! he has renounced them.
And he was scourged by ten men, who laid hold on him, according to the command of
the judge.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou art not aware of the scourging of justice in that world which is to
come. For thou wilt cease, and thy judgments also will pass away; but justice will not pass
away, nor will its retributions come to an end.</p>
<p>The judge3174 said: Thou art so intoxicated with this same Christianity, that thou dost
not even know3175 before whom thou art judged, and by whom it is that thou art
scourged—even by those who formerly held thee in honour, and paid adoration to thy
priesthood in the gods. Why dost thou hate honour, and love this ignominy? For, although

thou speakest contrary to the law, yet I myself cannot turn aside from the laws of the emperors.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: As thou takest heed not to depart from the laws of the emperors, and if
moreover thou depart from them thou knowest what command they will give concerning
thee, so do I also take heed not to decline from the law of Him who said, “Thou shalt not
worship any image, nor any likeness;” and therefore will I not sacrifice to idols made with
hands: for long enough was the time in which I sacrificed to them, when I was in ignorance.</p>
<p>The judge said: Bring not upon thee punishment3176 in addition to the punishment
which thou hast already brought upon thee. Enough is it for thee to have said, “I will not
sacrifice:” do not dare to insult the gods, by calling them manufactured idols whom even
the emperors honour.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: But, if on behalf of the emperors, who are far away and not near at hand
and not conscious of those who treat their commands with contempt, thou biddest me
sacrifice, how is it that on behalf of idols, who lo! are present and are seen, but see not, thou
biddest me sacrifice? Why, hereby thou hast declared before all thy attendants3177 that,
because they have a mouth and speak not, lo! thou art become a pleader for them: dumb
idols “to whom their makers shall be like,” and “every one that trusteth upon them” shall
be like thee.</p>
<p>The judge said: It was not for this that thou wast called before me—that, instead of
paying the honour which is due, thou shouldst despise the emperors. But draw near to the
gods and sacrifice, and have pity on thyself, thou self-despiser!
Sharbil said: Why should it be requisite for thee to ask me many questions, after that
which I have said to thee: “I will not sacrifice”? Thou hast called me a self-despiser? But
would that from my childhood I had had this mind and had thus despised myself,3178 which
was perishing!</p>
<p>The judge said: Hang him up, and tear him with combs on his sides.—And while he
was thus torn he cried aloud and said: It is for the sake of Christ, who has secretly caused
His light to arise upon the darkness of my mind. And, when he had thus spoken, the judge
commanded again that he should be torn with combs on his face.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: It is better that thou shouldest inflict tortures upon me for not sacrificing,
than that I should be judged there for having sacrificed to the work of men’s hands.</p>

<p>Then he commanded that he should go up to the prison, and that he should be cast into
a dark dungeon. And the executioners,3179 and the Christians who had come up with him
from the church, carried him, because he was not able to walk upon his feet in consequence
of his having been bent backwards. And he was in the gaol many days.</p>

down to his judgment-hall by night; and the whole body of his attendants was with him;
and he commanded the keeper of the prison, and they brought him before him. And the
judge said to him: This long while hast thou been in prison: what has been thy determination
concerning those things on which thou wast questioned before me? Dost thou consent to
minister to the gods according to thy former custom, agreeably to the command of the
emperors?</p>
<p>Sharbil said: This has been my determination in the prison, that that with which I began
before thee, I will finish even to the last; nor will I play false with my word. For I will not
again confess idols, which I have renounced; nor will I renounce the King Christ, whom I
have confessed.</p>
<p>The judge said: Hang him up by his right hand, because he has withdrawn it from the
gods that he may not again offer incense with it, until his hand with which he ministered
to the gods be dislocated, because he persists in this saying of his.</p>
<p>And, while he was suspended by his hand, they asked him and said to him: Dost thou
consent to sacrifice to the gods? But he was not able to return them an answer, on account
of the dislocation of his arm. And the judge commanded, and they loosed him and took
him down. But he was not able to bring his arm up to his side, until the executioners pressed
it and brought it up to his side.</p>
<p>The judge said: Put on incense, and go whithersoever thou wilt, and no one shall
compel thee to be a priest again. But, if thou wilt not, I will show thee tortures bitterer than
these.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: As for gods that made not the heavens and the earth, may they perish from
under these heavens! But thou, menace me not with words of threatening; but, instead of
words, show upon me the deeds of threatening, that I hear thee not again making mention
of the detestable name of gods!
The judge said: Let him be branded with the brand of bitter fire between his eyes and
upon his cheeks.</p>

<pb n="1880"/>
<p>And the executioners did so, until the smell of the branding reeked forth in the midst
of the judgment-hall: but he refused to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou hast heard for thyself from me, when I said to thee “Thou art not
aware of the smoke of the roasting of the fire which is prepared for those who, like thee,
confess idols made by hands, and deny the living God, after thy fashion.”</p>
<p>The judge said: Who taught thee all these things, that thou shouldest speak before me
thus—a man who was a friend of the gods and an enemy of Christ, whereas, lo! thou art
become his advocate.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Christ whom I have confessed, He it is that hath taught me to speak thus.
But there needeth not that I should be His advocate, for His own mercies are eloquent advocates
for guilty ones like me, and these will avail to plead3181 on my behalf in the day
when the sentences shall be eternal.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let him be hanged up, and let him be torn with combs upon his former
wounds; also let salt and vinegar be rubbed into the wounds upon his sides. Then he said
to him: Renounce not the gods whom thou didst formerly confess.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Have pity on me and spare me again from saying that there be gods, and
powers, and fates, and nativities. On the contrary, I confess one God, who made the heavens,
and the earth, and the seas, and all that is therein; and the Son who is from Him, the King
Christ.</p>
<p>The judge said: It is not about this that thou art questioned before me—viz.: what is
the belief of the Christians which thou hast confessed; but this is what I said to thee, “Renounce
not those gods to whom thou wast made priest.”
Sharbil said: Where is that wisdom of thine and of the emperors of whom thou makest
thy boast, that ye worship the work of the hands of the artificers and confess them, whilst
the artificers themselves, who made the idols, ye insult by the burdens and imposts which
ye lay upon them? The artificer standeth up at thy presence, to do honour to thee; and thou
standest up in the presence of the work of the artificer, and dost honour it and worship it.</p>
<p>The judge said: Thou art not the man to call others to account for3182 these things; but
from thyself a strict account is demanded, as to the cause for which thou hast renounced
the gods, and refusest to offer them incense like thy fellow-priests.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Death on account of this is true life: those who confess the King Christ,
He also will confess before His glorious Father.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let lighted candles3183 be brought, and let them be passed round about
his face and about the sides of his wounds. And they did so a long while.</p>

<p>Sharbil said: It is well that thou burnest me with this fire, that so I may be delivered
from “that fire which is not quenched, and the worm that dieth not,” which is threatened
to those3184 who worship things made instead of the Maker: for it is forbidden to the
Christians to honour or worship anything except the nature of Him who is God Most High.
For that which is made and is created is designed to be a worshipper of its Maker, and is not
to be worshipped along with its Creator, as thou supposest.</p>
<p>The governor said: It is not this for which the emperors have ordered me to demand
an account at thy hands, whether there be judgment and the rendering of an account after
the death of men; nor yet about this do I care, whether that which is made is to be honoured
or not to be honoured. What the emperors have commanded me is this: that, whosoever
will not sacrifice to the gods and offer incense to them, I should employ against him stripes,
and combs, and sharp swords.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: The kings of this world are conscious of this world only; but the King of
all kings, He hath revealed and shown to us that there is another world, and a judgment in
reserve, in which a recompense will be made, on the one hand to those who have served
God, and on the other to those who have not served Him nor confessed Him. Therefore
do I cry aloud, that I will not again sacrifice to idols, nor will I offer oblations to devils, nor
will I do honour to demons!</p>
<p>The judge said: Let nails of iron be driven in between the eyes of the insolent fellow,
and let him go to that world which he is looking forward to, like a fanatic.3185
And the executioners did so, the sound of the driving in of the nails being heard as they
were being driven in sharply.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou hast driven in nails between my eyes, even as nails were driven into
the hands of the glorious Architect of the creation, and by reason of this did all orders of
the creation tremble and quake at that season. For these tortures which lo! thou art inflicting
on me are nothing in view of that judgment which is to come. For those “whose ways are
always firm,” because “they have not the judgment of God before their eyes,”3186 and who
on this account do not even confess that God exists—neither will He confess them.</p>
<p>The judge said: Thou sayest in words that there is a judgment; but I will show thee in
deeds: so that, instead of that judgment which is to come, thou mayest tremble and be afraid
of this one which is before thine eyes, in which lo! thou art involved, and not multiply thy
speech before me.</p>

<p>Sharbil said: Whosoever is resolved to set God before his eyes in secret, God will also
be at his right hand; and I too am not afraid of thy threats of tortures, with which thou dost
menace me and seek to make me afraid.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let Christ, whom thou hast confessed, deliver thee from all the tortures
which I have inflicted on thee, and am about further to inflict on thee; and let Him show
His deliverance towards thee openly, and save thee out of my hands.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: This is the true deliverance of Christ imparted to me—this secret power
which He has given me to endure all the tortures thou art inflicting on me, and whatsoever
it is settled in thy mind still further to inflict upon me; and, although thou hast plainly seen
it to be so, thou hast refused to credit my word.</p>
<p>The judge said: Take him away from before me, and let him be hanged upon a beam
the contrary way, head downwards; and let him be beaten with whips while he is hanging.</p>
<p>And the executioners did so to him, at the door of the judgment-hall.</p>
<p>Then the governor commanded, and they brought him in before him. And he said to
him: Sacrifice to the gods, and do the will of the emperors, thou priest that hatest honour
and lovest ignominy instead!</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Why dost thou again repeat thy words, and command me to sacrifice, after
the many times that thou hast heard from me that I will not sacrifice again? For it is not
any compulsion on the part of the Christians that has kept me back from sacrifices, but the
truth they hold: this it is that has delivered me from the error of paganism.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let him be put into a chest3187 of iron like a murderer, and let him be
scourged with thongs like a malefactor.
And the executioners did so, until there remained not a sound place on him.
Sharbil said: As for these tortures, which thou supposest to be bitter, out of the midst
of their bitterness will spring up for me fountains of deliverance and mercy in the day of
the eternal sentences.</p>
<p>The governor said: Let small round pieces of wood be placed between the fingers of his
hands,3188 and let these be squeezed upon them vehemently.3189</p>
<p>And they did so to him, until the blood came out from under the nails of his fingers.</p>
<note type="footnote">3187 So Cureton. Dr. Payne Smith remarks: “Cureton’s ‘chest’ is a guess from <gap reason="omitted"/>. The only sense of <gap reason="omitted"/>

<pb n="1883"/>
<p>Sharbil said: If thine eye be not satisfied with the tortures of the body, add still further
to its tortures whatsoever thou wilt.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let the fingers of his hands be loosed, and make him sit upon the ground;
and bind his hands upon his knees, and thrust a piece of wood under his knees, and let it
pass over the bands of his hands, and hang him up by his feet, thus bent, head downwards;
and let him be scourged with thongs.</p>
<p>And they did so to him.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: They cannot conquer who fight against God, nor may they be overcome
whose confidence is God; and therefore do I say, that “neither fire nor sword, nor death nor
life, nor height nor depth, can separate my heart from the love of God, which is in our Lord
Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>The judge said: Make hot a ball of lead and of brass, and place it under his armpits.
And they did so, until his ribs began to be seen.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: The tortures thou dost inflict upon me are too little for thy rage against
me—unless thy rage were little and thy tortures were great.</p>
<p>The judge said: Thou wilt not hurry me on by these things which thou sayest; for I have
room in my mind3190 to bear long with thee, and to behold every evil and shocking and
bitter thing which3191 I shall exhibit in the torment of thy body, because thou wilt not consent
to sacrifice to the gods whom thou didst formerly worship.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Those things which I have said and repeated before thee, thou in thine
unbelief knowest not how to hear: now, supposest thou that thou knowest those things
which are in my mind?</p>
<p>The judge said: The answers which thou givest will not help thee, but will multiply
upon thee inflictions manifold.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: If the several stories of thy several gods are by thee accepted as true, yet is
it matter of shame to us to tell of what sort they are. For one had intercourse with boys,
which is not right; and another fell in love with a maiden, who fled for refuge into a tree, as
your shameful stories tell.</p>
<p>The judge said: This fellow, who was formerly a respecter of the gods, but has now
turned to insult them and has not been afraid, and has also despised the command of the
emperors and has not trembled—set him to stand upon a gridiron3192 heated with fire.
And the executioners did so, until the under part of his feet was burnt off.</p>

till the savour of his burnt flesh ascended from his body.”</note>

<p>Sharbil said: If thy rage is excited at my mention of the abominable and obscene tales
of thy gods, how much more does it become thee to be ashamed of their acts! For lo! if a
person were to do what one of thy gods did, and they were to bring him before thee, thou
wouldest pass sentence of death upon him.</p>
<p>The judge said: This day will I bring thee to account for thy blasphemy against the gods,
and thine audacity in insulting also the emperors; nor will I leave thee alone until thou offer
incense to them, according to thy former custom.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Stand by thy threats, then, and speak not falsely; and show towards me in
deeds the authority of the emperors which they have given thee; and do not thyself bring
reproach on the emperors with thy falsehood, and be thyself also despised in the eyes of
thine attendants!</p>
<p>The judge said: Thy blasphemy against the gods and thine audacity towards the emperors
have brought upon thee these tortures which thou art undergoing; and, if thou add further
to thine audacity, there shall be further added to thee inflictions bitterer than these.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou hast authority, as judge: do whatsoever thou wilt, and show no pity.
The judge said: How can he that hath had no pity on his own body, so as to avoid suffering
in it these tortures, be afraid or ashamed of not obeying the command of the emperors?</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou hast well said that I am not ashamed: because near at hand is He
that justifieth me, and my soul is caught up in rapture towards him. For, whereas I once
provoked Him to anger by the sacrifices of idols, I am this day pacifying Him by the inflictions
I endure in my person: for my soul is a captive to God who became man.</p>
<p>The judge said: It is a captive, then, that I am questioning, and a madman without sense;
and with a dead man who is burnt, lo! am I talking.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: If thou art assured that I am mad, question me no further: for it is a
madman that is being questioned; nay, rather, I am a dead man who is burnt, as thou hast
said.</p>
<p>The judge said: How shall I count thee a dead man, When lo! thou hast cried aloud, “I
will not sacrifice?”
Sharbil said: I myself, too, know not how to return thee an answer, since thou hast
called me a dead man and yet turnest to question me again as if alive.</p>
<p>The judge said: Well have I called thee a dead man, because thy feet are burnt and thou
carest not, and thy face is scorched and thou holdest thy peace, and nails are driven in
between thine eyes and thou takest no account of it, and thy ribs are seen between the furrows
of the combs and thou insultest the emperors, and thy whole body is mangled and maimed
with stripes and thou blasphemest against the gods; and, because thou hatest thy body, lo!
thou sayest whatsoever pleaseth thee.</p>

<pb n="1885"/>
<p>Sharbil said: If thou callest me audacious because I have endured these things, it is fit
that thou, who hast inflicted them upon me, shouldest be called a murderer in thy acts and
a blasphemer in thy words.</p>
<p>The judge said: Lo! thou hast insulted the emperors, and likewise the gods; and lo! thou
insultest me also, in order that I may pronounce sentence of death upon thee quickly. But
instead of this, which thou lookest for, I am prepared yet further to inflict upon thee bitter
and severe tortures.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou knowest what I have said to thee many times: instead of denunciations
of threatening, proceed to show upon me the performance of the threat, that thou
mayest be known to do the will of the emperors.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let him be torn with combs upon his legs and upon the sides of his
thighs.</p>
<p>And the executioners did so, until his blood flowed and ran down upon the ground.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Thou hast well done in treating me thus: because I have heard that one
of the teachers of the Church hath said,3193 “Scars are on my body, that I may come to the
resurrection from the place of the dead.” Me too, who was a dead man out of sight, lo! thine
inflictions bring to life again.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let him be torn with combs on his face, since he is not ashamed of the
nails which are driven in between his eyes.</p>
<p>And they tore him with combs upon his cheeks, and between the nails which were
driven into them.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: I will not obey the emperors, who command that to be worshipped and
honoured which is not of the nature of God, and is not God in its nature, but is the work of
him that made it.</p>
<p>The judge said: Like as the emperors worship, so also worship thou; and that honour
which the judges render, do thou render also.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Even though I insult that which is the work of men and has no perception
and no feeling of anything, yet do not thou insult God, the Maker of all, nor worship along
with Him that which is not of Him, and is foreign to His nature.</p>
<p>The judge said: Does this your doctrine so teach you, that you should insult the very
luminaries which give light to all the regions of the earth?</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Although it is not enjoined upon us to insult them, yet it is enjoined upon
us not to worship them nor honour them, seeing that they are things made: for this were
an insufferable3194 wrong, that a thing made should be worshipped along with its Maker;
and it is an insult to the Maker that His creatures should be honoured along with Himself.</p>

<p>The judge said: Christ whom thou confessest was hanged on a tree; and on a tree will
I hang thee, like thy Master.</p>
<p>And they hanged him on a tree3195 a long while.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: As for Christ, whom lo! thou mockest—see how thy many gods were unable
to stand before Him: for lo! they are despised and rejected, and are made a laughing-stock
and a jest by those who used formerly to worship them.</p>
<p>The judge said: How is it that thou renouncest the gods, and confessest Christ, who
was hanged on a tree?</p>
<p>Sharbil said: This cross of Christ is the great boast of the Christians, since it is by this
that the deliverance of salvation has come to all His worshippers, and by this that they have
had their eyes enlightened, so as not to worship creatures along with the Creator.
The governor said: Let thy boasting of the cross be kept within thy own mind, and let
incense be offered by thy hands to the gods.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: Those who have been delivered by the cross cannot any longer worship
and serve the idols of error made with hands: for creature cannot worship creature, because
it is itself also designed to be a worshipper of Him who made it; and that it should be worshipped
along with its Maker is an insult to its Maker, as I have said before.</p>
<p>The governor said: Leave alone thy books which have taught thee to speak thus, and
perform the command of the emperors, that thou idle not by the emperors’ law.</p>
<p>But Sharbil said: Is this, then, the justice of the emperors, in whom thou takest such
pride, that we should leave alone the law of God and keep their laws?</p>
<p>The governor said: The citation of the books in which thou believest, and from which
thou hast quoted—it is this which has brought upon thee these afflictions: for, if thou hadst
offered incense to the gods, great would have been thine honour, like as it was formerly, as
priest of the gods.</p>
<p>Sharbil said: To thine unbelieving heart these things seem as if they were afflictions;
but to the true heart “affliction imparts patience, and from it comes also experience, and
from experience likewise the hope”3196 of the confessor.3197</p>
<p>The governor said: Hang him up and tear him with combs upon his former wounds.
And, from the fury with which the judge urged on the executioners, his very bowels
were almost seen. And, lest he should die under the combs and escape from still further
tortures, he gave orders and they took him down.</p>
<p>And, when the judge saw that he was become silent and was not able to return him any
further answer, he refrained from him a little while, until he began to revive.</p>

<p>Sharbil said: Why hast thou had pity upon me for even this little time, and kept me
back from the gain of a confessor’s death?3198</p>
<p>The governor said: I have not had pity on thee at all in refraining for a little while: thy
silence it was that made me pause a little; and, if I had power beyond the law of the emperors,
I should like to lay other tortures upon thee, so as to be more fully avenged on thee for thine
insult toward the gods: for in despising me thou hast despised the gods; and I, on my part,
have borne with thee and tortured thee thus, as a man who so deserves.</p>
<p>And the judge gave orders, and suddenly the curtain3199 fell before him for a short time;
and he settled and drew up the sentence3200 which he should pronounce against him publicly.</p>
<p>And suddenly the curtain was drawn back again; and the judge cried aloud and said:
As regards this Sharbil, who was formerly priest of the gods, but has turned this day and
renounced the gods, and has cried aloud “I am a Christian,” and has not trembled at the
gods, but has insulted them; and, further, has not been afraid of the emperors and their
command; and, though I have bidden him sacrifice to the gods according to his former
custom, has not sacrificed, but has treated them with the greatest insult: I have looked into
the matter, and decided, that towards a man who doeth these things, even though he were
now to sacrifice, it is not fit that any mercy should be shown; and that it is not fit that he
should any longer behold the sun of his lords, because he has scorned their laws. I give
sentence that, according to the law of the emperors, a strap3201 be thrust into the mouth of
the insulter, as into the mouth of a murderer, and that he depart outside of the city of the
emperors with haste, as one who has insulted the lords of the city and the gods who hold
authority over it. I give sentence that he be sawn with a saw of wood, and that, when he is
near to die, then his head be taken off with the sword of the headsmen.</p>
<p>And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth with all speed, and the executioners
hurried him off, and made him run quickly upon his burnt feet, and took him away outside
of the city, a crowd of people running after him. For they had been standing looking on at
his trial all day, and wondering that he did not suffer under his afflictions: for his countenance,
which was cheerful, testified to the joy of his heart. And, when the executioners arrived
at the place where he was to receive the punishment of death, the people of the city were
with them, that they might see whether they did according as the judge had commanded,
and hear what Sharbil might say at that season, so that they might inform the judge of the
country.</p>

<p>And they offered him some wine to drink, according to the custom of murderers to
drink. But he said to them: I will not drink, because I wish to feel the saw with which ye
saw me, and the sword which ye pass over my neck; but instead of this wine, which will not
be of any use to me, give me a little time to pray, while ye stand. And he stood up, and
looked toward the east,3202 and lifted up his voice and said: Forgive me, Christ, all the sins
I have committed against Thee, and all the times in which I have provoked Thee to anger
by the polluted sacrifices of dead idols; and have pity on me and save me,3203 and deliver
me from the judgment to come; and be merciful to me, as Thou wast merciful to the robber;
and receive me like the penitents who have been converted and have turned to Thee, as
Thou also hast turned to them; and, whereas I have entered into Thy vineyard, at the eleventh
hour, instead of judgment, deliver me from justice: let Thy death, which was for the sake
of sinners, restore to life again my slain body in the day of Thy coming.</p>
<p>And, when the Sharirs of the city heard these things, they were very angry with the executioners
for having given him leave to pray.
And, while the nails were remaining which had been driven in between his eyes, and
his ribs were seen between the wounds of the combs, and while from the burning on his
sides and the soles of his feet, which were scorched and burnt, and from the gashes of the
combs on his face, and on his sides, and on his thighs, and on his legs, the blood was flowing
and running down, they brought carpenters’ instruments, and thrust him into a wooden
vice, and tightened it upon him until the bones of his joints creaked with the pressure; then
they put upon him a saw of iron, and began sawing him asunder; and, when he was just
about to die, because the saw had reached to his mouth, they smote him with the sword and
took off his head, while he was still squeezed down in the vice.
And Babai his sister drew near and spread out her skirt and caught his blood; and she
said to him: May my spirit be united with thy spirit in the presence of Christ, whom thou
hast known and believed.
And the Sharirs of the city ran and came and informed the judge of the things which
Sharbil had uttered in his prayer, and how his sister had caught his blood. And the judge
commanded them to return and give orders to the executioners that, on the spot where she
had caught the blood of her brother, she also should receive the punishment of death. And
the executioners laid hold on her, and each one of them severally put her to torture; and,
with her brother’s blood upon her, her soul took its flight from her, and they mingled her
blood with his. And, when the executioners were entered into the city, the brethren and
young men3204 ran and stole away their two corpses; and they laid them in the burial-place
of the father of Abshelama the bishop, on the fifth of Ilul, the eve of the Sabbath.

<p>This Barsamya,3206 the bishop, made a disciple of Sharbil the priest. And he lived in
the days of Binus,3207 bishop of Rome; in whose days the whole population of Rome assembled
together, and cried out to the prætor3208 of their city, and said to him: There are
too many strangers in this our city, and these cause famine and dearness of everything: but
we beseech thee to command them to depart out of the city. And, when he had commanded
them to depart out of the city, these strangers assembled themselves together, and said to
the prætor: We beseech thee, my lord, command also that the bones of our dead may depart
with us. And he commanded them to take the bones of their dead, and to depart. And all
the strangers assembled themselves together to take the bones of Simon Cephas and of Paul,
the apostles; but the people of Rome said to them: We will not give you the bones of the
apostles. And the strangers said to them: Learn ye and understand that Simon, who is called
Cephas, is of Bethsaida of Galilee, and Paul the apostle is of Tarsus, a city of Cilicia. And,
when the people of Rome knew that this matter was so, then they let them alone. And, when
they had taken them up and were removing them from their places, immediately there was
a great earthquake; and the buildings of the city were on the point of falling down, and the
city was near being overthrown. And, when the people of Rome saw it, they turned and
besought the strangers to remain in their city, and that the bones might be laid in their places
again. And, when the bones of the apostles were returned to their places, there was quietness,
and the earthquakes ceased, and the winds became still, and the air became bright, and the
whole city became cheerful. And when the Jews and pagans saw it, they also ran and fell at
the feet of Fabianus, the bishop of their city, the Jews crying out: We confess Christ, whom
we crucified: He is the Son of the living-God, of whom the prophets spoke in their mysteries.
And the pagans also cried out and said to him: We renounce idols and carved images, which
are of no use, and we believe in Jesus the King, the Son of God, who has come and is to come

these also renounced their doctrines, like as the pagans had renounced theirs, and confessed
the Gospel of the apostles, which was preached in the church.</p>

<head>Further, the Martyrdom of Barsamya,3209 the Bishop of the Blessed
City Edessa.</head>
<p>In the year four hundred and sixteen of the kingdom of the Greeks, that is the fifteenth
year of the reign of the sovereign ruler, our lord, Trajan Cæsar, in the consulship of Commodus
and Cyrillus,3210 in the month Ilul, on the fifth day of the month, the day after Lysinus,
3211 the judge of the country, had heard the case of Sharbil the priest; as the judge was
sitting in his judgment-hall, the Sharirs of the city came before him and said to him: We
give information before thine Excellency concerning Barsamya, the leader of the Christians,
that he went up to Sharbil, the priest, as he was standing and ministering before the venerable
gods, and sent and called him to him secretly, and spoke to him, quoting from the books in
which he reads in the church where their congregation meets, and recited to him the belief
of the Christians, and said to him, “It is not right for thee to worship many gods, but only
one God, and His Son Jesus Christ”—until he made him a disciple, and induced him to renounce
the gods whom he had formerly worshipped; and by means of Sharbil himself also
many have become disciples, and are gone down to the church, and lo! this day they confess
Christ; and even Avida, and Nebo,3212 and Barcalba, and Hafsai, honourable and chief
persons of the city, have yielded to Sharbil in this. We, accordingly, as Sharirs of the city,
make this known before thine Excellency, in order that we may not receive punishment as
offenders for not having declared before thine Excellency the things which were spoken in
secret to Sharbil by Barsamya the guide of the church. Thine Excellency now knoweth what
it is right to command in respect of this said matter.</p>
<p>And, immediately that the judge heard these things, he sent the Sharirs of the city, and
some of his attendants with them, to go down to the church and bring up Barsamya from
the church. And they led him and brought him up to the judgment-hall of the judge; and
there went up many Christians with him, saying: We also will die with Barsamya, because
we too are of one mind with him in respect to the doctrine of which he made Sharbil a disciple,
and in all that he spoke to him, and in all the instruction that Sharbil received from
him, so that he was persuaded by him, and died for the sake of that which he heard from
him.</p>

<p>And the Sharirs of the city came, and said to the judge: Barsamya, as thine Excellency
commanded, lo! is standing at the door of the judgment-hall of thy Lordship;3213 and honourable
chief-persons of the city, who became disciples along with Sharbil, lo! are standing
by Barsamya, and crying out, “We will all die with Barsamya, who is our teacher and guide.”</p>
<p>And, when the judge heard those things which the Sharirs of the city had told him, he
commanded them to go out and write down the names of the persons who were crying out,
“We will die with Barsamya.” And, when they went out to write down the names of these
persons, those who so cried out were too many for them, and they were not able to write
down their names, because they were so many: for the cry kept coming to them from all
sides, that they “would die for Christ’s sake along with Barsamya.”</p>
<p>And, when the tumult of the crowd became great, the Sharirs of the city turned back,
and came in to the judge, and said to him: We are not able to write down the names of the
persons who are crying aloud outside, because they are too many to be numbered. And the
judge commanded that Barsamya should be taken up to the prison, so that the crowd might
be dispersed which was collected together about him, lest through the tumult of the multitude
there should be some mischief in the city. And, when he went up the gaol, those who had
become disciples along with Sharbil continued with him.</p>
<p>And after many days were passed the judge rose up in the morning and went down to
his judgment-hall, in order that he might hear the case of Barsamya. And the judge commanded,
and they brought him from the prison; and he came in and stood before him. The
officers said: Lo, he standeth before thine Excellency.</p>
<p>The judge said: Art thou Barsamya, who hast been made ruler and guide of the people
of the Christians, and didst make a disciple of Sharbil, who was chief-priest of the gods, and
used to worship them?
Barsamya said: It is I who have done this, and I do not deny it; and I am prepared to
die for the truth of this.</p>
<p>The judge said: How is it that thou wast not afraid of the command of the emperors,
so that, when the emperors commanded that every one should sacrifice, thou didst induce
Sharbil, when he was standing and sacrificing to the gods and offering incense to them, to
deny that which he had confessed, and confess Christ whom he had denied?
Barsamya said: I was assuredly3214 made a shepherd of men, not for the sake of those
only who are found, but also for the sake of those who have strayed from the fold of truth,
and become food for the wolves of paganism; and, had I not sought to make Sharbil a disciple,
at my hands would his blood have been required; and, if he had not listened to me, I should
have been innocent of his blood.</p>

<pb n="1893"/>
<p>The judge said: Now, therefore, since thou hast confessed that it was thou that madest
Sharbil a disciple, at thy hands will I require his death; and on this account it is right that
thou rather than he shouldest be condemned before me, because by thy hands he has died
the horrible deaths of grievous tortures for having abandoned the command of the emperors
and obeyed thy words.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Not to my words did Sharbil become a disciple, but to the word of God
which He spoke: “Thou shalt not worship images and the likenesses of men.” And it is not
I alone that am content to die the death of Sharbil for his confession of Christ, but also all
the Christians, members of the Church, are likewise eager for this, because they know that
they will secure their salvation before God thereby.</p>
<p>The judge said: Answer me not in this manner, like Sharbil thy disciple, lest thine own
torments be worse than his; but promise that thou wilt sacrifice before the gods on his behalf.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Sharbil, who knew not God, I taught to know Him: and dost thou bid
me, who have known God from my youth, to renounce God? God forbid that I should do
this thing!</p>
<p>The judge said: Ye have made the whole creation disciples of the teaching of Christ;
and lo! they renounce the many gods whom the many worshipped. Give up this way of
thinking,3215 lest I make those who are near tremble at thee as they behold thee to-day, and
those also that are afar off as they hear of the torments to which thou art condemned.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: If God is the help of those who pray to Him, who is he that can resist
them? Or what is the power that can prevail against them? Or thine own threats—what
can they do to them: to men who, before thou give commandment concerning them that
they shall die, have their death already set before their eyes, and are expecting it every day?</p>
<p>The judge said: Bring not the subject of Christ before my judgment-seat; but, instead
of this, obey the command of the emperors, who command to sacrifice to the gods.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Even though we should not lay the subject of Christ before thee, yet the
sufferings of Christ are portrayed indelibly3216 in the worshippers of Christ; and, even more
than thou hearkenest to the commands of the emperors, do we Christians hearken to the
commands of Christ the King of kings.</p>
<p>The judge said: Lo! thou hast obeyed Christ and worshipped him up to his day:
henceforth obey the emperors, and worship the gods whom the emperors worship.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: How canst thou bid me renounce that in which I was born? when lo!
thou didst exact punishment for this at the hand of Sharbil, and saidst to him: Why hast
thou renounced the paganism in which thou wast born, and confessed Christianity to which
thou wast a stranger? Lo! even before I came into thy presence thou didst thyself give
<note type="footnote">3215 Lit. “this mind.”—Tr.</note>
<note type="footnote">3216 Lit. “portrayed and fixed.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1894"/>
testimony on the matter beforehand, and saidst to Sharbil: The Christians, to whom thou
art gone over, do not renounce that in which they were born, but continue in it. Abide,
therefore, by the word, which thou hast spoken.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let Barsamya be scourged, because he has rebelled against the command
of the emperors, and has caused those also who were obedient to the emperors to rebel with
him.</p>
<p>And, when he had been scourged by five men, he said to him: Reject not the command
of the emperors, nor insult the emperors’ gods.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Thy mind is greatly blinded, O judge, and so also is that of the emperors
who gave thee authority; nor are the things that are manifest seen by you; nor do ye perceive
that lo! the whole creation worships Christ; and thou sayest to me, Do not worship Him, as
if I alone worshipped Him—Him whom the watchers3217 above worship on high.</p>
<p>The judge said: But if ye have taught men to worship Christ, who is it that has persuaded
those above to worship Christ?
Barsamya said: Those above have themselves preached, and have taught those below
concerning the living worship of the King Christ, seeing that they worship Him, and His
Father, together with His divine Spirit.3218</p>
<p>The judge said: Give up these things which your writings teach you, and which ye teach
also to others, and obey those things which the emperors have commanded, and spurn not
their laws—lest ye be spurned by means of the sword from the light of this venerable sun.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: The light which passeth away and abideth not is not the true light, but
is only the similitude of that true light, to whose beams darkness cometh not near, which is
reserved and standeth fast for the true worshippers of Christ.</p>
<p>The judge said: Speak not before me of anything else instead of that about which I have
asked thee, lest I dismiss thee from life to death, for denying this light which is seen and
confessing that which is not seen.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: I cannot leave alone that about which thou askest me, and speak of that
about which thou dost not ask me. It was thou that spakest to me about the light of the sun,
and I said before thee that there is a light on high which surpasses in its brightness that of
the sun which thou dost worship and honour. For an account will be required of thee for
worshipping thy fellow-creature instead of God thy Creator.</p>
<p>The judge said: Do not insult the very sun, the light of creatures, nor set thou at nought
the command of the emperors, nor contentiously resist the lords of the country, who have
authority in it.</p>

<pb n="1895"/>
<p>Barsamya said: Of what avail is the light of the sun to a blind man that cannot see it?
For without the eyes of the body, it is not possible for its beams to be seen. So that by this
thou mayest know that it is the work of God, forasmuch as it has no power of its own to
show its light to the sightless.</p>
<p>The judge said: When I have tortured thee as thou deservest, then will I write word
about thee to the Imperial government, reporting what insult thou hast offered to the gods,
in that thou madest a disciple of Sharbil the priest, one who honoured the gods, and that ye
despise the laws of the emperors, and that ye make no account of the judges of the countries,
and live like barbarians, though under the authority of the Romans.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Thou dost not terrify me by these things which thou sayest. It is true,
I am not in the presence of the emperors to-day; yet lo! before the authority which the emperors
have given thee I am now standing, and I am brought to trial, because I said, I will
not renounce God, to whom the heavens and the earth belong, nor His Son Jesus Christ,
the King of all the earth.</p>
<p>The judge said: If thou art indeed assured of this, that thou art standing and being tried
before the authority of the emperors, obey their commands, and rebel not against their laws,
lest like a rebel thou receive the punishment of death.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: But if those who rebel against the emperors, even when they justly rebel,
are deserving of death, as thou sayest; for those who rebel against God, the King of kings,
even the punishment of death by the sword is too little.</p>
<p>The judge said: It was not that thou shouldest expound in my judgment-hall that thou
wast brought in before me, because the trial on which thou standest has but little concern
with expounding, but much concern with the punishment of death, for those who insult
the emperors and comply not with their laws.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Because God is not before your eyes, and ye refuse to hear the word of
God; and graven images that are of no use, “which have a mouth and speak not,” are accounted
by you as though they spake, because your understanding is blinded by the darkness of
paganism in which ye stand—</p>
<p>The judge interrupting said: Leave off those things thou art saying, for they will not
help thee at all, and worship the gods, before the bitter tearings of combs and harsh tortures
come upon thee.</p>
<p>Barsamya said: Do thou too leave off the many questions which lo! thou askest me, and
give command for the stripes and the combs with which thou dost menace me: for thy
words will not help thee so much as thy inflictions will help me.</p>
<p>The judge said: Let Barsamya be hanged up and torn with combs.</p>

<pb n="1896"/>
<p>And at that very moment there came to him letters from Alusis3219 the chief proconsul,
father of emperors.3220 And he commanded, and they took down Barsamya, and he was
not torn with combs; and they took him outside of the hall of judgment.</p>
<p>And the judge commanded that the nobles, and the chief persons, and the princes, and
the honourable persons of the city, should come before him, that they might hear what was
the order that was issued by the emperors, by the hand of the proconsuls, the rulers of the
countries under the authority of the Romans. And it was found that the emperors had
written by the hand of the proconsuls to the judges of the countries:3221 “Since our Majesty
commanded that there should be a persecution against the people of the Christians, we have
heard and learned, from the Sharirs whom we have in the countries under the dominion of
our Majesty, that the people of the Christians are persons who eschew murder, and sorcery,
and adultery, and theft, and bribery and fraud, and those things for which the laws of our
Majesty also exact punishment from those who commit them. We, therefore, in our impartial
justice, have commanded that on account of these things the persecution of the sword shall
cease from them, and that there shall be rest and quietness in all our dominions, they continuing
to minister according to their custom and no man hindering them. It is not, however,
towards them that we show clemency, but towards their laws, agreeing as they do with the
laws of our Majesty. And, if any man hinder them after this our command, that sword
which is ordered by us to descend upon those who despise our command, the same do we
command to descend upon those who despise this decree of our clemency.”</p>
<p>And, when this command of the emperor’s clemency was read, the whole city rejoiced
that there was quietness and rest for every man. And the judge commanded, and they released
Barsamya, that he might go down to his church. And the Christians went up in great
numbers to the judgment-hall, together with a great multitude of the population of the city,
and they received Barsamya with great and exceeding honour, repeating psalms before him,
according to their custom; there went also the wives of the chief of the wise men. And they
thronged about him, and saluted him, and called him “the persecuted confessor,” “the
companion of Sharbil the martyr.” And he said to them: Persecuted I am, like yourselves;
but from the tortures and combs of Sharbil and his companions I am clean escaped.3222
And they said to him: We have heard from thee that a teacher of the Church has said, “The
will, according to what it is, so is it accepted.”3223 And, when he was entered into the church,

he and all the people that were with him, he stood up and prayed, and blessed them and
sent them away to their homes rejoicing and praising God for the deliverance which He had
wrought for them and for the Church.</p>
<p>And the day after Lysinas3224 the judge of the country had set his hand to these Acts,
he was dismissed from his authority.</p>

Abgar, translated into French “from the Armenian version of the fifth century,” and published
in 1868, which is now before me. It ascribes the original to Laboubnia, and adds: “The
name Léroubna, mentioned only by Moses of Chorène, was not repeated after him by any
one else, save, perhaps, Mekhitar d’Aïrivank (one of our chroniclers of the thirteenth century),
who puts him among our historians, between Tatien and Mar Ibas Gadina, but without affirming
whether he knew him only by name or also by his writings.” The editor goes on to
speak of his correspondence with Dr. Cureton (a.d. 1864) which is referred to in note 4, p.

Cureton, and congratulates himself on the entire and integral condition of the Armenian,

<p>Martyrdom of Habib the Deacon.3235</p>
<p>In the month Ab,3236 of the year six hundred and twenty of the kingdom of Alexander
the Macedonian, in the consulate of Licinius and Constantine,3237 which is the year in which
he3238 was born, in the magistracy3239 of Julius and Barak, in the days of Cona,3240 bishop
of Edessa, Licinius made a persecution against the Church and all the people of the Christians,
after that first persecution which Diocletian the emperor had made. And Licinius the emperor
commanded that there should be sacrifices and libations, and that the altars in every
place should be restored, that they might burn sweet spices and frankincense before Zeus.</p>
<p>And, when many were persecuted, they cried out of their own accord: We are Christians;
and they were not afraid of the persecution, because these who were persecuted were more
numerous than those who persecuted them.</p>
<p>Now Habib, who was of the village of Telzeha3241 and had been made a deacon, went
secretly into the churches which were in the villages, and ministered and read the Scriptures,
and encouraged and strengthened many by his words, and admonished them to stand fast
in the truth of their belief, and not to be afraid of the persecutors; and gave them directions.</p>
<p>And, when many were strengthened by his words, and received his addresses affectionately,
being careful not to renounce the covenant they had made, and when the Sharirs of
the city, the men who had been appointed with reference to this particular matter, heard of
it, they went in and informed Lysanias, the governor who was in the town of Edessa, and
said to him: Habib, who is a deacon in the village of Telzeha, goes about and ministers
secretly in every place, and resists the command of the emperors, and is not afraid.</p>
<p>And, when the governor heard these things, he was filled with rage against Habib; and
he made a report, and sent and informed Licinius the emperor of all those things which
Habib was doing; he wished also to ascertain3242 what command would be issued respecting

him and the rest of those who would not sacrifice. For although a command had been issued
that every one should sacrifice, yet it had not been commanded what should be done to
those who did not sacrifice: because they had heard that Constantine, the commander3243
in Gaul and Spain, was become a Christian and did not sacrifice. And Licinius the emperor
thus command Lysanias the governor: Whoever it is that has been so daring as to transgress
our command, our Majesty has commanded that he shall be burned3244 with fire; and that
all others who do not consent to sacrifice shall be put to death by the sword.</p>
<p>Now, when this command came to the town of Edessa, Habib, in reference to whom
the report had been made, was gone across the river to the country of the people of
Zeugma,3245 to minister there also secretly. And, when the governor sent and inquired for
him in his village, and in all the country round about, and he was not to be found, he commanded
that all his family should be arrested, and also the inhabitants of his village; and
they arrested them and put them in irons, his mother and the rest of his family, and also
some of the people of his village; and they brought them to the city, and shut them up in
prison.</p>
<p>And, when Habib heard what had taken place, he considered in his mind and pondered
anxiously in his thoughts: It is expedient for me, said he, that I should go and appear before
the judge of the country, rather than that I should remain in secret and others should be
brought in to him and be crowned with martyrdom because of me, and that I should find
myself in great shame. For in what respect will the name of Christianity help him who flees
from the confession of Christianity? Lo! if he flee from this, the death of nature is before
him whithersoever he goes, and escape from it he cannot, because this is decreed against all
the children of Adam.</p>
<p>And Habib arose and went to Edessa secretly, having prepared his back for the stripes
and his sides for the combs, and his person for the burning of fire. And he went immediately3246
to Theotecna,3247 a veteran3248 who was chief of the band of attendants3249 on
the governor; and he said to him: I am Habib of Telzeha, whom ye are inquiring for. And
Theotecna said to him: If so be that no one saw thee coming to me, hearken to me in what
I say to thee, and depart and go away to the place where thou hast been, and remain there

in this time of persecution; and of this, that thou camest to me and spakest with me and that
I advised thee thus, let no one know or be aware. And about thy family and the inhabitants
of thy village, be not at all anxious: for no one will at all hurt them; but they will be in prison
a few days only, and then the governor will let them go: because against them the emperors
have not commanded anything serious or alarming. But, if on the contrary thou wilt not
be persuaded by me in regard to these things which I have said to thee, I am clear of thy
blood: because, if so be that thou appear before the judge of the country, thou wilt not escape
from death by fire, according to the command of the emperors which they have issued
concerning thee.</p>
<p>Habib said to Theotecna: It is not about my family and the inhabitants of my village
that I am concerned, but for my own salvation, lest it should be forfeited. About this too I
am much distressed, that I did not happen to be in my village on the day that the governor
inquired for me, and that on my account lo! many are put in irons, and I have been looked
upon by him as a fugitive. Therefore, if so be that thou wilt not consent to my request and
take me in before the governor, I will go alone and appear before him.</p>
<p>And, when Theotecna heard him speak thus to him, he laid hold of him firmly, and
handed him over to his assistants,3250 and they went together to conduct him to the judgment-
hall of the governor. And Theotecna went in and informed the governor, and said
to him: Habib of Telzeha, whom thine Excellency was inquiring for, is come. And the
governor said: Who is it that has brought him? and where did they find him? and what did
he do where he was? Theotecna said to him: He came hither himself, of his own accord,
and without the compulsion of any one, since no one knew anything about him.</p>
<p>And when the governor heard this, he was greatly exasperated against him; and thus he
spoke: This fellow, who has so acted, has shown great contempt towards me and has despised
me, and has accounted me as no judge; and, because he has so acted, it is not meet that any
mercy should be shown towards him; nor yet either that I should hasten to pass sentence
of death against him, according to the command of the emperors concerning him; but it is
meet for me to have patience with him, so that the bitter torments and punishments inflicted
on him may be the more abundant, and that through him I may terrify many others from
daring again to flee.</p>
<p>And, many persons being collected together and standing by him at the door of the
judgment-hall, some of whom were members of the body of attendants, and some people
of the city, there were some of them that said to him: Thou hast done badly in coming and
showing thyself to those who were inquiring for thee, without the compulsion of the judge;
and there were others, again, who said to him: Thou hast done well in coming and showing
thyself of thine own accord, rather than that the compulsion of the judge should bring thee:
<note type="footnote">3250 Or “domestics.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1903"/>
for now is thy confession of Christ known to be of thine own will, and not from the compulsion
of men.</p>
<p>And those things which the Sharirs of the city had heard from those who were speaking
to him as they stood at the door of the judgment-hall—and this circumstance also in particular,
that he had gone secretly to Theotecna and that he had not been willing to denounce
him, had been heard by the Sharirs of the city—everything that they had heard they made
known to the judge.</p>
<p>And the judge was enraged against those who had been saying to Habib: Wherefore
didst thou come and show thyself to the judge, without the compulsion of the judge himself?
And to Theotecna he said: It is not seemly for a man who has been made chief over his fellows
to act deceitfully in this manner towards his superior, and to set at nought the command
of the emperors, which they issued against Habib the rebel, that he should be burned with
fire.</p>
<p>Theotecna said: I have not acted deceitfully against my fellows, neither was it my purpose
to set at naught the command which the emperors have issued: for what am I before thine
Excellency, that I should have dared to do this? But I strictly questioned him as to that for
which thine Excellency also has demanded an account at my hands, that I might know and
see whether it was of his own free will that he came hither or whether the compulsion of
thine Excellency brought him by the hand of others; and, when I heard from him that he
came of his own accord, I carefully brought him to the honourable door of the judgmenthall
of thy Worship.3251</p>
<p>And the governor hastily commanded, and they brought in Habib before him. The officers
said: Lo! he standeth before thine Excellency,</p>
<p>And he began to question him thus, and said to him: What is thy name? And whence
art thou? And what art thou?</p>
<p>He said to him: My name is Habib, and I am from the village of Telzeha, and I have
been made a deacon.</p>
<p>The governor said: Wherefore hast thou transgressed the command of the emperors,
and dost minister in thine office of deacon, which thou art forbidden by the emperors to
do, and refusest to sacrifice to Zeus, whom the emperors worship?</p>
<p>Habib said: We are Christians; we do not worship the works of men, who are nothing,
whose works also are nothing; but we worship God, who made the men.</p>
<p>The governor said: Persist not in that daring mind with which thou art come into my
presence, and insult not Zeus, the great boast of the emperors.</p>
<p>Habib said: But this Zeus is an idol, the work of men. It is very well for thee to say that
I insult him. But, if the carving of him out of wood and the fixing of him with nails proclaim
<note type="footnote">3251 Lit. “rectitude.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1904"/>
aloud concerning him that he is made, how sayest thou to me that I insult him? since lo! his
insult is from himself, and against himself.</p>
<p>The governor said: By this very thing, that thou refusest to worship him, thou insultest
him.</p>
<p>Habib said: But, if because I do not worship him I insult him, how great an insult, then,
did the carpenter inflict on him, who carved him with an axe of iron; and the smith, who
smote him and fixed him with nails!</p>
<p>And, when the governor heard him speak thus he commanded him to be scourged
without pity. And, when he had been scourged by five men, he said to him: Wilt thou now
obey the emperors? For, if thou wilt not obey them, I will tear thee severely with combs,
and I will torture thee with all kinds of tortures, and then at last I will give command concerning
thee that thou be burned with fire.</p>
<p>Habib said: These threats with which lo! thou art seeking to terrify me, are much
meaner and paltrier than those which I had already settled it in my mind to endure: therefore3252
came I and made my appearance before thee.</p>
<p>The governor said: Put him into the iron cask3253 for murderers, and let him be scourged
as he deserves. And, when he had been scourged, they said to him: Sacrifice to the gods.
But he cried aloud, and said: Accursed are your idols, and so are they who join with you in
worshipping them like you.</p>
<p>And the governor commanded, and they took him up to the prison; but they refused
him permission to speak with his family, or with the inhabitants of his village, according to
the command of the judge. On that day was the festival of the emperors.</p>
<p>And on the second of Ilul the governor commanded, and they brought him from the
prison. And he said to him: Wilt thou renounce the profession thou hast made3254 and
obey the command which the emperors issue? For, if thou wilt not obey, with the bitter
tearings of combs will I make thee obey them.</p>
<p>Habib said: I have not obeyed them, and moreover it is settled in my mind that I will
not obey them—no, not even if thou lay upon me punishments still worse than those which
the emperors have commanded.</p>
<p>The governor said: By the gods I swear, that, if thou do not sacrifice, I will leave no
harsh and bitter sufferings untried with which I will not torture thee: and we shall see
whether Christ, whom thou worshippest, will deliver thee.</p>
<p>Habib said: All those who worship Christ are delivered through Christ, because they
worship not creatures along with the Creator of creatures.</p>

<pb n="1905"/>
<p>The governor said: Let him be stretched out and be scourged with whips, until there
remain not a place in his body on which he has not been scourged.</p>
<p>Habib said: As for these inflictions, which thou supposest to be so bitter with their lacerations,
3255 out of them are plaited crowns of victory for those who endure them.</p>
<p>The governor said: How call ye afflictions ease, and account the torments of your
bodies a crown of victory?
Habib said: It is not for thee to ask me concerning these things, because thine unbelief
is not worthy to hear the reasons of them. That I will not sacrifice I have said already, and
I say so still.</p>
<p>The governor said: Thou art subjected to these punishments because thou deservest
them: I will put out thine eyes, which look upon this Zeus and are not afraid of him; and I
will stop thine ears, which hear the laws of the emperors and tremble not.</p>
<p>Habib said: To the God whom thou deniest here belongs that other world; and there
wilt thou be made to confess Him with scourgings, though thou hast again denied Him.</p>
<p>The governor said: Leave alone that world of which thou hast spoken, and consider
anxiously now, that from this punishment to which lo! thou art being subjected there is no
one that can deliver thee; unless indeed the gods deliver thee, on thy sacrificing to them.</p>
<p>Habib said: Those who die for the sake of the name of Christ, and worship not those
objects that are made and created, will find their life in the presence of God;3256 but those
who love the life of time more than that—their torment will be for ever.</p>
<p>And the governor commanded, and they hanged him up and tore him with combs; and,
while they were tearing him with the combs, they knocked him about. And he was hanging
a long while, until the shoulder blades of his arms creaked.</p>
<p>The governor said to him: Wilt thou comply even now, and put on incense before Zeus
there?3257</p>
<p>Habib said: Previously to these sufferings I did not comply with thy demands: and now
that lo! I have undergone them, how thinkest thou that I shall comply, and thereby lose that
which I have gained by them?</p>
<p>The governor said: By punishments fiercer and bitterer than these I am prepared to
make thee obey, according to the command of the emperors, until thou do their will.</p>
<p>Habib said: Thou art punishing me for not obeying the command of the emperors,
when lo! thou thyself also, whom the emperors have raised to greatness and made a judge,
hast transgressed their command, in that thou hast not done to me that which the emperors
have commanded thee.</p>

<pb n="1906"/>
<p>The governor said: Because I have had patience with thee, therefore hast thou spoken
thus, like a man that brings an accusation.</p>
<p>Habib said: Hadst thou not scourged me, and bound me, and torn me with combs, and
put my feet in fetters,3258 there would have been room to think that thou hadst had patience
with me. But, if these things take place in the meanwhile, where is the patience towards me
of which thou hast spoken?</p>
<p>The governor said: These things which thou hast said will not help thee, because they
all go against thee, and they will bring upon thee inflictions bitterer even than those which
the emperors have commanded.</p>
<p>Habib said: Had I not been sensible that they would help me, I should not have spoken
a single word about them before thee.</p>
<p>The governor said: I will silence thy speeches, and at the same time as regards thee pacify
the gods, whom thou hast not worshipped; and I will satisfy the emperors in respect to
thee, as regards thy rebellion against their commands.</p>
<p>Habib said: I am not afraid of the death with which thou seekest to terrify me; for, had
I been afraid of it, I should not have gone about from house to house and ministered: on
which account I did so minister.3259</p>
<p>The governor said: How is it that thou worshippest and honourest a man, but refusest
to worship and honour Zeus there?</p>
<p>Habib said: I worship not a man, because the Scripture3260 teaches me,3261 “Cursed is
every one that putteth his trust in man;” but God, who took upon Him a body and became
a man, Him do I worship, and glorify.</p>
<p>The governor said: Do thou that which the emperors have commanded; and, as for that
which is in thy own mind, if thou art willing to give it up, well; but, if thou art not willing,
then do not abandon it.</p>
<p>Habib said: To do both these things is impossible: because falsehood is contrary to
truth, and it is impossible that that should be banished from my thoughts which is firmly
fixed in my mind.</p>
<p>The governor said: By inflictions bitter and severe will I make thee dismiss from thy
thoughts that of which thou hast said, It is firmly fixed in my mind.</p>
<p>Habib said: As for these inflictions by which thou thinkest that it will be rooted out of
my thoughts, by means of these it is that it grows within my thoughts, like a tree which bears
fruit.</p>

<pb n="1907"/>
<p>The governor said: What help will stripes and combs give to that tree of thine? and
more especially at the time when I shall command fire against it, to burn it up without pity.</p>
<p>Habib said: It is not on those things at which thou lookest that I look, because I contemplate
the things which are out of sight; and therefore I do the will of God, the Maker of all
things, and not that of an idol made with hands, which is not sensible of anything whatever.</p>
<p>The governor said: Because he thus denies the gods whom the emperors worship, let
him be torn with combs in addition to his former tearings: for, amidst the many questions
which I have had the patience to ask him, he has forgotten his former tearings.</p>
<p>And, while they were tearing him, he cried aloud and said: “The sufferings of this time
are not equal to that glory which shall be revealed in”3262 those who love Christ.</p>
<p>And, when the governor saw that even under these inflictions he refused to sacrifice,
he said to him: Does your doctrine so teach you, that you should hate your own bodies?</p>
<p>Habib said: Nay, we do not hate our bodies: the Scripture distinctly teaches us,
“Whosoever shall lose his life shall find it.”3263 But another thing too it teaches us: that we
should “not cast that which is holy to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine.”3264</p>
<p>The governor said: I know that in speaking thus thy sole object is that my rage and the
wrath of my mind may be excited, and that I may pronounce sentence of death against thee
speedily. I am not going, then, to be hurried on to that which thou desirest; but I will have
patience: not; indeed, for thy relief, but so that the tortures inflicted on thee may be increased,
and that thou mayest see thy flesh falling off before thy face by means of the combs that are
passing over thy sides.</p>
<p>Habib said: I myself also am looking for this, that thou shouldst multiply thy tortures
upon me, even as thou hast said.</p>
<p>The governor said: Submit to the emperors, who have power to do whatsoever they
choose.</p>
<p>Habib said: It is not of men to do whatsoever they choose, but of God, whose power is
in the heavens, and over all the dwellers upon earth; “nor is there any that may rebuke His
hands3265 and say to Him, ‘What doest Thou?’”</p>
<p>The governor said: For this insolence of thine, death by the sword is too small. I,
however, am prepared to command the infliction upon thee of a death more bitter than that
of the sword.</p>
<p>Habib said: And I, too, am looking for a death which is more lingering than that of the
sword, which thou mayest pronounce upon me at any time thou choosest.</p>

<pb n="1908"/>
<p>And thereupon the governor proceeded to pass sentence of death upon him. And he
called out aloud before his attendants, and said, whilst they were listening to him, as were
also the nobles of the city: This Habib, who has denied the gods, as ye have also heard from
him, and furthermore has reviled the emperors, deserves that his life should be blotted out
from beneath this glorious Sun, and that he should not any longer behold this luminary,
associate of gods; and, had it not been commanded by former emperors that the corpses of
murderers should be buried, it would not be right that the corpse of this fellow either should
be buried, because he has been so insolent. I command, that a strap be put into his mouth,
as into the mouth of a murderer, and that he be burned by a slow lingering fire, so that the
torment of his death may be increased.</p>
<p>And he went out from the presence of the governor, with the strap thrust into his mouth;
and a multitude of the people of the city ran after him. And the Christians were rejoicing,
forasmuch as he had not turned aside nor quitted his post;3266 but the pagans were threatening
him, for refusing to sacrifice. And they led him forth by the western archway, over
against the cemetery,3267 which was built by3268 Abshelama,3269 the son of Abgar. And his
mother was clad in white, and she went out with him.</p>
<p>And, when he was arrived at the place where they were going to burn him, he stood up
and prayed, as did all those who came out with him; and he said: “O King Christ, since
Thine is this world, and Thine the world to come, behold and see, that, while I might have
fled from these afflictions, I did not flee, in order that I might not fall into the hands of Thy
justice: may this fire, in which I am to be burned, serve me for a recompense before Thee,
so that I may be delivered from that fire which is not quenched; and receive Thou my spirit
into Thy presence, through Thy Divine Spirit, O glorious Son of the adorable Father!” And,
when he had prayed, he turned and blessed them; and they weeping gave him the salutation,
both men and women; and they said to him: Pray for us in the presence of thy Lord, that
He would cause peace among His people, and restoration to His churches which are overthrown.</p>
<p>And, while Habib was standing, they dug a place, and brought him and set him within
it; and they fixed up by him a stake. And they came to bind him to the stake; but he said to
them: I will not stir from this place in which ye are going to burn me. And they brought
fagots, and set them in order, and placed them on all sides of him. And, when the fire blazed
up and the flame of it rose fiercely, they called out to him: Open thy mouth. And the moment

<pb n="1909"/>
he opened his mouth his soul mounted up. And they cried aloud, both men and women,
with the voice of weeping.</p>
<p>And they pulled and drew him out of the fire, throwing over him fine linen cloths and
choice ointments and spices. And they snatched away some of the pieces of wood which
had been put for his burning, and the brethren and some persons of the laity3270 bore him
away. And they prepared him for interment, and buried him by Guria and Shamuna the
martyrs, in the same grave in which they were laid, on the hill which is called Baith Allah
Cucla,3271 repeating over him psalms and hymns, and conveying his burnt body affectionately
and honourably to the grave. And even some of the Jews and pagans took part with the
Christian brethren in winding up and burying his body. At the time, too, when he was
burned, and also at the time when he was buried, there was one spectacle of grief over
spreading those within and those without; tears, too, were running down from all eyes:
while every one gave glory to God, because for His name’s sake he had given his body to
the burning of fire.</p>
<p>The day on which he was burned was the eve of the Sabbath,3272 the second of the month
Ilul—the day on which the news came that Constantine the Great had set out from the interior
of Spain, to proceed to Rome, the city of Italy, that he might carry on war with Licinius,
that emperor who at this day rules over the eastern portion of the territories of the Romans;
and lo! the countries on all sides are in commotion, because no man knows which of them
will conquer and continue in his imperial power. And through this report the persecution
slackened for a little while from the Church.</p>
<p>And the notaries wrote down everything which they had heard from the judge; and the
Sharirs of the city wrote down all the other things which were spoken outside the door of
the judgment-hall, and, according to the custom that existed, they reported to the judge all
that they had seen and all that they had heard, and the decisions of the judge were written
down in their Acts.</p>
<p>I, Theophilus, who have renounced the evil inheritance of my fathers, and confessed
Christ, carefully wrote out a copy of these Acts of Habib, even as I had formerly written out
those of Guria and Shamuna,3273 his fellow-martyrs. And, whereas he had felicitated them
upon their death by the sword, he himself also was made like them by the fire in which he

was burnt, and received his crown. And, whereas I have written down the year, and the
month, and the day, of the coronation of these martyrs, it is not for the sake of those who,
like me, were spectators of the deed, but with the view that those who come after us may
learn at what time these martyrs suffered, and what manner of men they were; as they may
learn also from the Acts of the former martyrs, who suffered in the days of Domitianus and
of all the other emperors who likewise also raised a persecution against the Church, and put
a great many to death, by stripes and by tearing with combs, and by bitter inflictions, and
by sharp swords, and by burning fire, and by the terrible sea, and by the merciless mines.
And all these things, and things like them, they suffered for the hope of the recompense to
come.</p>
<p>Moreover, the afflictions of these martyrs, and of those of whom I had heard, opened
the eyes of me, Theophilus, and enlightened my mind, and I confessed Christ, that He is
the Son of God, and is God. And may the dust of the feet of these martyrs, which I received
as I was running after them at the time when they were departing to be crowned, procure
me pardon for having denied Him, and may He confess me before His worshippers, seeing
that I have confessed Him now!</p>
<p>And at the twenty-seventh question which the judge put to Habib, he gave sentence
against him of death by the burning of fire.</p>

<p>Martyrdom3274 of the Holy Confessors Shamuna, Guria, and Habib,
from Simeon Metaphrastes.3275</p>
<p>In the six hundredth year from the empire of Alexander the Macedonian, when Diocletian
had been nine years sovereign of the Romans, and Maximian was consul for the sixth
time, and Augar son of Zoaras was prætor, and Cognatus was bishop of the Edessenes, a
great persecution was raised against the churches in all the countries which were under the
sway of the Romans. The name of Christian was looked upon as execrable, and was assailed
and harassed with abuse; while the priests and the monks,3276 on account of their staunch
and unconquerable stedfastness, were subjected to shocking punishments, and the pious
were at their wits’ end with sadness and fear. For, desiring as they did to proclaim the truth
because of their yearning affection for Christ, they yet shrunk back from doing so for fear
of punishment. For those who took up arms against true religion were bent on making the
Christians renounce Christianity and embrace the cause of Saturn and Rhea, whilst the
faithful on their part laboured to prove that the objects of heathen worship had no real existence.</p>
<p>At this period it was that an accusation was preferred before the judge against Guria
and Shamuna. The former was a native of Sarcigitua, and the latter of the village of Ganas;
they were, however, both brought up at Edessa—which they call Mesopotamia, because it
is situated between the Euphrates and the Tigris: a city previously to this but little known
to fame, but which after the struggles of its martyrs obtained universal notoriety. These
holy men would not by any means spend their lives in the city, but removing to a distance
from it, as those who wished to be remote from its turmoils, they made it their aim to be
manifest to God only. Guria’s purity and lovingness were to him a precious and honourable
possession, and from his cultivation of the former the surname of the pure was given him:
so that from his name you would not have known who he was, but only when you called
him by his surname. Shamuna devoted his body and his youthful and active mind to the
service of God, and rivalled Guria in excellence of character. Against these men an indictment

was laid before the judge, to the effect that they not only pervaded all the country round
about Edessa with their teaching and encouraged the people to hold fast their faith, but also
led them to look with contempt on their persecutors, and, in order to induce them to set
wholly at nought their impiety, taught them agreeably to that which is written: “Trust not
in princes—in the sons of men, in whom is no safety.”3277 By these representations the
judge was wrought up to a high pitch of madness, and gave orders that all those who held
the Christian religion in honour and followed the teaching of Shamuna and Guria, together
with those who persuaded them to this, should be apprehended, and shut up in safe keeping.
The order was carried into effect; and, seizing the opportunity, he had some of them flogged,
and others tortured in various ways, and induced them to obey the emperor’s command,
and then, as if he were behaving kindly and mercifully, he allowed others to go to their
homes; but our two saints, as being the ringleaders and those who had communicated their
piety to others, he ordered to be still further maltreated in prison. They, however, rejoiced
in the fellowship of martyrdom. For they heard of many in other provinces who had to pass
through the same conflict as themselves: among them Epiphanius and Petrus and the most
holy Pamphilus, with many others, at Cæsarea in Palestine; Timotheus at Gaza; at Alexandria,
Timotheus the Great; Agapetus at Thessalonica; Hesychius at Nicomedia; Philippus at Ad-
rianopolis; at Melitina Petrus; Hermes and his companions in the confines of Martyropolis:
all of whom were also encircled with the crown of martyrdom by Duke3278 Heraclianus,
along with other confessors too numerous for us to become acquainted with. But we must
return to the matters of which we were before speaking.</p>
<p>Antonius, then, the governor of Edessa, having permitted others to return to their
homes, had a lofty judgment-seat erected, and ordered the martyrs to be brought before
him. The attendants having done as they were bidden, the governor said to the saints: Our
most divine emperor commands you to renounce Christianity, of which you are followers,
and to pay divine honour to Jupiter by offering incense on the altar. To this Shamuna
replied: Far be it from us to abandon the true faith, whereby we hope to obtain immortality,
and worship the work of men’s hands and an image! The governor said: The emperor’s
orders must by all means be obeyed. Guria answered: Our pure and divine faith will we
never disown, by following the will of men, who are subject to dissolution. For we have a
Father in heaven whose will we follow, and He says: “He that shall confess Me before men,
him will I also confess before My Father who is in heaven; but he that shall deny Me before
men, him will I also deny before My Father and His angels.”3279 The judge said: You refuse,
then, to obey the will of the emperor? But can you for a moment think, that the purposes

<pb n="1913"/>
of ordinary men and such as have no more power than yourselves are to be really carried
into execution, while the commands of those who possess supreme power fall to the ground?
They, said the saints, who do the will of the King of kings spurn and reject the will of the
flesh. Then, on the governor’s threatening them with death unless they obeyed, Shamuna
said: We shall not die, O tyrant, if we follow the will of the Creator: nay rather, on the
contrary, we shall live; but, if we follow the commands of your emperor, know thou that,
even though thou shouldest not put us to death, we shall perish miserably all the same.</p>
<p>On hearing this, the governor gave orders to Anovitus the jailor to put them in very
safe keeping. For the mind which is naturally inclined to evil cannot bear the truth, any
more than diseased eyes the bright beams of the sun. And, when he had done as he was
commanded, and the martyrs were in prison, where many other saints also had been previously
shut by the soldiers, the Emperor Diocletian sent for Musonius the governor of Antioch
and ordered him to go to Edessa and see the Christians who were confined there, whether
they were of the common or of the sacred class, and question them about their religion, and
deal with them as he should see fit. So he came to Edessa; and he had Shamuna and Guria
first of all placed before the tribunal of judgment, and said to them: This, and no less, is the
command of the lord of the world, that you make a libation of wine and place incense on
the altar of Jupiter. If you refuse to do so, I will destroy you with manifold punishments:
for I will tear your bodies to pieces with whips, till I get to your very entrails; and I will not
cease pouring boiling lead into your armpits until it reaches even to your bowels; after that,
I will hang you up, now by your hands, now by your feet, and I will loosen the fastenings of
your joints; and I will invent new and unheard of punishments which you will be utterly
unable to endure.</p>
<p>Shamuna answered: We dread “the worm,” the threat of which is denounced against
those who deny the Lord, and “the fire which is not quenched,” more than those tortures
which thou hast set before us. For God Himself, to whom we offer rational worship, will,
first of all, strengthen us to bear these manifold tortures, and will deliver us out of thy hands;
and, after that, will also give us to rest in a place of safety, where is the abode of all those
who rejoice. Besides, it is against nothing whatever but the body that thou takest up arms:
for what possible harm couldst thou do to the soul? since, as long as it resides in the body,
it proves superior to torture; and, when it takes its departure, the body has no feeling whatever
left. For, “the more our outward man is destroyed, the more is our inward man renewed
day by day;”3280 for by means of patience we go through with this contest which is set before
us. The governor, however, again, with a kind of protestation, in order that, in case they
did not obey, he might with the more justice punish them, said: Give up your error, I beg
you, and yield to the command of the emperor: ye will not be able to endure the tortures.
<note type="footnote">3280 2 Cor. iv. 16.—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1914"/>
The holy Guria answered: We are neither the slaves of error, as thou sayest, nor will we
ever obey the command of the emperor: God forbid that we should be so weak-minded
and so senseless! For we are His disciples who laid down His life for us, so manifesting the
riches of His goodness and His love towards us. We will, therefore, resist sin even to death,
nor, come what may, will we be foiled by the stratagems of the adversary, by which the first
man was ensnared and plucked death from the tree through his disobedience;3281 and Cain
was persuaded, and, after staining his hands with his brother’s blood, found the rewards of
sin to be wailing and fear. But we, listening to the words of Christ, will “not be afraid of
those that kill the body but are not able to kill the soul:” Him rather will we fear “who is
able to destroy our soul and body.”3282 The tyrant said: It is not to give you an opportunity
of disproving my allegations by snatches of your own writings that I refrain from anger and
show myself forbearing; but that you may perform the command of the emperor and return
in peace to your homes.</p>
<p>These words did not at all shake the resolution of the martyrs; but, approaching nearer:
What, said they, does it matter to us, if thou art angry, and nursest thine anger, and rainest
tortures upon us like snow-flakes? For then wouldst thou be favouring us all the more, by
rendering the proof of our fortitude more conspicuous, and winning for us a greater recompense.
For this is the crowning point of our hope, that we shall leave behind our present
dwelling, which is but for a time, and depart to one that will last forever. For we have “a
tabernacle not made with hands”3283 in heaven, which the Scripture is accustomed also to
call “Abraham’s bosom,” because of the familiar intercourse with God with which he was
blessed. The governor, seeing that their firmness underwent no change, forthwith left off
speaking and proceeded with the threatened punishments, giving orders to the jailor Anuinus
that they should be severally hung up by one hand, and that, when their hands were dislocated
by having to bear the entire weight of the body, he should further suspend a heavy stone to
their feet, that the sense of pain might be the sharper. This was done, and from the third
hour to the eighth they bore this severe torture with fortitude, uttering not a word, nor a
groan, nor giving any other indication of a weak or abject mind. You would have said that
they were suffering in a body which was not theirs, or that others were suffering and they
themselves were nothing more than spectators of what was going on.</p>
<p>In the meantime, whilst they were hanging by their hands, the governor was engaged
in trying other cases. Having done with these, he ordered the jailor to inquire of the saints
<note type="footnote">3281 Or “through his disobedience in the matter of the tree,” if per ligni inobedientiam are the real words of
the Latin translator, who is not, generally speaking, to be complimented for elegance or even correctness, but

<pb n="1915"/>
whether or not they would obey the emperor and be released from their torture; and on his
putting the question to them, when it was found that they either could not or would not
return an answer, he ordered that they should be confined in the inner part of the prison,
in a dark dungeon, dark both in name and in reality, and that their feet should be made fast
in the stocks. At dawn of day, their feet were loosened from the confinement of the stocks;
but their prison was close shut up, so that not a single ray even of sunlight could make its
way in; and the jailors were ordered not to give them a bit of bread or a single drop of water
for three whole days. So that, in addition to all the rest, the martyrs were condemned to a
dark prison and a long privation of food. When the third day arrived, about the beginning
of the month of August, the prison was opened to admit light, but they were detained in it
still up to the 10th of November. Then the judge had them brought up before his tribunal:
Has not all this time, said he, sufficed to induce you to change your minds and come to
some wholesome decision? They answered: We have already several times told thee our
mind: do, therefore, what thou hast been commanded. The governor forthwith ordered
that Shamuna should be made to kneel down on one side3284 and that an iron chain should
be fastened on his knee. This having been done, he hung him up head downwards by the
foot with which he had made him kneel; the other he pulled downwards with a heavy piece
of iron, which cannot be described in words: thus endeavouring to rend the champion in
twain. By this means the socket of the hip-bone was wrenched out of its place and Shamuna
became lame. Guria, however, because he was weak and somewhat pale, he left unpunished:
not that he regarded him with friendly eyes—not that he had any compassion on his weakness;
but rather by way of sparing for another opportunity one whom he was anxious to
punish: lest perchance, as he said, through inadvertence on my part he should be worn out
before he has undergone the torments in reserve for him.</p>
<p>By this time two hours of the day had passed since Shamuna had been hung up; and
the fifth hour had now arrived, and he was still suspended on high—when the soldiers who
stood around, taking pity upon him, urged him to obey the emperor’s command. But the
compassion of sinners had no effect upon the saint. For, although he suffered bitterly from
the torture, he vouchsafed them no answer whatever, leaving them to lament at their leisure,
and to deem themselves rather, and not him, deserving of pity. But, lifting his eyes to
heaven, he prayed to God from the depth of his heart, reminding Him of the wonders done
in old time: Lord God, he said, without whom not even a poor little sparrow falls into the
snare; who didst cheer the heart of David amid his afflictions; who gavest power to Daniel
even against the lions; who madest the children of Abraham victorious over the tyrant and
the flame: do Thou now also, O Lord, look on the war which is being waged against us, ac-
<note type="footnote">3284 Lit. “with one foot.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1916"/>
quainted as Thou art with the weakness of our nature. For the enemy is trying to turn away
the workmanship of Thy right hand from the glory which is with Thee. But regard Thou
us with looks of compassion, and maintain within us, against all attempts to extinguish it,
the lamp of Thy commandments; and by Thy light guide our paths, and vouchsafe us the
enjoyment of that happiness which is in Thee: for Thou art blessed for ever, world without
end. Thus did he utter the praise of the Umpire of the strife; and a scribe who was present
took down in writing what was said.</p>
<p>At length the governor ordered the jailor to release him from his punishment. He did
so, and carried him away all faint and exhausted with the pain he suffered, and they bore
him back to his former prison and laid him down by the side of the holy Guria. On the 15th
of November, however, in the night, about the time of cock-crowing, the judge got up. He
was preceded by torches and attendants; and, on arriving at the Basilica, as it is called, where
the court was held, he took his seat with great ceremony on the tribunal, and sent to fetch
the champions Guria and Shamuna. The latter came in walking between two of the jailors
and supported by the hands of both: for he was worn out with hunger and weighed down
with age: nothing but his good hope sustained him. Guria, too, had also to be carried in:
for he could not walk at all, because his foot had been severely galled by the chain on it.
Addressing them both, the advocate of impiety said: In pursuance of the permission which
was granted, you have, doubtless, consulted together about what it is expedient for you to
do. Tell me, then, whether any fresh resolution has been come to by you, and whether you
have in any respect changed your mind in regard to your former purpose; and obey the
command of the most divine emperor. For thus will you be restored to the enjoyment of
your property and possessions, yea of this most cheering light also. To this the martyrs
reply: No one who is wise would make any great account of continuing for a little while in
the enjoyment of things which are but transient. Sufficient for us is the time already past
for the use and the sight of them; nor do we feel the want of any of them. That death, on
the contrary, with which thou art threatening us will convey us to imperishable habitations
and give us a participation in the happiness which is yonder.</p>
<p>The governor replied: What you have said has filled my ears with great sadness.
However, I will explain to you what is determined on: if you place incense on the altar and
sacrifice to the image of Jupiter, all will be well, and each of you will go away to his home;
but, if you still persist in disobeying the command of the emperor, you will most certainly
lose your heads: for this is what the great emperor wills and determines. To this the most
noble-minded Shamuna replied: If thou shalt confer upon us so great a favour as to grant
us deliverance from the miseries of this life and dismissal to the happiness of the life yonder,
so far as in us lies thou shalt be rewarded by Him who lays out our possessions on what is
for our good. The governor replied to this somewhat kindly, as it seemed, saying: I have
patiently endured hitherto, putting up with those long speeches of yours, in order that by

<pb n="1917"/>
delay you may change your purpose and betake yourselves to what is for your good, and
not have to undergo the punishment of death. Those who submit, said he, to death which
is only for a time, for the sake of Christ, will manifestly be delivered from eternal death.
For those who die to the world live in Christ. For Peter also, who shines so brightly among
the band of apostles, was condemned to the cross and to death; and James, the son of
thunder was slain by Herod Agrippa with the sword. Moreover, Stephen also was stoned,
who was the first to run the course of martyrdom. What, too, wilt thou say of John the
Baptist? Thou wilt surely acknowledge his distinguished fortitude and boldness of speech,
when he preferred death rather than keep silence about conjugal infidelity, and the adulteress
received his head as a reward for her dancing?</p>
<p>Again the governor said: It is not that you may reckon up your saints, as you call them,
that I bear so patiently with you, but that, by changing your resolution and yielding to the
emperor’s commands, you may be rescued from a very bitter death. For, if you behave with
such excessive daring and arrogance, what can you expect but that severer punishments are
in store for you, under the pressure of which you will be ready even against your will to do
what I demand of you: by which time, however, it will be altogether too late to take refuge
in compassion? For the cry which is wrung from you by force has no power to challenge
pity; whilst, on the other hand, that which is made of your own accord is deserving of
compassion. The confessors and martyrs of Christ said: There needs not many words. For
lo! we are ready to undergo all the punishments thou mayest lay upon us. What, therefore,
has been commanded thee, delay not to perform. For we are the worshippers of Christ the
true God, and (again we say it) of Him of whose kingdom there shall be no end; who also
is alone able to glorify those in return who glorify His name. In the meantime, whilst these
things were being said by the saints, the governor pronounced sentence against them that
they should suffer death by the sword. But they, filled with a joy, beyond the power of words
to express, exclaimed: To Thee of right belongeth glory and praise, who art God of all, be-
cause it hath pleased Thee that we should carry on to its close the conflict we have entered
upon, and that we should also receive at Thy hands the brightness that shall never fade away.</p>
<p>When, therefore, the governor saw their unyielding firmness, and how they had heard
the final sentence with exultation of soul, he said to the saints: May God search into what
is being done, and be witness that so far as I was concerned it was no wish of mine that you
should lose your lives; but the inflexible command of the emperor to me compels me to
this. He then ordered a halberdier to take charge of the martyrs, and, putting them in a
carriage, to convey them to a distance from the city with some soldiers, and there to end
them with the sword. So he, taking the saints out at night by the Roman gate, when the
citizens were buried in profound slumber, conveyed them to Mount Bethelabicla on the
north of the city. On their arrival at that place, having alighted from the carriage with joy
of heart and great firmness of mind, they requested the halberdier and those who were under

<pb n="1918"/>
his orders to give them time to pray; and it was granted. For, just as if their tortures and
their blood were not enough to plead for them, they still by reason of their humility deemed
it necessary to pray. So they raised their eyes to heaven and prayed earnestly, concluding
with the words: God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, receive in peace our spirits to
Thyself. Then Shamuna, turning to the halberdier, said: Perform that which thou hast been
commanded. So he kneeled down along with Guria, and they were beheaded, on the 15th
of November. This is the account of what happened to the martyrs.</p>
<p>But forasmuch as the number sought for a third in order that in them the Trinity might
be glorified, it found, oh admirable providence! Habib—at a subsequent time indeed: but
he also, along with those who had preceded him, had determined to enter on the journey,
and on the very day3285 of their martyrdom reached his consummation. Habib, then, great
among martyrs, was a native of the same place as they, namely of the village of Thelsæa;3286
and he had the honour of being invested with the sacred office of the diaconate. But, when
Licinius swayed the sceptre of the Roman empire and Lysanias had appointed governor of
Edessa, a persecution was again raised against the Christians, and the general danger
threatened Habib. For he would go about the city, teaching the divine Scriptures to all he
met with, and courageously seeking to strengthen them in piety. When this came to the
ears of Lysanias, he gave information of it to the Emperor Licinius. For he was anxious to
be himself entrusted with the business of bringing the Christians to trial, and especially
Habib: for he had never been entrusted with it before. The emperor, then, sent him a letter
and commanded him to put Habib to death. So, when Lysanias had received the letter,
search was made everywhere for Habib, who on account of his office in the Church lived
in some part of the city, his mother and some of his relations residing with him. When he
got intelligence of the matter, fearing lest he should incur punishment for quitting the ranks
of martyrdom, he went of his own accord and presented himself to a man who was among
the chief of the body-guard, named Theotecnus, and presently he said: I am Habib for
whom ye are seeking. But he, looking kindly at him, said: No one, my good man, is as yet
aware of thy coming to me: so go away, and look to thy safety; and be not concerned about
thy mother, nor about thy relations: for they cannot possibly get into any trouble. Thus
far Theotecnus.</p>
<p>But Habib, because the occasion was one that called for martyrdom, refused to yield to
a weak and cowardly spirit and secure his safety in any underhand way. He replied, therefore:
It is not for the sake of my dear mother, nor for the sake of my kinsfolk, that I denounce
myself; but I have come for the sake of the confession of Christ. For Lo! whether thou
consent or no, I will make my appearance before the governor, and I will proclaim my
<note type="footnote">3285 i.e., the anniversary.—Tr.</note>
<note type="footnote">3286 In the Syriac account “Telzeha:” see p. 690, supra.—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1919"/>
Master Christ before princes and kings. Theotecnus, accordingly, apprehensive that he
might go of his own accord to the governor, and that in this way he might himself be in
jeopardy for not having denounced him, took Habib and conducted him to the governor:
Here, said he, is Habib, for whom search has been made. When Lysanias learned that Habib
had come of his own accord to the contest, he concluded that this was a mark of contempt
and overweening boldness, as if he set light by the solemn dignity of the judicial seat; and
he had him at once put on his trial. He inquired of him his condition of life, his name, and
his country. On his answering that he was a native of the village of Thelsæa, and intimating
that he was a minister of Christ, the governor immediately charged the martyr with not
obeying the emperor’s commands. He insisted that a plain proof of this was his refusal to
offer incense to Jupiter. To this Habib kept replying that he was a Christian, and could not
forsake the true God, or sacrifice to the lifeless works of men’s hands which had no sensation.
The governor hereupon ordered, that his arms should be bound with ropes, and that he
should be raised up high on a beam and torn with iron claws.3287 The hanging up was far
more difficult to bear than the tearing: for he was in danger of being pulled asunder, through
the forcible strain with which his arms were stretched out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as he was hanging up in the air, the governor had recourse to smooth
words, and assumed the guise of patience. He, however, continued to threaten him with
severer punishments unless he should change his resolution. But he said: No man shall
induce me to forsake the faith, nor persuade me to worship demons, even though he should
inflict tortures more and greater. On the governor’s asking him what advantage he expected
to gain from tortures which destroyed his whole3288 body, Habib, Christ’s martyr, replied:
The objects of our regard do not last merely for the present, nor do we pursue the things
that are seen; and, if thou too art minded to turn thy look towards our hope and promised
recompense, possibly thou wilt even say with Paul: “The sufferings of this time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which is to be revealed in us.”3289 The governor
pronounced his words to be the language of imbecility; and, when he saw that, notwithstanding
all the efforts he made, by turns using smooth words and assuming the part of patience,
and then again threatening him and menacing him with a shocking3290 death, he could not
in either way prevail with him, he said, as he pronounced sentence upon him: I will not
inflict on thee a sudden and speedy death; I will bring on thy dissolution gradually by means
of a slow fire, and in this way make thee lay aside thy fierce and intractable spirit. Thereupon,
some wood was collected together at a place outside the city on the northward, and he was
<note type="footnote">3287 Compare the “combs” of the Syriac, p. 684, supra.—Tr.</note>
<note type="footnote">3288 Reading “totum” for “solum.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1920"/>
led to the pile, followed by his mother, and also by those who were otherwise by blood related
to him. He then prayed, and pronounced a blessing on all, and gave them the kiss in the
Lord; and after that the wood was kindled by them, and he was cast into the fire; and, when
he had opened his mouth to receive the flame, he yielded up his spirit to Him who had given
it. Then, when the fire had subsided, his relatives wrapped him in a costly piece of linen
and anointed him with unguents; and, having suitably sung psalms and hymns, they laid
him by the side of Shamuna and Guria, to the glory of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit, who constitute a Divine Trinity, which cannot be divided: to whom is due
honour and worship now and always, and for evermore, Amen. Such was the close of the
life of the martyr Habib in the time of Licinius, and thus did he obtain the privilege of being
laid with the saints, and thus did he bring to the pious rest from their persecutions. For
shortly afterwards the power of Licinius waned, and the rule of Constantine prospered, and
the sovereignty of the Romans became his; and he was the first of the emperors who openly
professed piety, and allowed the Christians to live as Christians.</p>

<head>I.3292</head>
<p>Reign of Abgar; Armenia becomes completely tributary to the Romans; war with Herod’s
troops; his brother’s son, Joseph, is killed.</p>
<p>Abgar, son of Archam, ascends the throne in the twentieth year of Archavir, king of the
Persians. This Abgar was called Avak-air (great man), on account of his great gentleness
and wisdom, and also on account of his size. Not being able to pronounce well, the Greeks
and the Syrians called him Abgar. In the second year of his reign, all the districts of Armenia
become tributary to the Romans. A command is given by the Emperor Augustus, as we are
told in the Gospel of St. Luke, to number all the people in every part. Roman commissioners,
sent for that purpose into Armenia, carried thither the statue of the Emperor Augustus, and
set it up in all the temples. At this very time, our Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came
into the world.</p>
<p>At the same period there was trouble between Abgar and Herod: for Herod wished that
his statue should be erected near to that of Cæsar in the temples of Armenia. Abgar withstood
this claim. Moreover, Herod was but seeking a pretext to attack Abgar: he sent an army of
Thracians and Germans to make an incursion into the country of the Persians, with orders
to pass through the territories of Abgar. But Abgar, far from submitting to this, resisted,
saying that the emperor’s command was to march the troops into Persia through the desert.
Herod, indignant, and unable to act by himself, overwhelmed with troubles, as a punishment
for his wicked conduct towards Christ, as Josephus relates, sent his nephew to whom he
had given his daughter, who had been married in the first instance to Phéror, his brother.
Herod’s lieutenant, at the head of a considerable army, hastened to reach Mesopotamia,
met Abgar at the camp in the province of Pouknan, fell in the combat, and his troops were
put to flight. Soon afterwards, Herod died: Archelaus, his son, was appointed by Augustus
ethnarch of Judæa.</p>

<p>Founding of the town of Edessa; brief account of the race of our illuminator.</p>
<p>A little while afterwards, Augustus dies, and Tiberius becomes emperor of the Romans
in his stead. Germanicus, having become Cæsar, dragging in his train the princes of the
kingdom of Archavir and of Abgar, celebrates a triumph in respect of the war waged with
them, in which these princes had killed Herod’s nephew. Abgar, indignant, forms plans of
revolt and prepares himself for combat. He builds a town on the ground occupied by the
Armenian army of observation, where previously the Euphrates had been defended against
the attempts of Cassius: this new town is called Edessa. Abgar removed to it his court,
which was at Medzpine, all his gods, Naboc, Bel, Patnicagh, and Tarata, the books of the
schools attached to the temples, and even the royal archives.</p>
<p>After this, Archavir being dead, Ardachès, his son, reigns over the Persians. Though it
is not in the order of the history with respect to time, nor even the order according to which
we have begun these annals, yet, as we are treating of descendants of the king Archavir, even
of the blood of Ardachès his son, we will, to do honour to these princes, place them, by anticipating
the time, near to Ardachès, in order that the reader may know that they are of the
same race, of the race of the brave Archag; then we will indicate the time of the arrival of
their fathers in Armenia, the Garenians and the Sourenians, from whom St. Gregory and
the Gamsarians are descended, when, following the order of events, we come to the reign
of the king under whom they appeared.</p>
<p>Abgar did not succeed in his plans of revolt; for, troubles having arisen amongst his
relatives in the Persian kingdom, he set out at the head of an army to allay and bring to an
end the dissension.</p>

<p>Abgar comes into the East, maintains Ardachès upon the throne of Persia; reconciles his
brothers from whom our illuminator and his relations are descended.</p>
<p>Abgar, having gone to the East, finds on the throne of Persia Ardachès, son of Archavir,
and the brothers of Ardachès contending against him: for this prince thought to reign over
them in his posterity, and they would not consent to it. Ardachès therefore hems them in
on all sides, hangs the sword of death over their heads; distractions and dissension were
between their troops and their other relations and allies: for King Archavir had three sons
and one daughter; the first of these sons was King Ardachès himself, the second Garene,
the third Sourene; their sister, named Gochm, was wife of the general of all the Ariks, a
general chosen by their father Archavir.</p>
<p>Abgar prevails on the sons of Archavir to make peace; he arranges between them the
conditions and stipulations: Ardachès is to reign with his posterity as he proposed, and his
brothers are to be called Bahlav, from the name of their town and their vast and fertile
country, so that their satrapies shall be the first, higher in rank than all the satrapies of Persia,
as being truly a race of kings. Treaties and oaths stipulated that in case of the extinction of
male children of Ardachès, his brothers should come to the throne; after the reigning race
of Ardachès, his brothers are divided into three races named thus: the race of Garene Bahlav,
the race of Sourene Bahlav, and the race of their sister, the race of Asbahabied Bahlav, a race
thus called from the name of the domain of her husband.</p>
<p>St. Gregory is said to have sprung from the race Sourene Bahlav, and the Gamsarians
from the race Garene Bahlav. We will relate in the sequel the circumstances of the coming
of these personages, only mentioning their names here in connection with Ardachès, in
order that you may know that these great races are indeed the blood of Vagharchag, that is
to say, the posterity of the great Archag, brother of Vagharchag.</p>
<p>Everything being thus arranged, Abgar takes with him the letter of the treaties, and returns
to his dominions; not in perfect health, but a prey to severe suffering.</p>

<p>Abgar returns from the east; he gives help to Aretas in a war against Herod the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>When Abgar had returned from the East, he learnt that the Romans suspected him of
having gone there to raise troops. He therefore made the Roman commissioners acquainted
with the reasons of his journey to Persia, as well as the treaty concluded between Ardachès
and his brothers; but no credence was given to his statement: for he was accused by his
enemies Pilate, Herod the tetrarch, Lysanias and Philip. Abgar having returned to his city
Edessa leagued himself with Aretas, king of Petra, and gave him some auxiliary troops under
the command of Khosran Ardzrouni, to make war upon Herod. Herod had in the first instance
married the daughter of Aretas, then had repudiated her, and thereupon taken
Herodias, even in her husband’s lifetime, a circumstance in connection with which he had
had John the Baptist put to death. Consequently there was war between Herod and Aretas
on account of the wrong done the daughter of Aretas. Being sharply attacked, Herod’s
troops were defeated, thanks to the help of the brave Armenians; as if, by divine providence,
vengeance was taken for the death of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>Abgar sends princes to Marinus; these deputies see our Saviour Christ; beginning of the conversion
of Abgar.</p>
<p>At this period Marinus, son of Storoge, was raised by the emperor to the government
of Phoenicia, Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia. Abgar sent to him two of his principal officers,
Mar-Ihap prince of Aghtznik, and Chamchacram chief of the house of the Abahouni,
as well as Anan his confidant. The envoys proceed to the town of Petkoupine to make
known to Marinus the reasons of Abgar’s journey to the East, showing him the treaty concluded
between Ardachès and his brothers, and at the same time to call upon Marinus for
his support. The deputies found the Roman governor at Eleutheropolis; he received them
with friendship and distinction, and gave this answer to Abgar: “Fear nothing from the
emperor on that account, provided you take good care to pay the tribute regularly.”</p>
<p>On their return, the Armenian deputies went to Jerusalem to see our Saviour the Christ,
being attracted by the report of His miracles. Having themselves become eye-witnesses of
these wonders, they related them to Abgar. This prince, seized with admiration, believed
truly that Jesus was indeed the Son of God, and said: “These wonders are not those of a
man, but of a God. No, there is no one amongst men who can raise the dead: God alone
has this power.” Abgar felt in his whole body certain acute pains which he had got in Persia,
more than seven years before; from men he had received no remedy for his sufferings; Abgar
sent a letter of entreaty to Jesus: he prayed Him to come and cure him of his pains. Here
is this letter:—</p>

<p>Abgar’s letter to the Saviour Jesus Christ.
“Abgar, son of Archam, prince of the land, to Jesus, Saviour and Benefactor of men,
who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting:—</p>
<p>“I have heard of Thee, and of the cures wrought by Thy hands, without remedies, without
herbs: for, as it is said, Thou makest the blind to see, the lame to walk, the lepers to be
healed; Thou drivest out unclean spirits, Thou curest unhappy beings afflicted with prolonged
and inveterate diseases; Thou dost even raise the dead. As I have heard of all these wonders
wrought by Thee, I have concluded from them either that Thou art God, come down from
heaven to do such great things, or that Thou art the Son of God, working as Thou dost these
miracles. Therefore have I written to Thee, praying Thee to condescend to come to me and
cure me of the complaints with which I am afflicted. I have heard also that the Jews murmur
against Thee and wish to deliver Thee up to torments: I have a city small but pleasant, it
would be sufficient for us both.”</p>
<p>The messengers, the bearers of this letter, met Jesus at Jerusalem, a fact confirmed by
these words of the Gospel: “Some from amongst the heathen came to find Jesus, but those
who heard them, not daring to tell Jesus what they had heard, told it to Philip and Andrew,
who repeated it all to their Master.”</p>
<p>The Saviour did not then accept the invitation given to Him, but He thought fit to
honour Abgar with an answer in these words:—</p>

<p>Answer to Abgar’s letter, which the apostle Thomas wrote to this prince by command of the
Saviour.</p>
<p>“Blessed is he who believes in me without having seen me! For it is written of me:
‘Those who see me will not believe in me, and those who do not see me will believe and
live.’ As to what thou hast written asking me to come to thee, I must accomplish here all
that for which I have been sent; and, when I shall have accomplished it all, I shall ascend to
Him who sent me; and when I shall go away I will send one of my disciples, who will cure
thy diseases, and give life to thee and to all those who are with thee.” Anan, Abgar’s courier,
brought him this letter, as well as the portrait of the Saviour, a picture which is still to be
found at this day in the city of Edessa.</p>

<p>Preaching of the apostle Thaddæus at Edessa; copy of five letters.</p>
<p>After the ascension of our Saviour, the Apostle Thomas, one of the twelve, sent one of
the seventy-six disciples, Thaddæus, to the city of Edessa to heal Abgar and to preach the
Gospel, according to the word of the Lord. Thaddæus came to the house of Tobias, a Jewish
prince, who is said to have been of the race of the Pacradouni. Tobias, having left Archam,
did not abjure Judaism with the rest of his relatives, but followed its laws up to the moment
when he believed in Christ. Soon the name of Thaddæus spreads through the whole town.
Abgar, on learning of his arrival, said: “This is indeed he concerning whom Jesus wrote to
me;” and immediately Abgar sent for the apostle. When Thaddæus entered, a marvellous
appearance presented itself to the eyes of Abgar in the countenance of the apostle; the king
having risen from his throne, fell on his face to the earth, and prostrated himself before
Thaddæus. This spectacle greatly surprised all the princes who were present, for they were
ignorant of the fact of the vision. “Art thou really,” said Abgar to Thaddæus, “art thou the
disciple of the ever-blessed Jesus? Art thou he whom He promised to send to me, and canst
thou heal my maladies?” “Yes,” answered Thaddæus; “if thou believest in Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, the desires of thy heart shall be granted.” “I have believed in Jesus,” said Abgar,
“I have believed in His Father; therefore I wished to go at the head of my troops to destroy
the Jews who have crucified Jesus, had I not been prevented by reason of the power of the
Romans.”</p>
<p>Thenceforth Thaddæus began to preach the Gospel to the king and his town; laying his
hands upon Abgar, he cured him; he cured also a man with gout, Abdu, a prince of the town,
much honoured in all the king’s house. He also healed all the sick and infirm people in the
town, and all believed in Jesus Christ. Abgar was baptized, and all the town with him, and
the temples of the false gods were closed, and all the statues of idols that were placed on the
altars and columns were hidden by being covered with reeds. Abgar did not compel any
one to embrace the faith yet from day to day the number of the believers was multiplied.</p>
<p>The Apostle Thaddæus baptizes a manufacturer of silk head-dresses, called Attæus,
consecrates him, appoints him to minister at Edessa, and leaves him with the king instead
of himself. Thaddæus, after having received letters patent from Abgar, who wished that all
should listen to the Gospel of Christ, went to find Sanadroug, son of Abgar’s sister, whom
this prince had appointed over the country and over the army. Abgar was pleased to write
to the Emperor Tiberius a letter in these words:—
Abgar’s letter to Tiberius.</p>
<note type="footnote">3299 Chapter xxxiii.</note>

    
<pb n="1929"/>
<p>“Abgar, king of Armenia, to my Lord Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, greeting:—</p>
<p>“I know that nothing is unknown to your Majesty, but, as your friend, I would make
you better acquainted with the facts by writing. The Jews who dwell in the cantons of
Palestine have crucified Jesus: Jesus without sin, Jesus after so many acts of kindness, so
many wonders and miracles wrought for their good, even to the raising of the dead. Be assured
that these are not the effects of the power of a simple mortal, but of God. During the
time that they were crucifying Him, the sun was darkened, the earth was moved, shaken;
Jesus Himself, three days afterwards, rose from the dead and appeared to many. Now,
everywhere, His name alone, invoked by His disciples, produces the greatest miracles: what
has happened to myself is the most evident proof of it. Your august Majesty knows henceforth
what ought to be done in future with respect to the Jewish nation, which has committed
this crime; your Majesty knows whether a command should not be published through the
whole universe to worship Christ as the true God. Safety and health.”</p>
<p>Answer from Tiberius to Abgar’s letter.</p>
<p>“Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, to Abgar, king of the Armenians, greeting:—</p>
<p>“Your kind letter has been read to me, and I wish that thanks should be given to you
from me. Though we had already heard several persons relate these facts, Pilate has officially
informed us of the miracles of Jesus. He has certified to us that after His resurrection from
the dead He was acknowledged by many to be God. Therefore I myself also wished to do
what you propose; but, as it is the custom of the Romans not to admit a god merely by the
command of the sovereign, but only when the admission has been discussed and examined
in full senate, I proposed the affair to the senate, and they rejected it with contempt,
doubtless because it had not been considered by them first. But we have commanded all
those whom Jesus suits, to receive him amongst the gods. We have threatened with death
any one who shall speak evil of the Christians. As to the Jewish nation which has dared to
crucify Jesus, who, as I hear, far from deserving the cross and death, was worthy of honour,
worthy of the adoration of men—when I am free from the war with rebellious Spain, I will
examine into the matter, and will treat the Jews as they deserve.”</p>
<p>Abgar writes another letter to Tiberius.</p>
<p>“Abgar, king of the Armenians, to my lord Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, greeting:—</p>
<p>“I have received the letter written from your august Majesty, and I have applauded the
commands which have emanated from your wisdom. If you will not be angry with me, I
will say that the conduct of the senate is extremely ridiculous and absurd: for, according to
the senators, it is after the examination and by the suffrages of men that divinity may be
ascribed. Thus, then, if God does not suit man, He cannot be God, since God is to be judged
and justified by man. It will no doubt seem just to my lord and master to send another

<pb n="1930"/>
governor to Jerusalem in the place of Pilate, who ought to be ignominiously driven from
the powerful post in which you placed him; for he has done the will of the Jews: he has
crucified Christ unjustly, without your order. That you may enjoy health is my desire.”
Abgar, having written this letter, placed a copy of it, with copies of the other letters, in
his archives. He wrote also to the young Nerseh, king of Assyria, at Babylon:—</p>
<p>Abgar’s letter to Nerseh.</p>
<p>“Abgar, king of the Armenians, to my son Nerseh, greeting:—</p>
<p>“I have received your letter and acknowledgments. I have released Beroze from his
chains, and have pardoned his offences: if this pleases you, give him the government of
Nineveh. But as to what you write to me about sending you the physician who works miracles
and preaches another God superior to fire and water, that you may see and hear him, I say
to you: he was not a physician according to the art of men; he was a disciple of the Son of
God, Creator of fire and water: he has been appointed and sent to the countries of Armenia.
But one of his principal companions, named Simon, is sent into the countries of Persia.
Seek for him, and you will hear him, you as well as your father Ardachès. He will heal all
your diseases and will show you the way of life.”
Abgar wrote also to Ardachès, king of the Persians, the following letter:—</p>
<p>Abgar’s letter to Ardachès.</p>
<p>“Abgar, king of the Armenians, to Ardachès my brother, king of the Persians, greeting:—</p>
<p>“I know that you have heard of Jesus Christ the Son of God, whom the Jews have crucified,
Jesus who was raised from the dead, and has sent His disciples through all the world
to instruct men. One of His chief disciples, named Simon, is in your Majesty’s territories.
Seek for him, and you will find him, and he will cure you of all your maladies, and will show
you the way of life, and you will believe in his words, you, and your brothers, and all those
who willingly obey you. It is very pleasant to me to think that my relations in the flesh will
be also my relations, my friends, in the spirit.”</p>

years.</p>

<p>Martyrdom of our apostles.</p>
<p>After the death of Abgar, the kingdom of Armenia was divided between two: Ananoun,
Abgar’s son, reigned at Edessa, and his sister’s son, Sanadroug, in Armenia. What took
place in their time has been previously told by others: the apostle’s arrival in Armenia, the
conversion of Sanadroug and his apostasy for fear of the Armenian satraps, and the martyrdom
of the apostle and his companions in the canton of Chavarchan, now called Ardaz,
and the stone opening to receive the body of the apostle, and the removal of this body by
his disciples, his burial in the plain, and the martyrdom of the king’s daughter, Santoukhd,
near the road, and the apparition of the remains of the two saints, and their removal to the
rocks—all circumstances related by others, as we have said, a long time before us: we have
not thought it important to repeat them here. In the same way also what is related of the
martyrdom at Edessa of Attæus, a disciple of the apostle, a martyrdom ordered by Abgar’s
son, has been told by others before us.</p>
<p>The prince who reigned after the death of his father, did not inherit his father’s virtues:
he opened the temples of the idols, and embraced the religion of the heathen. He sent word
to Attæus: “Make me a head-dress of cloth interwoven with gold, like those you formerly
used to make for my father.” He received this answer from Attæus: “My hands shall not
make a head-dress for an unworthy prince, who does not worship Christ the living God.”</p>
<p>Immediately the king ordered one of his armed men to cut off Attæus’ feet. The soldier
went, and, seeing the holy man seated in the chair of the teacher, cut off his legs with his
sword, and immediately the saint gave up the ghost. We mention this cursorily, as a fact
related by others a long while ago. There came then into Armenia the Apostle Bartholomew,
who suffered martyrdom among us in the town of Arepan. As to Simon, who was sent unto
Persia, I cannot relate with certainty what he did, nor where he suffered martyrdom. It is
said that one Simon, an apostle, was martyred at Veriospore. Is this true, or why did the
saint come to this place? I do not know; I have only mentioned this circumstance that you
may know I spare no pains to tell you all that is necessary.</p>

<p>Reign of Sanadroug; murder of Abgar’s children; the princess Helena.
Sanadroug, being on the throne, raises troops with the help of the brave Pacradouni
and Ardzrouni, who had exalted him, and goes to wage war upon the children of Abgar, to
make him self master of the whole kingdom. Whilst Sanadroug was occupied with these
affairs, as if by an effect of divine providence vengeance was taken for the death of Attæus;
for a marble column which the son of Abgar was having erected at Edessa, on the summit
of his palace, while he was underneath to direct the work, escaped from the hands of the
workmen, fell upon him and crushed his feet.</p>
<p>Immediately there came a message from the inhabitants of the town, asking Sanadroug
for a treaty by which he should engage not to disturb them in the exercise of the Christian
religion, in consideration of which, they would give up the town and the king’s treasures.
Sanadroug promised, but in the end violated his oath. Sanadroug put all the children of the
house of Abgar to the edge of the sword, with the exception of the daughters, whom he
withdrew from the town to place them in the canton of Hachdiank. As to the first of Abgar’s
wives, named Helena, he sent her to his town at Kharan, and left to her the sovereignty of
the whole of Mesopotamia, in remembrance of the benefits he had received from Abgar by
Helena’s means.</p>
<p>Helena, pious like her husband Abgar, did not wish to live in the midst of idolaters; she
went away to Jerusalem in the time of Claudius, during the famine which Agabus had predicted;
with all her treasures she bought in Egypt an immense quantity of corn, which she
distributed amongst the poor, a fact to which Josephus testifies. Helena’s tomb, a truly remarkable
one, is still to be seen before the gate of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Restoration of the town of Medzpine; name of Sanadroug; his death.</p>
<p>Of all Sanadroug’s doings and actions, we judge none worthy of remembrance except
the building of the town of Medzpine; for, this town having been shaken by an earthquake,
Sanadroug pulled it down, rebuilt it more magnificently, and surrounded it with double
walls and ramparts. Sanadroug caused to be erected in the middle of the town his statue
holding in his hand a single piece of money, which signifies: “All my treasures have been
used in building the town, and no more than this single piece of money is left to me.”</p>
<p>But why was this prince called Sanadroug? We will tell you: Because Abgar’s sister,
Otæa, while travelling in Armenia in the winter, was assailed by a whirlwind of snow in the
Gortouk mountains; the tempest separated them all, so that none of them knew where his
companion had been driven. The prince’s nurse, Sanod, sister of Piourad Pacradouni, wife
of Khosran Ardzrouni, having taken the royal infant, for Sanadroug was still in the cradle,
laid him upon her bosom, and remained with him under the snow three days and three
nights. Legend has taken possession of this circumstance: it relates that an animal, a new
species, wonderful, of great whiteness, sent by the gods, guarded the child. But so far as we
have been informed, this is the fact: a white dog, which was amongst the men sent in search,
found the child and his nurse; the prince was therefore called Sanadroug, a name taken from
his nurse’s name (and from the Armenian name, dourk, a gift), as if to signify the gift of
Sanod.</p>
<p>Sanadroug, having ascended the throne in the twelfth year of Ardachès, king of the
Persians, and having lived thirty years, died as he was hunting, from an arrow which pierced
his bowels, as if in punishment of the torments which he had made his holy daughter suffer.
Gheroupna, son of the scribe Apchatar, collected all these facts, happening in the time of
Abgar and Sanadroug, and placed them in the archives of Edessa.</p>

<p>Homily on Habib the Martyr, Composed by Mar Jacob.3303</p>
<p>Habib the martyr, clad in flame, hath called to me out of the fire,</p>
<p>That for him likewise I should fashion an image of beauty among the glorious.</p>
<p>Comrade of conquerors, lo! he beckoneth to me out of the burning,</p>
<p>That, as for the glory of his Lord, I should sing concerning him.</p>
<p>In the midst of live coals stands the heroic man, and lo! he calleth to me,</p>
<p>That I should fashion his image: but the blazing fire permits me not.</p>
<p>His love is fervid, glowing is his faith;</p>
<p>His fire also burneth, and who is adequate to recount his love?</p>
<p>Nay, by reason of that love which led the martyr into the fire,</p>
<p>No man is able to recount his beauties divine.</p>
<p>For who shall dare enter and see in the blazing fire
To whom he is like, and after what pattern he is to be fashioned among the glorious?</p>
<p>Shall I fashion his image by the side of the youths, the children of the furnace?</p>
<p>With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib? I know not.
Lo! these were not burned there: how, then, is he like?</p>
<p>He, I say, like them, when he was burned and the youths not?</p>
<p>Which, I ask, the more beautiful—Habib the martyr, or Azariah?</p>
<p>Difficult for me is the image: how I am to look upon it, I know not.</p>
<p>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;</p>
<p>But Habib was burned: which, then, the more beautiful to him that looketh upon him?</p>
<p>Who shall dare say that this is repulsive, or that;
Or not so comely this as that, to him that beholdeth him?</p>

amongst these, of numerous metrical homilies, of which two are given here. Assemani enumerates no less than
231. Ephraem Syrus also wrote a similar homily on Habib, Shamuna, and Guria. The metre of the original in
this and the following homily consists of twelve syllables, and six dissyllabic feet; but whether they were read as
iambs ortroches, or as both, appears to depend on the nature of the Syriac accentuation, which is still an unsettled
question. Hoffmann, in his slight notice of the subject (Gram. Syr., § 13), merely says: “Scimus, poësin Syriacam

<p>That the Fourth form is that of Him who went down into the midst of the furnace,</p>
<p>That He might fashion an image for Habib there along with those of the three?</p>
<p>He giveth a place in the fire to him who was burned,</p>
<p>That he may be, instead of Him the Fourth, by the side of the conquerors.</p>
<p>And, if of the three the beauties be glorious, though they were not burned,</p>
<p>How shall not this one, who was burned, be mingled with the glorious?</p>
<p>If a man have the power either to be burned or not to be burned,</p>
<p>Of this man, who was burned, more exalted was the beauty than that of the three.</p>
<p>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control of all things,
He is to be praised, both where He rescues and where He delivers up.</p>
<p>Moreover, too, the will of the three who were not burned,</p>
<p>And of him who was burned, is one and the same, in this case and in that;3304</p>
<p>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to burn them,</p>
<p>Even those three on their part, burned they would have been;</p>
<p>And, if He had signified to it that it should not burn that one man also,</p>
<p>He would not have been burned; nor had it been of himself that he was rescued.</p>
<p>To go into the fire was of their own will, when they went in;
But that they were not burned—because the Lord of the fire willed and commanded it.</p>
<p>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him who was burned,</p>
<p>And that of him who was not burned, because the will also was equal.</p>
<p>Beloved martyr! exalted is thy beauty; exalted is thy rank:
Graceful too thy crown, and mingled thy story with that of the glorious.</p>
<p>Choice gold art thou, and the fire hath tried thee, and resplendent is thy beauty.</p>
<p>And lo! into the King’s crown art thou wrought, along with the victorious.</p>
<p>Good workman! who, in the doctrine of the Son of God,
Pursueth his course like a valiant3305 man, because of the beauty of his faith.</p>
<p>Habib the martyr was a teacher of that which is true;</p>
<p>A preacher also, whose mouth was full of faith.</p>
<p>Watchful was he, and prompt for service; and he encouraged with his teaching</p>
<p>The household of the house of God, through his faith.</p>
<p>Of light was he full, and he wrestled with the darkness</p>

<p>Which overspread the country from the paganism which had darkened it.</p>
<p>With the Gospel of the Son was his mouth filled in the congregations;</p>
<p>And as it were a leader of the way did he become to the villages when he arrived in them.</p>
<p>Zealous he was, because he was concerned for the doctrine</p>
<p>Divine, that he might establish the adherents3306 of the faith.</p>
<p>At the time when the winds of the pagans blew, a lamp was he,</p>
<p>And flamed forth whilst they blew upon him, and went not out.</p>
<p>All on fire was he, and filled with the love of his Lord, and was concerned
For this—that he might speak of Him without hindrance.3307</p>
<p>The thorns of errour sprang up in the land from paganism;
And, as much as in him lay, he rooted them out by his diligence.</p>
<p>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in the faith,
The friends of Christ,3308 who were harassed by persecutors.</p>
<p>Against sword and against fire did he wrestle,
With love hot as the flame, and was not afraid.</p>
<p>Like a two-edged brand,3309 keen was
His faith, and against error did he contend.</p>
<p>Leaven did he prove to be in this land which had become exhausted3310
Through fondness for the idols of vanity which error had brought in.</p>
<p>He was like salt by reason of his savoury doctrine
To this region, which had become insipid through unbelief.</p>

<p>By the preaching and teaching of that which is true.</p>
<p>He was to the flock a good shepherd whilst he was its overseer;
And his life laid he down for the flock while he tended it.</p>
<p>He chased away the wolf, and drove off from it the beast of prey.</p>
<p>And he repaired the breaches, and gathered the lambs into their folds.</p>
<p>He went out secretly and encouraged the congregations:
He strengthened them, and exhorted them, and held them up.</p>
<p>And he forged armour of faith, and put it on them,
That they might not be ignominiously overthrown3311 by the paganism which abounded.</p>
<p>The flocks of the fold of the Son of God were being laid waste
By persecutors: and he encouraged the lambs and the ewes.</p>
<p>And he was an advocate to the household of faith;
And he taught them not to be daunted by persecutors.</p>
<p>He taught them to run to meet death,
Without being afraid either of sword or of fire.</p>
<p>In the teaching of the Son of God he prospered,
So that his faith pursued its course without dread.</p>
<p>Then errour grew envious, became furious, and was maddened, because of him;
And she pursued after him, that she might shed upon the earth innocent blood.</p>
<p>The Defamer, who hates the race of men,
Laid snares for him, that he might rid the place of his presence.3312</p>
<p>He who hateth the truth pursued after him to put him to death,
That he might make his voice to cease3313 from the teaching of the house of God.</p>
<p>And errour raised an outcry demanding that Habib should die, because she hated him;
Vexation goaded her on, and she sought to take away his life.</p>
<p>His story was talked about3314 before the pagan judge of the country,
And the dear fame of him reached the king: who in great rage,
And because the diadem was interwoven with paganism, decreed3315 death
Against Habib, because he was full of faith.</p>
<p>And, when the command reached the judge, he armed himself
With rage and fury; and, with a mind thirsting for blood,

And like hunters who lay nets for the young stag,
After Habib did they go out to catch him.</p>
<p>But this man was a preacher of the faith,
Who in the highway of the crucifixion was prospering;
And, that he might benefit by his teaching the children of his people,
His work embraced the countries round about him.</p>
<p>So, when error went out after him, she found him not:
Not that he was fled, but that he had gone out to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p>Then, because of the fury of the pagans, which was great beyond all that was meet,
His kindred and his mother did they seize for his sake.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O woman! mother since thou art of the martyr.</p>
<p>For wherefore was it that they seized thee and bound thee, iniquitously?
What do they require of thee, O thou full of beauty? What, I ask, have they required of thee?
Lo! they require of thee that thou bring the martyr, that he may be a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Bring, oh bring thy sweet fruit to the place of the oblation—
The fruit whose smell is fragrant, that it may be incense to the Godhead.</p>
<p>Fair shoot, thy cluster bring from where it is,
That its wine may be for a libation whose taste is sweet.</p>
<p>The lamb heard that they were seeking him, that he might be a sacrifice;
And he set out and came to the sacrificers rejoicing.</p>
<p>He heard that others also were being afflicted for his sake,
And he came that he might bear the suffering which was his, in the stead of many.</p>
<p>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone a sacrifice;
And the fire that was to offer him up was looking out for him until he came.</p>
<p>Of the many who were bound for his sake
Not one single person was seized to die, but only he.</p>
<p>He it was that was worthy, and for him was martyrdom reserved;
And to snatch the martyr’s place no man was able.</p>
<p>And therefore of his own will did he present himself
To the judge, that he might be seized, and die for Jesus’ sake.</p>
<p>He heard that they sought him, and he came that he might be seized, even as they sought
him:
And he went in of himself before the judge, and dauntless was his look.</p>
<p>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to flee from the judge:
For with light was he imbued, and from the darkness he would not flee.</p>
<p>No robber was he, no murderer, no thief,
No child of night: but all his course was run in open day.</p>
<p>Wherefore from his flock should the good shepherd flee,</p>

<pb n="1939"/>
<p>And leave his fold to be devoured by robbers?</p>
<p>Wherefore should the physician flee, who goeth forth to heal diseases,
And to cure souls by the blood of the Son of God?</p>
<p>A fearless countenance3316 did the brave man carry with him, and a great heart;
And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for Jesus’ sake.</p>
<p>He went in, he stood before the judge, saying to him:
I am Habib, whom ye sought: lo! here I stand.</p>
<p>And the pagan trembled, and amazement seized him, and he marvelled at him—
At the man who was not afraid, either of sword or of fire.</p>
<p>While he thought that he was fleeing apace, he entered in and mocked him;
And the judge shook, for he saw him courageous in the very face of death.</p>
<p>A disciple he of that Son of God who said:
“Rise, come, let us go: for he that betrayeth me lo! is here.”</p>
<p>And to the crucifiers, again, He said: “Whom seek ye?”
They say: “Jesus.” And He said to them: “I am He.”</p>
<p>The Son of God of His own will came to the cross;
And on Him the martyr looked, and presented himself uncompelled before the judge.</p>
<p>And the pagan beheld him, and was smitten with fear, and was exasperated against him.</p>
<p>His rage was excited, and he began in his fury to put to him questions.3317</p>
<p>And, as if he had been one who had shed on the ground the blood of the slain,
He proceeded to question the saintly man, but he was not ashamed:
Menacing him, and trying to terrify him, and to frighten him,
And recounting the sufferings which were being prepared by him on his account.</p>
<p>But Habib, when questioned, was not afraid,
Was not ashamed, and was not frightened by the menaces he heard.</p>
<p>Lifting up his voice, he confessed Jesus, the Son of God—
That he was His servant, and was His priest, and His minister.3318</p>
<p>At the fury of the pagans, roaring at him like lions,
He trembled not, nor ceased3319 from the confession of the Son of God.</p>
<p>He was scourged, and the scourgings were very dear to him,
Seeing that he bore a little of the stripes of the Son of God.</p>
<p>He was put into bonds,3320 and he looked on his Lord, whom also they had bound;

And his heart rejoiced that in the path of His sufferings he had begun to walk.</p>
<p>He ascended the block,3321 and they tore him with combs, but his soul was radiant with
light,
Because he was deemed worthy that on him should come the agony of the sufferings of
crucifixion.</p>
<p>In the pathway of death had he set his face to walk,
And what could he desire to find in it but sufferings?</p>
<p>The fire of sacrifice3322 was betrothed to him, and for her did he look;
And she on her part sent him combs, and stripes, and pains, to taste.</p>
<p>All the while that she was coming, she sent him sufferings, that by means of them
He might be prepared, so that when she met him she might not dismay him.</p>
<p>Sufferings purged him, so that, when the blazing fire should put him to the proof,
There might not be any dross found in his choice gold.</p>
<p>And he endured the whole of the pains that came upon him,
That he might have experience of suffering, and in the burning stand like a brave man.</p>
<p>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings which he had to bear:
For he knew that at their termination he should find death.</p>
<p>And he was not afraid, either of death or of sufferings:
For with that wine of the crucifixion his heart was drunk.</p>
<p>He despised his body, while it was being dragged along by the persecutors;
And his limbs, while they were being torn asunder in bitter agony.3323</p>
<p>Scourges on his back, combs on his sides, stocks on his feet,
And fire in front of him: still was he brave and full of faith.</p>
<p>They taunted him: Lo! thou worshippest a man;
But he said: A man I worship not,
But God, who took a body and became man:
Him do I worship, because He is God with Him that begat Him.
The faith of Habib, the martyr, was full of light
And by it was enlightened Edessa, the faithful city.</p>
<p>The daughter of Abgar, whom Addæus betrothed to the crucifixion—
Through it is her light, through it her truth and her faith.</p>
<p>Her king is from it, her martyrs from it, her truth from it;
The teachers also of her faith are from it.</p>

<p>And he received a blessing because of the beauty of his faith.
Sharbil the martyr, son of the Edessæans, more-ever said:
My heart is led captive by God, who became man.</p>
<p>And Habib the martyr, who also was crowned at Edessa,
Confessed these things: that He took a body and became man;
That He is the Son of God, and also is God, and became man.</p>
<p>Edessa learned from teachers the things that are true:
Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her, the faith;
But to others, who were fraudulent teachers, she would not hearken.</p>
<p>Habib the martyr, in the ear of Edessa, thus cried aloud
Out of the midst of the fire: A man I worship not,
But God, who took a body and became man
Him do I worship. Thus confessed the martyr with uplifted voice.</p>
<p>From confessors torn with combs, burnt, raised up on the block, slain
And from a righteous king, did Edessa learn the faith,
And she knows our Lord—that He is even God, the Son of God;
She also learned and firmly believed that He took a body and became man.</p>
<p>Not from common scribes did she learn the faith:
Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her; and she firmly believed them:
And, if she be calumniated as having ever worshipped a man,
She points to her martyrs, who died for Him as being God.</p>
<p>A man I worship not, said Habib,
Because it is written: “Cursed is he that putteth his trust in a man.”3324</p>
<p>Forasmuch as He is God, I worship Him, yea submit to be burned
For His sake, nor will I renounce His faith.</p>
<p>This truth has Edessa held fast from her youth,
And in her old age she will not barter it away as a daughter of the poor.</p>
<p>Her righteous king became to her a scribe, and from him she learned
Concerning our Lord—that He is the Son of God, yea God.</p>
<p>Addæus, who brought the bridegroom’s ring and put it on her hand,
Betrothed her thus to the Son of God, who is the Only-begotten.</p>
<p>Sharbil the priest, who made trial and proof of all gods,
Died, even as he said, “for God who became man.”</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the Only-begotten,
Stretched out their necks to receive the stroke, and for Him died, forasmuch as He is
God.</p>

<p>And Habib the martyr, who was teacher of congregations,
Preached of Him, that He took a body and became man.</p>
<p>For a man the martyr would not have submitted to be burned in the fire;
But he was burned “for the sake of God who became man.”</p>
<p>And Edessa is witness that thus he confessed while he was being burned:
And from the confession of a martyr that has been burned who is he that can escape?</p>
<p>All minds does faith reduce to silence and despise—
She that is full of light and stoopeth not to shadows.</p>
<p>She despiseth him that maligns the Son by denying that He is God;
Him too that saith “He took not a body and became man.”</p>
<p>In faith which was full of truth he stood upon the fire;
And he became incense, and propitiated with his fragrance the Son of God.</p>
<p>In all his afflictions, and in all his tortures, and in all his sufferings,
Thus did he confess, and thus did he teach the blessed city.</p>
<p>And this truth did Edessa hold fast touching our Lord—
Even that He is God, and of Mary became a man.</p>
<p>And the bride hates him that denies His God-head,
And despises and contemns him that maligns His corporeal nature.</p>
<p>And she recognises Him as One in Godhead and in manhood—
The Only-begotten, whose body is inseparable from Him.</p>
<p>And thus did the daughter of the Parthians learn to believe,
And thus did she firmly hold, and thus does she teach him that listens to her.</p>
<p>The judge, therefore, full of zeal for paganism, commanded
That the martyr should be led forth and burned in the fire which was reserved for him.</p>
<p>And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth, as though he had been a murderer,
His confession being kept within his heart towards God.</p>
<p>And they hurried him away, and he went out from the judgment-hall, rejoicing
That the hour was come when the crown should be given to his faith.</p>
<p>And there went out with him crowds of people, that they might bear him company,
Looking upon him, not as a dead man accompanied to his burial,
But as a man who was going away that by means of fire he might become a bridegroom,
And that there might be bestowed the crown which was by righteousness reserved for
him.</p>
<p>They looked upon him as upon a man entering into battle,
And around him were spears, and lances, and swords, but he vanquished them.</p>
<p>They beheld him going up like a champion from the contest,
And in his triumph chaplets were brought to him by those who beheld.</p>
<p>They looked upon him as he vanquished principalities and powers,</p>

<pb n="1943"/>
<p>Which all made war with him, and he put them to shame.</p>
<p>The whole congregation of the followers of Christ exulted over him,
Because he raised up the friends3325 of the faith by the sufferings which he bore.</p>
<p>There went forth with him the Church, a bride full of light;
And her face was beaming on the beloved martyr who was united to her.</p>
<p>Then did his mother, because it was the marriage-feast for her son,
Deck herself in garments nobler than her wont.</p>
<p>Since sordid raiment suited not the banquet-hall,
In magnificent attire all white she clad herself right tastefully.</p>
<p>Hither to the battle came down love to fight
In the mother’s soul—the love of nature, and the love of God.</p>
<p>She looked upon her son as he went forth to be put into the flame;</p>
<p>And, forasmuch as there was in her the love of the Lord, she suffered not.</p>
<p>The yearnings of her mother’s womb cried out on behalf of its fruit;
But faith silenced them, so that their tumult ceased.</p>
<p>Nature shrieked over the limb which was severed from her;
But the love of the Lord intoxicated the soul, that she should not perceive it.</p>
<p>Nature loved, but the love of the Lord did conquer in the strife
Within the soul of the mother, that she should not grieve for her beloved.</p>
<p>And instead of suffering, her heart was filled with all emotions of joy;
And, instead of mourning, she went forth in splendid apparel.</p>
<p>And she accompanied him as he went out to be burned, and was elate,
Because the love of the Lord vanquished that of nature.</p>
<p>And clad in white, as for a bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast—
She the mother of the martyr, and was blithe because of him.</p>
<p>“Shamuna the Second” may we call this blessed one:
Since, had seven been burned instead of one, she had been well content.</p>
<p>One she had, and she gave him to be food for the fire;
And, even as that one, if she had had seven, she had given them all.</p>
<p>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze kindled around him;
And his mother looked on, and grieved not at his burning.</p>
<p>Another eye, which gazeth upon the things unseen,
Was in her soul, and by reason of this she exulted when he was being burned.</p>
<p>On the gems of light which are in martyrs’ crowns she looked,
And on the glory which is laid up for them after their sufferings;
And on the promised blessings which they inherit yonder through their afflictions,</p>
<note type="footnote">3325 Lit. “side,” or “party.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1944"/>
<p>And on the Son of God who clothes their limbs with light;
And on the manifold beauties of that kingdom which shall not be dissolved,</p>
<p>And on the ample door which is opened for them to enter in to God.
On these did the martyr’s mother look when he was being burned,</p>
<p>And she rejoiced, she exalted, and in white did she go forth with him.
She looked upon him while the fire consumed his frame,</p>
<p>And, forasmuch as his crown was very noble, she grieved not.</p>
<p>The sweet root was thrown into the fire, upon the coals;
And it turned to incense, and cleansed the air from pollution.</p>
<p>With the fumes of sacrifice had the air been polluted,
And by the burning of this martyr was it cleansed.</p>
<p>The firmament was fetid with the exhalations from3326 the altars;
And there rose up the sweet perfume of the martyr, and it grew sweet thereby.</p>
<p>And the sacrifices ceased, and there was peace in the assemblies;
And the sword was blunted, that it should no more lay waste the friends of Christ.</p>
<p>With Sharbil it began, with Habib it ended, in our land;
And from that time3327 even until now not one has it slain, since he was burned.</p>
<p>Constantine, chief of conquerors, took the empire,
And the cross has trampled on the diadem of the emperor, and is set upon his head.</p>
<p>Broken is the lofty horn of idolatry,
And from the burning of the martyr even until now not one has it pierced.</p>
<p>His smoke arose, and it became incense to the Godhead;
And by it was the air purged which was tainted by paganism,
And by his burning was the whole land cleansed:
Blessed be he that gave him a crown, and glory, and a good name!

<p>A Homily on Guria and Shamuna, Composed by Mar Jacob.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,
Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</p>
<p>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,
That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p>
<p>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,
Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:—
Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,
And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:
Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,
And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:
Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,
By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:
Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing
Of every kind of error, the lights were not put out;
Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured
In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:
Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence
Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:
Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,
And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:
Two precious pearls, which were
An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aramæan’s son.</p>
<p>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,
And whose faith was known by their sufferings.
On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God
With the marks of combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p>
<p>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,
But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p>
<p>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies:
Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up himself.</p>
<p>Fire and sword proved their love, how true it was;
And more beautiful than silver tried in a furnace of earth were their necks.</p>
<p>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,
Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</p>
<p>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;
And they were enlightened by it, and with His light chased they away the darkness.</p>

<pb n="1946"/>
<p>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,
Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</p>
<p>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;
Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</p>
<p>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably:3328
And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword,3329 all athirst as it was for
blood.</p>
<p>With guilelessness and yet with wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,
As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</p>
<p>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;
Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by them.</p>
<p>Nor guileless only: for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents too
They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</p>
<p>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,
But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:
And, so long as his head is kept from harm, his life abideth in him;
But, if the head be struck, his life is left a prey to destruction.</p>
<p>The head of the soul is men’s faith;
And, if this be preserved unharmed, by it is also preserved their life:3330
Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,
Yet, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;
But, if faith is struck down by unbelief,
Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men3331
Were heedful, that it should not be struck down by persecutors:
For they knew that, if faith is preserved,
Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</p>
<p>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,
That that should not be struck down in which their very life was hidden.</p>
<p>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation,3332
Yea to every kind of torture, that their faith should not be stricken down;
And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,
3328 Or “who changes not.”—Tr.</p>

<p>So hid they their faith within their hearts;
And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:
But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</p>
<p>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,
And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</p>
<p>And from it spring up both life and death to men:
Denying a man dies, confessing he lives, and the mouth hath power over it.</p>
<p>Denial is death, and in confession is the soul’s life;
And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p>
<p>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;
This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</p>
<p>Even the robber by one word of faith
Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise,3333 all fraught with blessings.</p>
<p>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,
Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;
But, like true men holding fast the faith,
They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p>
<p>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to tell of thee?
All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.</p>
<p>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,</p>
<p>And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy championship.</p>
 <p>Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</p>
<p>Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be stolen from us.</p>
<p>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,
Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?
Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,
And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</p>
<p>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,
And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</p>
<p>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so abounding;
And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are so severe upon thee.</p>
<p>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:
For lo! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.</p>
<p>Small thy village, poor thy country: who, then, gave thee</p>
<p>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</p>
<p> Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p>

<p>Take dust from thy threshold, as though it were the medicine of life.</p>
<p>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;
And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors
Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you supplies for their wants.</p>
<p>The Son of God in poverty and want
Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,
His disciples, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,
All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</p>
<p>One fisherman, whose “village” too was a home of fishermen,3334
He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house.3335</p>
<p>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,
He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,
And lo! in a great city became they lords;
And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,
And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p>
<p>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God
These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</p>
<p>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;
And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p>
<p>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,
And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant men.</p>
<p>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted,3336
That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</p>
<p>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;
But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p>
<p>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,
But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</p>
<p>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,
But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p>
<p>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;
But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</p>
<p>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</p>

<p>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</p>
<p>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,
Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p>
<p>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation,3337
How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</p>
<p>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;
Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p>
<p>The judge menaced them, and multiplied his words of threatening;
And recounted tortures and all kinds of inflictions, that he might terrify them.</p>
<p>He spake great words,3338 that by fright and intimidation,
By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,
And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;
And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,
And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;
For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,
And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</p>
<p>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,
Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:
For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;
And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,
The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his threats.</p>
<p>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;
And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</p>
<p>By those things which he told them he tried to frighten them to sacrifice;
And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p>
<p>Truth is wiser than wise words,
And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is falsehood.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking truth,
While the judge continued to utter falsehood.</p>
<p>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,
Because all his menaces against the truth were accounted by them as empty sound.3339</p>

And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it again.</p>
<p>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart
To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</p>
<p>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,
Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of evil.</p>
<p>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with God,
And to “that” country did they set their face to depart;
And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge
To let them pass over to God, for whom they were longing.</p>
<p>This world they accounted as a little tent,
But that yonder as a city full of beauties;
And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence
To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are worthy of it.</p>
<p>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,
And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</p>
<p>A demon’s fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,
And embittered him against the stedfast ones, inciting him to crush them;
And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict them:
And they were a marvel to both sides, when they saw how much they endured.</p>
<p>At the old men’s frame heaven and earth marvelled,
To see how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under their affliction.</p>
<p>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,
Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or that murmurs.</p>
<p>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,
To see how calmly the outstretched forms bore the inflictions laid upon them.3340</p>
<p>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless frames,
To see what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</p>
<p>Yea, and gladdened too were the angels by that fortitude of theirs,
To see how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</p>
<p>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,
There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</p>
<p>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:
But the noble men before him felt no weariness in their afflictions.</p>
<p>He asked them whether they would consent to sacrifice;
But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</p>
<p>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,
<note type="footnote">3340 Lit. “how much the outstretched forms bore in consequence of the inflictions.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1951"/>
Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken.
Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</p>
<p>But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with fortitude from itself.</p>
<p>Alas for the persecutors! how destitute were they of righteousness!</p>
<p>But the children of light—how were they clad in faith!</p>
<p>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,
Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</p>
<p>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable
To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</p>
<p>And what should the martyr do, who had no power to say,
When he was questioned, that he would not sacrifice?</p>
<p>All silent were the old men full of faith,</p>
<p>And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</p>
<p>Yet questioned they were: and in what way, if a man is silent
When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</p>
<p>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,
Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.</p>
<p>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed
The resolve of the new man that was within.</p>
<p>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains
That they were not going to sacrifice, and every one understood their meaning.</p>
<p>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;
But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.</p>
<p>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:
So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were alike stedfast.</p>
<p>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,
And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</p>
<p>Who but must marvel to see that, when the will is watchful and ready,
It is very broad and full of light to him that goeth therein?</p>
<p>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;
And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.</p>
<p>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,
And on “Yea” and “Nay” stand3341 sin and righteousness.</p>
<p>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not sacrifice,</p>
<p>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;</p>
<p>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</p>
<note type="footnote">3341 Or “depend.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1952"/>
<p>Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</p>
<p>Upwards they made a sign, to signify that upwards were they prepared to ascend;
And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</p>
<p>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:
They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>Even while they were silent they were advocates for the Son of God:
For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</p>
<p>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,
And as though with open mouth declared they their faith by signs;
And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,
And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;
And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spake not,
Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</p>
<p>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,
And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,
And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,
And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,
Yet null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the judge,
And without speech the mute sign of the martyrs bore off the palm.</p>
<p>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;
And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;
And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,
The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame.</p>
<p>Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to the silent:
For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of faith.</p>
<p>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;
And they put them in bonds, threatening yet to vanquish them.</p>
<p>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs
Held of no account—yea rather as the light which has no end.</p>
<p>To be without bread, and without water, and without light,
Pleased them well, because of the love of the Son of God.</p>
<p>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up
With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:
Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he prayed
In prayer pure and strained clear by pain.</p>
<p>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,
And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.</p>

<pb n="1953"/>
<p>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his faith;
Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his deed.</p>
<p>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth aside,
And nothing hindereth it—not even sword, not even fire.</p>
<p>His form was turned upside down, but his prayer was unrestrained,
And straight was its path on high to the abode of the angels.</p>
<p>The more the affliction of the chosen martyr was increased,
The more from his lips was all confession heard.</p>
<p>The martyrs longed for the whetted sword affectionately,
And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</p>
<p>A new work has the Son of God wrought in the world—
That dreadful death should be yearned for3342 by many.</p>
<p>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,
Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.</p>
<p>That death is bitter, every one knoweth lo! from earliest time:
To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be slain.</p>
<p>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,
And greeted it with smiles: for it was that which was the occasion of their crowns.</p>
<p>As though it had been something hated, they left the body to be beaten:
Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</p>
<p>For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:
Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they desired.</p>
<p>The Son of God slew death by His crucifixion;
And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the martyrs.</p>
<p>With a wounded serpent one playeth without fear;
A slain lion even a coward will drag along:
The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;
The dread lion did the Son of God slay by His sufferings.</p>
<p>Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of Hades;
And now whosoever will draweth near and mocketh at him, because he is slain.</p>
<p>These old men, Shamuna and Guria, mocked at death,
As at that lion which by the Son of God was slain.</p>
<p>The great serpent, which slew Adam among the trees,
Who could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?</p>
<p>The Son of God crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,
And lo! boys and old men mock at the wounded serpent.</p>

<pb n="1954"/>
<p>Pierced is the lion with the spear which pierced the side of the Son of God;
And whosoever will trampleth on him, yea mocketh at him.</p>
<p>The Son of God—He is the cause of all good things,
And Him doth it behove every mouth to celebrate.</p>
<p>He did Himself espouse3343 the bride with the blood which flowed from His wounds,
And of His wedding-friends He demanded as a nuptial gift3344 the blood of their necks.</p>
<p>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,
And whosoever came to be a guest, He let fall His blood upon him.</p>
<p>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies for His sake
To sufferings and tomes and to all the various forms of woe.3345</p>
<p>At Him they looked as He was mocked by wicked men,
And thus did they themselves endure mockery without a groan.</p>

For ye adorned her with your crowns and with your sufferings.</p>

All error, whilst its voice was uplifted high in unbelief.</p>

<head>Introduction
to
Ancient Syriac Documents.</head>
<p>1. The preceding Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents were inserted in vol. 20 of
the Edinburgh series, quite out of place as it seems to me; and the more so, as other Syriac
fragments were to follow.</p>
<p>2. In vol. 22, equally out of place, and mixed up with incongruous material, followed
the very interesting work of Bardesanes, to which I now assign a natural collocation with
the Edessene Memoirs.</p>
<p>3. In vol. 24, with the Liturgies and other mixed material, comes the third Syriac fagot,
another valuable and very interesting contribution severed from its due connections.</p>
<p>The reader of this volume will rejoice to find Mr. Pratten’s scattered but most instructive
translations here brought together, and arranged in less confused sequence and relations
one with another. The several announcements prefixed to each have, in like manner, been
here gathered and set in order.</p>
<p>It may be worth while, just here, to direct attention to the latest views of scholarship
upon Syria, its language and its antiquities. A learned critic, who often supplies one of our
weekly newspapers with articles on the Oriental languages worthy of the best reviews, has
directed attention3351 to a searching critique of Mommsen’s recent addition to his Roman
History, of a chapter which “deals with Bible-lands in New-Testament times.” Professor
Nöldke of Strasburg, a leading Semitic scholar, in the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental
Society, thus takes him to task:—</p>
<p>“Syria enjoyed a higher prosperity under the Romans than Mommsen concedes, and this
continued down into the Christian period. The Hellenization made rapid strides, but not
in such a manner that the Greek language or Greek culture spread to a considerable degree;
but rather, in such a way that European arts and manners of life were established, and that
a number of elements of Occidental culture became powerful in the thinking and language
of the educated. Mommsen, according to my conviction, considers the Hellenization of
Syria to have advanced much farther than it actually had. That the language of the country
had been entirely banished from the circles of the educated, and that it had assumed the
position in reference to the Greek which the Celtic in full had assumed over against the
Latin, is certainly an exaggerated view. The Aramaic was an old developed language (Cul-
<note type="footnote">3351 New-York Independent, June 24, 1886.</note>

<pb n="1957"/>
tursprache), which was already written before a single letter was seen in Latium. In the days
of the Achæmenidian rulers this was the official language of Egypt, and even of Asia Minor,
and was accordingly spread far beyond the original territory. Again we find this language in
the days of the Roman emperors not only in Palmyra, but spread also in the whole country
of the Nabatheans, and down to almost Medina; here again beyond its native limits, as the
official written language. And that this was not merely a remnant of the former political
supremacy is evident from the fact that the documents of Palmyra and those of the
Nabatheans, in an equal manner, show a younger stage of development of language than
that of the Achæmenidian period; this stage being virtually the same as is seen in the various
Jewish literary works of that time.”</p>
<p>As Mommsen is continuing his irreligious elaborations of history, it may be well to bear
in mind his superficial ideas on such subjects, especially when he is reaching the affairs of
early Christianity.</p>
<p>1. Our translator (Mr. Pratten) makes the following announcements:—</p>
<p>“The translation of the Syriac pieces which follow3352 is based on a careful examination
of that made by Dr. Cureton, the merits of which are cordially acknowledged. It will, however,
be seen that it differs from that in many and important particulars.
“Many thanks are due to the Dean of Canterbury for his kindness in giving much
valuable help.”</p>
<p>2. He thus introduces the treatise of Bardesanes:—</p>
<p>“Bardesan, or Bardesanes, according to one account, was born at Edessa in 154 a.d., and
it is supposed that he died sometime between 224 and 230. Eusebius says that he flourished
in the time of Marcus Aurelius. He was for some time resident at the court of Abgar VI.,
King of Edessa, with whom he was on intimate terms. He at first belonged to the Gnostic
sect of the Valentinians; but abandoning it, he seemed to come nearer the orthodox beliefs.
In reality, it is said, he devised errours of his own. He wrote many works. Eusebius attributes
the work now translated, The Book of Laws, or On Fate, to Bardesanes. Many modern critics
have come to the conclusion that it was written by a scholar of Bardesanes, but that it gives
us the genuine opinions and reasonings of Bardesanes. The question is of interest in connection
with the Clementine Recognitions, which contain a large portion of the work. The
Syriac was first published by Cureton in his Spicilegium.”</p>
<p>3. In introducing the Mara bar Serapion and the Ambrose,3353 he thus refers to his
friend Dr. Payne Smith:—</p>
<p>3352 That is, in vol. xxii. of the Edinburgh edition.</p>
<p>3353 Vol. xxiv., ed. Edinburgh. The latter was formerly ascribed to Justin Martyr.</p>

<pb n="1958"/>
<p>The text of the two following short pieces3354 is found in the Spicilegium Syriacum of
the late Dr. Cureton. This careful scholar speaks of the second of these compositions as
containing “some very obscure passages.” The same remark holds good also of the first.

in the text, they might have been removed, had I been able to avail myself of the opportunity

<p>Bardesan.3355</p>
<p>The Book of the Laws of Divers Countries.3356
Some days since we were calling3357 to pay a visit to our brother Shemashgram, and
Bardesan came and found us there. And when he had made inquiries after his health,3358
and ascertained that he was well, he asked us, “What were you talking about? for I heard
your voice outside as I was coming in.” For it was his habit, whenever he found us talking
about anything before he came,3359 to ask us, “What were you saying?” that he might talk
with us about it.</p>
<p>“Avida here,” said we to him, “was saying to us, ‘If God is one, as ye say, and if He is
the creator of men, and if it is His will that you should do that which you are commanded,
why did He not so create men that they should not be able to do wrong, but should constantly
be doing that which is right? for in this way His will would have been accomplished.’”</p>
<p>“Tell me, my son Avida,” said Bardesan to him, “why it has come into thy mind that
the God of all is not One; or that He is One, but doth not will that men should behave
themselves justly and uprightly?”</p>
<p>“I, sir,” said Avida, “have asked these brethren, persons of my own age, in order that
‘they’ may return me an answer.”</p>
<p>“If,” said Bardesan to him, “thou wishest to learn, it were for thy advantage to learn
from some one who is older than they; but if to teach, it is not requisite for ‘thee’ to ask
‘them,’ but rather that thou shouldst induce ‘them’ to ask ‘thee’ what they wish. For teachers
are ‘asked’ questions, and do not themselves ask them; or, if they ever do ask a question, it
is to direct the mind of the questioner, so that he may ask properly, and they may know
what his desire is. For it is a good thing that a man should know how to ask questions.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Avida, “I wish to learn; but I began first of all to question my brethren
here, because I was too bashful to ask thee.”</p>
<p>“Thou speakest becomingly,”3360 said Bardesan. “But know, nevertheless, that he who
asks questions properly, and wishes to be convinced, and approaches the way of truth without
contentiousness, has no need to be bashful; because he is sure by means of the things I have
mentioned to please him to whom his questions are addressed. If so be, therefore, my son,
thou hast any opinion of thy own3361 respecting this matter about which thou hast asked,
tell it to us all; and, if we too approve of it, we shall express our agreement with thee; and,
if we do not approve of it, we shall be under obligation to show thee why we do not approve
of it. But if thou wast simply desirous of becoming acquainted with this subject, and hast
no opinion of thy own about it, as a man who has but lately joined the disciples and is a recent
inquirer, I will tell thee respecting it; so that thou mayest not go from us empty away. If,
moreover, thou art pleased with those things which I shall say to thee, we have other things
besides to tell thee3362 concerning this matter; but, if thou art not pleased, we on our part
shall have stated our views without any personal feeling.”</p>
<p>“I too,” said Avida, “shall be much gratified3363 to hear and to be convinced: because
it is not from another that I have heard of this subject, but I have spoken of it to my brethren
here out of my own mind; and they have not cared to convince me; but they say, ‘Only believe,
and thou wilt then be able to know everything.’ But for my part, I cannot believe unless I
be convinced.”</p>
<p>“Not only,” said Bardesan, “is Avida unwilling to believe, but there are many others also
who, because there is no faith in them, are not even capable of being convinced; but they
are always pulling down and building up, and so are found destitute of all knowledge of the
truth. But notwithstanding, since Avida is not willing to believe, lo! I will speak to you who
do believe, concerning this matter about which he asks; and thus he too will hear something
further about it.”</p>
<p>He began accordingly to address us as follows: “Many men are there who have not faith,
and have not received knowledge from the True Wisdom.3364 In consequence of this, they
are not competent to speak and give instruction to others, nor are they readily inclined
themselves to hear. For they have not the foundation of faith to build upon, nor have they
any confidence on which to rest their hope. Moreover, because they are accustomed to

doubt even concerning God, they likewise have not in them the fear of Him, which would
of itself deliver them from all other fears: for he in whom there is no fear of God is the slave
of all sorts of fears. For even with regard to those things of various kinds which they disbelieve,
they are not certain that they disbelieve them rightly, but they are unsettled in their
opinions, and have no fixed belief,3365 and the taste of their thoughts is insipid in their own
mouth; and they are always haunted with fear, and flushed with excitement, and reckless.</p>
<p>“But with regard to what Avida has said: ‘How is it that God did not so make us that
we should not sin and incur condemnation?’—if man had been made so, he would not have
belonged to himself, but would have been the instrument of him that moved him; and it is
evident also, that he who moves an instrument as he pleases, moves it either for good or for
evil. And how, in that case, would a man differ from a harp, on which another plays; or
from a ship, which another guides: where the praise and the blame reside in the hand of
the performer or the steersman,3366 and the harp itself knows not what is played on it, nor
the ship itself whether it be well steered and guided or ill, they being only instruments made
for the use of him in whom is the requisite skill? But God in His benignity chose not so to
make man; but by freedom He exalted him above many of His creatures, and even made
him equal with the angels. For look at the sun, and the moon, and the signs of the zodiac,3367
and all the other creatures which are greater than we in some points, and see how individual
freedom has been denied them, and how they are all fixed in their course by decree, so that
they may do that only which is decreed for them, and nothing else. For the sun never says,
I will not rise at my appointed time; nor the moon, I will not change, nor wane, nor wax;
nor does any one of the stars say, I will not rise nor set; nor the sea, I will not bear up the
ships, nor stay within my boundaries; nor the mountains, We will not continue in the places
in which we are set; nor do the winds say, We will not blow; nor the earth, I will not bear
up and sustain whatsoever is upon me. But all these things are servants, and are subject to
one decree: for they are the instruments of the wisdom of God, which erreth not.</p>
<p>“Not so, however, with man: for, if everything ministered, who would be he that is
ministered to? And, if everything were ministered to, who would be he that ministered?
In that case, too, there would not be one thing diverse from another: yet that which is one,
and in which there is no diversity of parts, is a being3368 which up to this time has not been

it can hardly go beyond its original meaning of ens, entia, Wesen, that which is. It evidently refers, however,

fashioned. But those things which are destined3369 for ministering have been fixed in the
power of man: because in the image of Elohim3370 was he made. Therefore have these
things, in the benignity of God, been given to him, that they may minister to him for a season.
It has also been given to him to be guided by his own will; so that whatever he is able to do,
if he will he may do it, and if he do not will he may not do it, and that so he may justify
himself or condemn. For, had he been made so as not to be able to do evil and thereby incur
condemnation, in like manner also the good which he did would not have been his own,
and he could not have been justified by it. For, if any one should not of his own will do that
which is good or that which is evil, his justification and his condemnation would rest simply
with that Fortune to which he is subjected.3371</p>
<p>“It will therefore be manifest to you, that the goodness of God is great toward man, and
that freedom has been given to him in greater measure than to any of those elemental bodies3372
of which we have spoken, in order that by this freedom he may justify himself, and
order his conduct in a godlike manner, and be copartner with angels, who are likewise
possessed of personal freedom. For we are sure that, if the angels likewise had not been
possessed of personal freedom, they would not have consorted with the daughters of men,
and sinned, and fallen from their places. In like manner, too, those other angels, who did
the will of their Lord, were, by reason of their self-control, raised to higher rank, and sanctified,
and received noble gifts. For every being in existence is in need of the Lord of all; of
His gifts also there is no end.</p>
<p>Know ye, however, notwithstanding what I have said, that even those things of which
I have spoken as subsisting by decree are not absolutely destitute of all freedom; and on this
account, at the last day, they will all be made subject to judgment.”</p>
<p>“But how,” said I to him, “should those things which are fixed and regulated by decree
be judged?”</p>

<p>“Not inasmuch as they are fixed, O Philip,” said he, “will the elements be judged, but
inasmuch as they are endowed with power. For beings3373 are not deprived of their natural
properties3374 when they come to be fashioned, but only of the full exercise of their
strength,3375 suffering a decrease3376 of power through their intermingling one with another,
and being kept in subjection by the power of their Maker; and in so far as they are in subjection
they will not be judged, but in respect of that only which is under their own control.”</p>
<p>“Those things,” said Avida to him, “which thou hast said, are very good; but, lo! the
commands which have been given to men are severe, and they cannot perform them.”</p>
<p>“This,” said Bardesan, “is the saying of one who has not the will to do that which is right;
nay, more, of him who has already yielded obedience and submission to his foe. For men
have not been commanded to do anything but that which they are able to do. For the
commandments set before us are only two, and they are such as are compatible with freedom
and consistent with equity: one, that we refrain from everything which is wrong, and which
we should not like to have done to ourselves; and the other, that we should do that which
is right, and which we love and are pleased to have done to us likewise. Who, then, is the
man that is too weak to avoid stealing, or to avoid lying, or to avoid acts of profligacy, or to
avoid hatred and deception? For, lo! all these things are under the control of the mind of
man; and are not dependent on3377 the strength of the body, but on the will of the soul.
For even if a man be poor, and sick, and old, and disabled in his limbs, he is able to avoid
doing all these things. And, as he is able to avoid doing these things, so is he able to love,
and to bless, and to speak the truth, and to pray for what is good for every one with whom
he is acquainted; and if he be in health, and capable of working,3378 he is able also to give of
that which he has; moreover, to support with strength of body him that is sick and enfeebled—
this also he can do.</p>
<p>“Who, then, it is that is not capable of doing that which men destitute of faith complain
of, I know not. For my part, I think that it is precisely in respect to these commandments
that man has more power than in anything else. For they are easy, and there are no circumstances
that can hinder their performance. For we are not commanded to carry heavy loads

of stones, or of timber, or of anything else, which those only who have great bodily strength
can do; nor to build fortresses3379 and found cities, which kings only can do; nor to steer a
ship, which mariners only have the skill to steer; nor to measure and divide land, which
land-measurers only know how to do; nor to practise any one of those arts which are possessed
by some, while the rest are destitute of them. But there have been given to us, in accordance
with the benignity of God, commandments having no harshness in them3380—such
as any living man whatsoever3381 may rejoice to do.3382 For there is no man that does not
rejoice when he does that which is right, nor any one that is not gladdened within himself
if he abstains from things that are bad—except those who were not created for this good
thing, and are called tares.3383 For would not the judge be unjust who should censure a
man with regard to any such thing as he has not the ability to do?”</p>
<p>“Sayest thou of these deeds, O Bardesan,” said Avida to him, “that they are easy to do?”</p>
<p>“To him that hath the will,” said Bardesan, “I have said, and do still say, that they are
easy. For this obedience I contend for is the proper behaviour of a free mind,3384 and of the
726
soul which has not revolted against its governors. As for the action of the body, there are
many things which hinder it: especially old age, and sickness, and poverty.”</p>
<p>“Possibly,” said Avida, “a man may be able to abstain from the things that are bad; but
as for doing the things that are good, what man is capable of this?”</p>
<p>“It is easier,” said Bardesan, “to do good than to abstain from evil. For the good comes
from the man himself,3385 and therefore he rejoices whenever he does good; but the evil is
the work of the Enemy, and therefore it is that, only when a man is excited by some evil
passion, and is not in his sound natural condition,3386 he does the things that are bad. For
know, my son, that for a man to praise and bless his friend is an easy thing; but for a man
to refrain from taunting and reviling one whom he hates is not easy: nevertheless, it is
possible. When, too, a man does that which is right, his mind is gladdened, and his conscience
at ease, and he is pleased for every one to see what he does. But, when a man behaves
amiss and commits wrong, he is troubled and excited, and full of anger and rage, and distressed
in his soul and in his body; and, when he is in this state of mind, he does not like to
be seen by any one; and even those things in which he rejoices, and which are accompanied

with praise and blessing from others, are spurned from his thoughts, while those things by
which he is agitated and disturbed are rendered more distressing to him because accompanied
by the curse of conscious guilt.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, however, some one will say that fools also are pleased when they do abominable
things. Undoubtedly: but not because they do them as such, nor because they receive any
conmendation for them, nor because they do them with a good hope;3387 nor does the
pleasure itself stay long with them. For the pleasure which is experienced in a healthy state
of the soul, with a good hope, is one thing; and the pleasure of a diseased state of the soul,
with a bad hope, is another. For lust is one thing, and love is another; and friendship is one
thing, and good-fellowship another; and we ought without any difficulty to understand that
the false counterfeit of affection which is called lust, even though there be in it the enjoyment
of the moment, is nevertheless widely different from true affection, whose enjoyment is for
ever, incorruptible and indestructible.”</p>
<p>“Avida here,” said I to him, “has also been speaking thus: ‘It is from his nature that man
does wrong; for, were he not naturally formed to do wrong, he would not do it.’”</p>
<p>“If all men,” said Bardesan, “acted alike,3388 and followed one bias,3389 it would then
be manifest that it was their nature that guided them, and that they had not that freedom
of which I have been speaking to you. That you may understand, however, what is nature
and what is freedom, I will proceed to inform you.</p>
<p>“The nature of man is, that he should be born, and grow up, and rise to his full stature,
and produce children, and grow old, eating and drinking, and sleeping and waking, and
that then he should die. These things, because they are of nature, belong to all men; and
not to all men only, but also to all animals whatsoever,3390 and some of them also to trees.
For this is the work of physical nature,3391 which makes and produces and regulates
everything just as it has been commanded. Nature, I say, is found to be maintained among
animals also in their actions. For the lion eats flesh, in accordance with his nature; and
therefore all lions are eaters of flesh. The sheep eats grass; and therefore all sheep are eaters
of grass. The bee makes honey, by which it is sustained; therefore all bees are makers of
honey. The ant collects for herself a store in summer, from which to sustain herself in
winter; and therefore do all ants act likewise. The scorpion strikes with its sting him who
has not hurt it; and thus do all scorpions strike. Thus all animals preserve their nature: the
eaters of flesh do not eat herbage; nor do the eaters of herbage eat flesh.</p>

<pb n="1966"/>
<p>“Men, on the contrary, are not governed thus; but, whilst in the matters pertaining to
their bodies they preserve their nature like animals, in the matters pertaining to their minds
they do that which they choose, as those who are free,3392 and endowed with power, and
as made in the likeness of God. For there are some of them that eat flesh, and do not touch
bread; and there are some of them that make a distinction between the several kinds of fleshfood;
and there are some of them that do not eat the flesh of any animal whatever.3393 There
are some of them that become the husbands of their mothers, and of their sisters, and of
their daughters; and there are some who do not consort with women at all. There are those
who take it upon themselves to inflict vengeance, like lions and leopards; and there are those
who strike him that has not done them any wrong, like scorpions; and there are those that
are led like sheep, and do not harm their conductors. There are some that behave themselves
with kindness, and some with justice, and some with wickedness.</p>
<p>“If any one should say that each one of them has a nature so to do, let him be assured3394
that it is not so. For there are those who once were profligates and drunkards; and, when
the admonition of good counsels reached them, they became pure and sober,3395 and spurned
their bodily appetites. And there are those who once behaved with purity and sobriety; and
when they turned away from right admonition, and dared to set themselves against the
commands of Deity and of their teachers, they fell from the way of truth, and became profligates
and revellers. And there are those who after their fall repented again, and fear came
and abode upon them, and they turned themselves afresh towards the truth which they had
before held.3396</p>
<p>“What, therefore, is the nature of man? For, lo! all men differ one from another in their
conduct and in their aims,3397 and such only as are of3398 one mind and of one purpose
resemble one another. But those men who, up to the present moment, have been enticed
by their appetites and governed by their anger, are resolved to ascribe any wrong they do
to their Maker, that they themselves may be found faultless, and that He who made them
may, in the idle talk of men,3399 bear the blame. They do not consider that nature is amenable
to no law. For a man is not found fault with for being tall or short in his stature, or white
or black, or because his eyes are large or small, or for any bodily defect whatsoever; but he

is found fault with if he steal, or lie, or practise deceit, or poison another, or be abusive, or
do any other such-like things.</p>
<p>“From hence, lo! it will be evident, that for those things which are not in our own hands,
but which we have from nature, we are in no wise condemned, nor are we in any wise justified;
but by those things which we do in the exercise of our personal freedom, if they be right
we are justified and entitled to praise, and if they be wrong we are condemned and subjected
to blame.”</p>
<p>Again we questioned him, and said to him: “There are others who say that men are
governed by the decree of Fate, so as to act at one time wickedly, and at another time well.”</p>
<p>“I too am aware, O Philip and Baryama,” said he to us, “that there are such men: those
who are called Chaldæans, and also others who are fond of this subtle knowledge,3400 as I
myself also once was. For it has been said by me in another place,3401 that the soul of man
longs3402 to know that which the many are ignorant of, and those men make it their aim to
do this;3403and that all the wrong which men commit, and all that they do aright, and all
those things which happen to them, as regards riches and poverty, and sickness and health,
and blemishes of the body, come to them through the governance of those stars which are
called the Seven;3404 and that they are, in fact, governed by them. But there are others who
affirm the opposite of these things,—how that this art is a lying invention of the astrologers;
3405 or that Fate has no existence whatever, but is an empty name; that, on the contrary,
all things, great and small, are placed in the hands of man; and that bodily blemishes and
faults simply befall and happen to him by chance. But others, again, say that whatsoever a
man does he does of his own will, in the exercise of the freedom which has been given to
him, and that the faults and blemishes and other untoward things which befall him he receives
as punishment from God.</p>
<p>“For myself, however according to my weak judgment,3406 the matter appears to stand
thus: that these three opinions3407 are partly to be accepted as true, and partly to be rejected
as false;—accepted as true, because men speak after the appearances which they see, and

fallacious, because the wisdom of God is too profound3408 for them—that wisdom which
founded the world, and created man, and ordained Governors, and gave to all things the
degree of pre-eminence which is suited to every one of them. What I mean is, that this power
is possessed by God, and the Angels, and the Potentates,3409 and the Governors,3410 and
the Elements, and men, and animals; but that this power has not been given to all these orders
of beings of which I have spoken in respect to everything (for He that has power over
everything is One); but over some things they have power, and over some things they have
not power, as I have been saying: in order that in those things over which they have power
the goodness of God may be seen, and in those over which they have no power they may
know that they have a Superior.</p>
<p>“There is, then, such a thing as Fate, as the astrologers say. That everything, moreover,
is not under the control of our will, is apparent from this—that the majority of men have
had the will to be rich, and to exercise dominion over their fellows, and to be healthy in
their bodies, and to have things in subjection to them as they please; but that wealth is not
found except with a few, nor dominion except with one here and another there, nor health
of body with all men; and that even those who are rich do not have complete possession of
their riches, nor do those who are in power have things in subjection to them as they wish,
but that sometimes things are disobedient to them as they do not wish; and that at one time
the rich are rich as they desire, and at another time they become poor as they do not desire;
and that those who are thoroughly poor have dwellings such as they do not wish, and pass
their lives in the world as they do not like, and covet many things which only flee from them.
Many have children, and do not rear them; others rear them, and do not retain possession
of them; others retain possession of them, and they become a disgrace and a sorrow to their
parents. Some are rich, as they wish, and are afflicted with ill-health, as they do not wish;
others are blessed with good health, as they wish, and afflicted with poverty, as they do not
wish. There are those who have in abundance the things they wish for, and but few of those
things for which they do not wish; and there are others who have in abundance the things
they do not wish for, and but few of those for which they do wish.3411</p>

<p>“And so the matter is found to stand thus: that wealth, and honours, and health, and
sickness, and children, and all the other various objects of desire, are placed under the control
of Fate, and are not in our own power; but that, on the contrary, while we are pleased and
delighted with such things as are in accordance with our wishes, towards such as we do not
wish for we are drawn by force; and, from those things which happen to us when we are not
pleased, it is evident that those things also with which we are pleased do not happen to us
because we desire them; but that things happen as they do happen, and with some of them
we are pleased, and with others not.</p>
<p>“And thus we men are found to be governed by Nature all alike, and by Fate variously,
and by our freedom each as he chooses.
“But let us now proceed to show with respect to Fate that it has not power over
everything. Clearly not: because that which is called Fate is itself nothing more than a certain
order of procession,3412 which has been given to the Potentates and Elements by God; and,
in conformity with this said procession and order, intelligences3413 undergo change when
they descend3414 to be with the soul, and souls undergo change when they descend3415 to
be with bodies; and this order, under the name of Fate and γένεσις,3416 is the agent of the
changes3417 that take place in this assemblage of parts of which man consists,3418 which is
being sifted and purified for the benefit of whatsoever by the grace of God and by goodness
has been benefited, and is being and will continue to be benefited until the close of all things.</p>
<p>“The body, then, is governed by Nature, the soul also sharing in its experiences and
sensations; and the body is neither hindered nor helped by Fate in the several acts it performs.

mother before the age of thirteen. In like manner, too, there is a law for old age: for women
then become incapable of bearing, and men cease to possess the natural power of begetting
children; while other animals, which are likewise governed by their nature, do, even before
those ages I have mentioned, not only produce offspring, but also become too old to do so,
just as the bodies of men also, when they are grown old, cease to propagate: nor is Fate able
to give them offspring at a time when the body has not the natural power to give them.
Neither, again, is Fate able to preserve the body of man in life without meat and drink; nor
yet, even when it has meat and drink, to grant it exemption from death: for these and many
other things belong exclusively to Nature.3419</p>
<p>“But, when the times and methods of Nature have had their full scope, then does Fate
come and make its appearance among them, and produce effects of various kinds: at one
time helping Nature and augmenting its power, and at another crippling and baffling it.
Thus, from Nature comes the growth and perfecting of the body; but apart from Nature,
that is by Fate, come diseases and blemishes in the body. From Nature comes the union of
male and female, and the unalloyed happiness of them both; but from Fate comes hatred
and the dissolution of the union, and, moreover, all that impurity and lasciviousness which
by reason of the natural propensity to intercourse men practise in their lust. From Nature
comes birth and children; and from Fate, that sometimes the children are deformed, and
sometimes are cast away, and sometimes die before their time. From Nature comes a supply
of nourishment sufficient for the bodies of all creatures;3420and from Fate comes the want
of sustenance, and consequent suffering in those bodies; and so, again, from the same Fate
comes gluttony and unnecessary luxury. Nature ordains that the aged shall be judges for
the young, and the wise for the foolish, and that the strong shall be set over3421 the weak,
and the brave over the timid; but Fate brings it to pass that striplings are set over the aged,
and the foolish over the wise, and that in time of war the weak command the strong, and
the timid the brave.</p>
<p>“You must distinctly understand3422 that, in all cases in which Nature is disturbed from
its direct course, its disturbance comes by reason of Fate; and this happens because the
Chiefs3423 and Governors, with whom rests that agency of change3424 which is called
Nativity, are opposed to one another. Some of them, which are called Dexter, are those
which help Nature, and add to its predominance,3425 whenever the procession is favourable

to them, and they stand in those regions of the zodiac which are in the ascendant, in their
own portions.3426 Those, on the contrary, which are called Sinister are evil, and whenever
they in their turn are in possession of the ascendant they act in opposition to Nature; and
not on men only do they inflict harm, but at times on animals also, and trees, and fruits,
and the produce of the year, and fountains of water, and, in short, on everything that is
comprised within Nature, which is under their government.</p>
<p>“And in consequence of this,—namely, the divisions and parties which exist among the
Potentates,—some men have thought that the world is governed by these contending powers
without any superintendence from above. But that is because they do not understand that
this very thing—I mean the parties and divisions subsisting among them,—and the justification
and condemnation consequent on their behaviour, belong to that constitution of things
founded in freedom which has been given by God, to the end that these agents likewise, by
reason of their self-determining power,3427 may be either justified or condemned. Just as
we see that Fate crushes Nature, so can we also see the freedom of man defeating and
crushing Fate itself,—not, however, in everything,—just as also Fate itself does not in
everything defeat Nature. For it is proper that the three things, Nature, and Fate, and
Freedom, should be continued in existence until the procession of which I before spoke be
completed, and the appointed measure and number of its evolutions be accomplished, even
as it seemed good to Him who ordains of what kind shall be the mode of life and the end
of all creatures, and the condition of all beings and natures.”</p>
<p>“I am convinced,” said Avida, “by the arguments thou hast brought forward, that it is
not from his nature that a man does wrong, and also that all men are not governed alike.
If thou canst further prove also that it is not from Fate and Destiny that those who do wrong
so act, then will it be incumbent on us to believe that man possesses personal freedom, and
by his nature has the power both to follow that which is right and to avoid that which is
wrong, and will therefore also justly be judged at the last day.”</p>
<p>“Art thou,” said Bardesan, “by the fact that all men are not governed alike, convinced
that it is not from their nature that they do wrong? Why, then, thou canst not possibly escape
the conviction3428 that neither also from Fate exclusively do they do wrong, if we are able
to show thee that the sentence of the Fates and Potentates does not influence all men alike,
but that we have freedom in our own selves, so that we can avoid serving physical nature
and being influenced by the control of the Potentates.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou,” said Bardesan, “read the books of the astrologers3429 who are in Babylon,

of men; and the books of the Egyptians, in which are described all the various characters
which men happen to have?”</p>
<p>“I have read books of astrology,”3430 said Avida, “but I do not know which are those of
the Babylonians and which those of the Egyptians.”</p>
<p>“The teaching of both countries,” said Bardesan, “is the same.”</p>
<p>“It is well known to be so,” said Avida.</p>
<p>“Listen, then,” said Bardesan, “and observe, that that which the stars decree by their
Fate and their portions is not practised by all men alike who are in all parts of the earth.
For men have made laws for themselves in various countries, in the exercise of that freedom
which was given them by God: forasmuch as this gift is in its very nature opposed to that
Fate emanating from the Potentates, who assume to themselves that which was not given
them. I will begin my enumeration of these laws, so far as I can remember them, from the
East, the beginning of the whole world:—</p>
<p>“Laws of the Seres.—The Seres have laws forbidding to kill, or to commit impurity, or
to worship idols; and in the whole of Serica there are no idols, and no harlots, nor any one
that kills a man, nor any that is killed: although they, like other men, are born at all hours
and on all days. Thus the fierce Mars, whensoever he is ‘posited’ in the zenith, does not
overpower the freedom of the Seres, and compel a man to shed the blood of his fellow with
an iron weapon; nor does Venus, when posited with Mars, compel any man whatever among
the Seres to consort with his neighbour’s wife, or with any other woman. Rich and poor,
however, and sick people and healthy, and rulers and subjects, are there: because such
matters are given into the power of the Governors.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Brahmans who are in India.—Again, among the Hindoos, the Brahmans,
of whom there are many thousands and tens of thousands, have a law forbidding to kill at
all, or to pay reverence to idols, or to commit impurity, or to eat flesh, or to drink wine; and
among these people not one of these things ever takes place. Thousands of years, too, have
elapsed, during which these men, lo! have been governed by this law which they made for
themselves.</p>
<p>“Another Law which is in India.—There is also another law in India, and in the same
zone,3431 prevailing among those who are not of the caste3432 of the Brahmans, and do not

<pb n="1973"/>
embrace their teaching, bidding them serve idols, and commit impurity, and kill, and do
other bad things, which by the Brahmans are disapproved. In the same zone of India, too,
there are men who are in the habit of eating the flesh of men, just as all other nations eat
the flesh of animals. Thus the evil stars have not compelled the Brahmans to do evil and
impure things; nor have the good stars prevailed on the rest of the Hindoos to abstain from
doing evil things; nor have those stars which are well ‘located’ in the regions which properly
belong to them,3433 and in the signs of the zodiac favourable to a humane disposition,3434
prevailed on those who eat the flesh of men to abstain from using this foul and abominable
food.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Persians.—The Persians, again, have made themselves laws permitting
them to take as wives their sisters, and their daughters, and their daughters’ daughters; and
there are some who go yet further, and take even their mothers. Some of these said Persians
are scattered abroad, away from their country, and are found in Media, and in the country
of the Parthians,3435 and in Egypt, and in Phrygia (they are called Magi); and in all the
countries and zones in which they are found, they are governed by this law which was made
for their fathers. Yet we cannot say that for all the Magi, and for the rest of the Persians,
Venus was posited with the Moon and with Saturn in the house of Saturn in her portions,
while the aspect of Mars was toward them.3436 There are many places, too, in the kingdom
of the Parthians, where men kill their wives, and their brothers, and their children, and incur
no penalty; while among the Romans and the Greeks, he that kills one of these incurs capital
punishment, the severest of penalties.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Geli.—Among the Geli the women sow and reap, and build, and perform
all the tasks of labourers, and wear no raiment of colours, and put on no shoes, and use no
pleasant ointments; nor does any one find fault with them when they consort with strangers,
or cultivate intimacies with their household slaves. But the husbands of these Gelæ are
dressed in garments of colours, and ornamented with gold and jewels, and anoint themselves
with pleasant ointments. Nor is it on account of any effeminacy on their part that they act
in this manner, but on account of the law which has been made for them: in fact, all the
men are fond of hunting and addicted to war. But we cannot say that for all the women of
the Geli Venus was posited in Capricorn or in Aquarius, in a position of ill luck; nor can
3433 That is, their own “houses,” as below. Each house had one of the heavenly bodies as its “lord,” who was
stronger, or better “located” in his own house than in any other. Also, of two planets equally strong in other
respects, that which was in the strongest house was the stronger. The strength of the houses was determined
by the order in which they rose, the strongest being that about to rise, which was called the ascendant.

we possibly say that for all the Geli Mars and Venus were posited in Aries, where it is written
that brave and wanton3437 men are born.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Bactrians.—Among the Bactrians, who are called Cashani, the women adorn
themselves with the goodly raiment of men, and with much gold, and with costly jewels;
and the slaves and handmaids minister to them more than to their husbands; and they ride
on horses decked out with trapping of gold and with precious stones.3438 These women,
moreover, do not practise continency, but have intimacies with their slaves, and with
strangers who go to that country; and their husbands do not find fault with them, nor have
the women themselves any fear of punishment, because the Cashani look upon3439 their
wives only as mistresses. Yet we cannot say that for all the Bactrian women Venus and Mars
and Jupiter are posited in the house of Mars in the middle of the heavens,3440 the place
where women are born that are rich and adulterous, and that make their husbands subservient
to them in everything.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Racami, and of the Edessæans, and of the Arabians.—Among the Racami,
and the Edessæans, and the Arabians, not only is she that commits adultery put to death,
but she also upon whom rests the suspicion3441 of adultery suffers capital punishment.</p>
<p>“Laws in Hatra.—There is a law in force3442 in Hatra, that whosoever steals any little
thing, even though it were worthless as water, shall be stoned. Among the Cashani, on the
contrary, if any one commits such a theft as this, they merely spit in his face. Among the
Romans, too, he that commits a small theft is scourged and sent about his business. On the
other side of the Euphrates, and as you go eastward, he that is stigmatized as either a thief

if any persons are thus stigmatized, and are known to be guilty, their own fathers and
brothers put them to death; and very often3445 they do not even make known the graves

<p>“Such are the laws of the people of the East. But in the North, and in the country of the
Gauls3446and their neighbours, such youths among them as are handsome the men take as
wives, and they even have feasts on the occasion; and it is not considered by them as a disgrace,
nor as a reproach, because of the law which prevails among them. But it is a thing impossible
that all those in Gaul who are branded with this disgrace should at their Nativities have had
Mercury posited with Venus in the house of Saturn, and within the limits of Mars, and in
the signs of the zodiac to the west. For, concerning such men as are born under these conditions,
it is written that they are branded with infamy, as being like women.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Britons.—Among the Britons many men take one and the same wife.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Parthians.—Among the Parthians, on the other hand, one man takes many
wives, and all of them keep to him only, because of the law which has been made there in
that country.</p>
<p>“Laws of the Amazons.—As regards the Amazons, they, all of them, the entire nation,
have no husbands; but like animals, once a year, in the spring-time, they issue forth from
their territories and cross the river; and, having crossed it, they hold a great festival on a
mountain, and the men from those parts come and stay with them fourteen days, and associate
with them, and they become pregnant by them, and pass over again to their own
country; and, when they are delivered, such of the children as are males they cast away, and
the females they bring up. Now it is evident that, according to the ordinance of Nature,
since they all became pregnant in one month, they also in one month are all delivered, a
little sooner or a little later; and, as we have heard, all of them are robust and warlike; but
not one of the stars is able to help any of those males who are born so as to prevent their
being cast away.</p>
<p>“The Book of the Astrologers.—It is written in the book of the astrologers, that, when
Mercury is posited with Venus in the house of Mercury, he produces painters, sculptors,

dancers, and singers, and poets. And yet, in all the country of the Tayites and of the Saracens,
and in Upper Libya and among the Mauritanians, and in the country of the Nomades, which
is at the mouth of the Ocean, and in outer Germany, and in Upper Sarmatia, and in Spain,
and in all the countries to the north of Pontus, and in all the country of the Alanians, and
among the Albanians, and among the Zazi, and in Brusa, which is beyond the Douro, one
sees neither sculptors, nor painters, nor perfumers, nor bankers, nor poets; but, on the contrary,
this decree of Mercury and Venus is prevented from influencing the entire circumference
of the world. In the whole of Media, all men when they die, and even while life is still
remaining in them, are cast to the dogs, and the dogs eat the dead of the whole of Media.
Yet we cannot say that all the Medians are born having the Moon posited with Mars in
Cancer in the day-time beneath the earth: for it is written that those whom dogs eat are so
born. The Hindoos, when they die, are all of them burnt with fire, and many of their wives
are burnt along with them alive. But we cannot say that all those women of the Hindoos
who are burnt had at their Nativity Mars and the Sun posited in Leo in the night-time beneath
the earth, as those persons are born who are burnt with fire. All the Germans die by strangulation,
3447 except those who are killed in battle. But it is a thing impossible, that, at the
Nativity of all the Germans the Moon and Hora should have been posited between Mars
and Saturn. The truth is, that in all countries, every day, and at all hours, men are born
under Nativities diverse from one another, and the laws of men prevail over the decree of
the stars, and they are governed by their customs. Fate does not compel the Seres to commit
murder against their wish, nor the Brahmans to eat flesh; nor does it hinder the Persians
from taking as wives their daughters and their sisters, nor the Hindoos from being burnt,
nor the Medes from being devoured by dogs, nor the Parthians from taking many wives,
nor among the Britons many men from taking one and the same wife, nor the Edessæans
from cultivating chastity, nor the Greeks from practising gymnastics,…, nor the Romans
from perpetually seizing upon other countries, nor the men of the Gauls from marrying one
another; nor does it compel the Amazons to rear the males; nor does his Nativity compel
any man within the circumference of the whole world to cultivate the art of the Muses; but,
as I have already said, in every country and in every nation all men avail themselves of the
freedom of their nature in any way they choose, and, by reason of the body with which they
are clothed, do service to Fate and to Nature, sometimes as they wish, and at other times as
they do not wish. For in every country and in every nation there are rich and poor, and
rulers and subjects, and people in health and those who are sick—each one according as
Fate and his Nativity have affected him.”</p>
<p>“Of these things, Father Bardesan,” said I to him, “thou hast convinced us, and we know

seven portions, which are called Zones; and that over the said portions those seven stars
have authority, each of them over one; and that in each one of the said portions the will of
its own Potentate prevails; and that this is called its law?”</p>
<p>“First of all, know thou, my son Philip,” said he to me, “that the astrologers have invented
this statement as a device for the promotion of error. For, although the earth be divided into
seven portions, yet in every one of the seven portions many laws are to be found differing
from one another. For there are not seven kinds of laws only found in the world, according
to the number of the seven stars; nor yet twelve, according to the number of the signs of the
zodiac; nor yet thirty-six, according to the number of the Decani.3448 But there are many
kinds of laws to be seen as you go from kingdom to kingdom, from country to country, from
district to district, and in every abode of man, differing one from another. For ye remember
what I said to you—that in one zone, that of the Hindoos, there are many men that do not
eat the flesh of animals, and there are others that even eat the flesh of men. And again, I
told you, in speaking of the Persians and the Magi, that it is not in the zone of Persia only
that they have taken for wives their daughters and their sisters, but that in every country to
which they have gone they have followed the law of their fathers, and have preserved the
mystic arts contained in that teaching which they delivered to them. And again, remember
that I told you of many nations spread abroad over the entire circuit of the world,3449 who
have not been confined to any one zone, but have dwelt in every quarter from which the
wind blows,3450 and in all the zones, and who have not the arts which Mercury and Venus
are said to have given when in conjunction with each other. Yet, if laws were regulated by
zones, this could not be; but they clearly are not: because those men I have spoken of are at
a wide remove from having anything in common with many other men in their habits of
life.</p>
<p>“Then, again, how many wise men, think ye, have abolished from their countries laws
which appeared to them not well made? How many laws, also, are there which have been
set aside through necessity? And how many kings are there who, when they have got possession
of countries which did not belong to them, have abolished their established laws,
and made such other laws as they chose? And, whenever these things occurred, no one of
the stars was able to preserve the law. Here is an instance at hand for you to see for
yourselves: it is but as yesterday since the Romans took possession of Arabia, and they abolished
all the laws previously existing there, and especially the circumcision which they
practised. The truth is,3451 that he who is his own master is sometimes compelled to obey

the law imposed on him by another, who himself in turn becomes possessed of the power
to do as he pleases.</p>
<p>“But let me mention to you a fact which more than anything else is likely3452 to convince
the foolish, and such as are wanting in faith. All the Jews, who received the law through
Moses, circumcise their male children on the eighth day, without waiting for the coming of
the proper stars, or standing in fear of the law of the country where they are living. Nor does
the star which has authority over the zone govern them by force; but, whether they be in
Edom, or in Arabia, or in Greece, or in Persia, or in the north, or in the south, they carry
out this law which was made for them by their fathers. It is evident that what they do is not
from Nativity: for it is impossible that for all the Jews, on the eighth day, on which they are
circumcised, Mars should ‘be in the ascendant,’ so that steel should pass upon them, and
their blood be shed. Moreover, all of them, wherever they are, abstain from paying reverence
to idols. One day in seven, also, they and their children cease from all work, from all
building, and from all travelling, and from all buying and selling; nor do they kill an animal
on the Sabbath-day, nor kindle a fire, nor administer justice; and there is not found among
them any one whom Fate compels,3453 either to go to law on the Sabbath-day and gain his
cause, or to go to law and lose it, or to pull down, or to build up, or to do any one of those
things which are done by all those men who have not received this law. They have also
other things in respect to which they do not on the Sabbath conduct themselves like the rest
of mankind, though on this same day they both bring forth and are born, and fall sick and
die: for these things do not pertain to the power of man.</p>
<p>“In Syria and in Edessa men used to part with their manhood in honour of Tharatha;
but, when King Abgar3454 became a believer he commanded that every one that did so
should have his hand cut off, and from that day until now no one does so in the country of
Edessa.</p>
<p>“And what shall we say of the new race of us Christians, whom Christ at His advent
planted in every country and in every region? for, lo! wherever we are, we are all called after
the one name of Christ—Christians. On one day, the first of the week, we assemble ourselves
together, and on the days of the readings3455 we abstain from taking sustenance. The
brethren who are in Gaul do not take males for wives, nor those who are in Parthia two
wives; nor do those who are in Judæa circumcise themselves; nor do our sisters who are

among the Geli consort with strangers; nor do those brethren who are in Persia take their
daughters for wives; nor do those who are in Media abandon their dead, or bury them alive,
or give them as food to the dogs; nor do those who are in Edessa kill their wives or their
sisters when they commit impurity, but they withdraw from them, and give them over to
the judgment of God; nor do those who are in Hatra3456 stone thieves to death; but, wherever
they are, and in whatever place they are found, the laws of the several countries do not hinder
them from obeying the law of their Sovereign, Christ; nor does the Fate of the celestial
Governors compel them to make use of things which they regard as impure.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, sickness and health, and riches and poverty, things which are not
within the scope of their freedom, befall them wherever they are. For although the freedom
of man is not influenced by the compulsion of the Seven, or, if at any time it is influenced,
it is able to withstand the influences exerted upon it, yet, on the other hand, this same man,
externally regarded,3457 cannot on the instant liberate himself from the command of his
Governors: for he is a slave and in subjection. For, if we were able to do everything, we
should ourselves be everything; and, if we had not the power to do anything, we should be
the tools of others.</p>
<p>“But, when God wills them, all things are possible, and they may take place without
hindrance: for there is nothing that can stay that Great and Holy Will. For even those who
think that they successfully withstand it, do not withstand it by strength, but by wickedness
and error. And this may go on for a little while, because He is kind and forbearing towards
all beings that exist,3458 so as to let them remain as they are, and be governed by their own
will, whilst notwithstanding they are held in check by the works which have been done and
by the arrangements which have been made for their help. For this well-ordered constitution
of things3459 and this government which have been instituted, and the intermingling of one
with another, serve to repress the violence of these beings,3460 so that they should not inflict
harm on one another to the full, nor yet to the full suffer harm, as was the case with them
before the creation of the world. A time is also coming when this propensity to inflict harm
which still remains in them shall be brought to an end, through the teaching which shall be
given them amidst intercourse of another kind. And at the establishment of that new world
all evil commotions shall cease, and all rebellions terminate, and the foolish shall be convinced,
and all deficiencies shall be filled up, and there shall be quietness and peace, through
the gift of the Lord of all existing beings.”</p>

<p>Here endeth the Book of the Laws of Countries.</p>
<p>Bardesan, therefore, an aged man, and one celebrated for his knowledge of events, wrote,
in a certain work which was composed by him, concerning the synchronisms3461 with one
another of the luminaries of heaven, speaking as follows:—</p>
<p>Two revolutions of Saturn,3462 60 years;</p>
<p>5 revolutions of Jupiter, 60 years;</p>
<p>40 revolutions of Mars, 60 years;</p>
<p>60 revolutions of the Sun, 60 years;</p>
<p>72 revolutions of Venus, 60 years;</p>
<p>150 revolutions of Mercury, 60 years;</p>
<p>720 revolutions of the Moon, 60 years.</p>
<p>And this,” says he, “is one synchronism of them all; that is, the time of one such synchronism
of them. So that from hence it appears that to complete 100 such synchronisms
there will be required six thousands of years. Thus:—</p>
<p>200 revolutions of Saturn, six thousands of years;</p>
<p>500 revolutions of Jupiter, 6 thousands of years;</p>
<p>4 thousand revolutions of Mars, 6 thousands of years;</p>
<p>Six thousand revolutions of the Sun, 6 thousands of years;</p>

<p>12 thousand revolutions of Mercury, 6 thousands of years;</p>

stand only six thousands of years.</p>

<p>A Letter of Mara, Son of Serapion.3463</p>
<p>Mara, son of Serapion, to Serapion, my son: peace.</p>
<p>When thy master and guardian wrote me a letter, and informed me that thou wast very
diligent in study, though so young in years, I blessed God that thou, a little boy, and without
a guide to direct thee, hadst begun in good earnest; and to myself also this was a comfort—that
I heard of thee, little boy as thou art, as displaying such greatness of mind and conscientiousness:
3464 a character which, in the case of many who have begun well, has shown no eagerness
to continue.</p>
<p>On this account, lo, I have written for thee this record, touching that which I have by
careful observation discovered in the world. For the kind of life men lead has been carefully
observed by me. I tread the path of learning,3465 and from the study of Greek philosophy3466
have I found out all these things, although they suffered shipwreck when the birth of life
took place.3467</p>
<p>Be diligent, then, my son, in attention to those things which are becoming for the free,3468
so as to devote thyself to learning, and to follow after wisdom; and endeavour thus to become
confirmed in those habits with which thou hast begun. Call to mind also my precepts, as a
quiet person who is fond of the pursuit of learning. And, even though such a life should
seem to thee very irksome, yet when thou hast made experience of it for a little while, it will
become very pleasant to thee: for to me also it so happened. When, moreover, a person
has left his home, and is able still to preserve his previous character, and properly does that
which it behoves him to do, he is that chosen man who is called “the blessing of God,” and
<note type="footnote">3463 [Elucidation I. p. 742, infra. See p. 722, supra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3464 Lit. “good conscience.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3465 Or, “my daily converse is with learning.” So Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to take these difficult words,
    supplying, as Cureton evidently does, the pronoun ***. The construction would be easier if we could take the
participle*** as a passive, and render: “It (the kind of life men lead) has been explored by me by means of
study.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3466 Lit. “Græcism.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3467 The meaning probably is, that the maxims referred to lost their importance for him when he entered
upon the new life of a Christian (so Cureton), or their importance to mankind when Christianity itself was born
into the world. But why he did not substitute more distinctive Christian teaching is not clear. Perhaps the fear
of persecution influenced him.</note>
<note type="footnote">3468 That is, the matters constituting “a liberal education.”</note>

<pb n="1982"/>
one who does not find aught else to compare with his freedom.3469 For, as for those persons
who are called to the pursuit of learning, they are seeking to extricate themselves from the
turmoils of time; and those who take hold upon wisdom, they are clinging to the hope of
righteousness; and those who take their stand on truth, they are displaying the banner of
their virtue; and those who cultivate philosophy, they are looking to escape from the vexations
of the world. And do thou too, my son, thus wisely behave thyself in regard to these things,
as a wise person who seeks to spend a pure life; and beware lest the gain which many hunger
after enervate thee, and thy mind turn to covet riches, which have no stability. For, when
they are acquired by fraud, they do not continue; nor, even when justly obtained, do they
last; and all those things which are seen by thee in the world, as belonging to that which is
only for a little time, are destined to depart like a dream: for they are but as the risings and
settings of the seasons.</p>
<p>About the objects of that vainglory, too, of which the life of men is full, be not thou solicitous:
seeing that from those things which give us joy there quickly comes to us harm.
Most especially is this the case with the birth of beloved children. For in two respects it
plainly brings us harm: in the case of the virtuous, our very affection for them torments us,
and from their very excellence of character we suffer torture; and, in the case of the vicious,
we are worried with their correction, and afflicted with their misconduct.</p>
<p>Thou hast heard,3470 moreover, concerning our companions, that, when they were
leaving Samosata, they were distressed about it, and, as if complaining of the time in which
their lot was cast, said thus: “We are now far removed from our home, and we cannot return
again to our city, or behold our people, or offer to our gods the greeting of praise.” Meet
was it that that day should be called a day of lamentation, because one heavy grief possessed
them all alike. For they wept as they remembered their fathers, and they thought of their
mothers3471 with sobs, and they were distressed for their brethren, and grieved for their
betrothed whom they had left behind. And, although we had heard that their3472 former
companions were proceeding to Seleucia, we clandestinely set out, and proceeded on the
way towards them, and united our own misery with theirs. Then was our grief exceedingly
violent, and fitly did our weeping abound, by reason of our desperate plight, and our wailing
gathered itself into a dense cloud,3473 and our misery grew vaster than a mountain: for not

fact that in each of the clauses the nominative is placed last, favours the rendering given.</note>

one of us had the power to ward off the disasters that assailed him. For affection for the
living was intense, as well as sorrow for the dead, and our miseries were driving us on without
any way of escape. For we saw our brethren and our children captives, and we remembered
our deceased companions, who were laid to rest in a foreign3474 land. Each one of us, too,
was anxious for himself, lest he should have disaster added to disaster, or lest another
calamity should overtake that which went before it. What enjoyment could men have that
were prisoners, and who experienced things like these?</p>
<p>But as for thee, my beloved, be not distressed because in thy loneliness thou hast3475
been driven from place to place. For to these things men are born, since they are destined
to meet with the accidents of time. But rather let thy thought be this, that to wise men every
place is alike, and that in every city the good have many fathers and mothers. Else, if thou
doubt it, take thee a proof from what thou hast seen thyself. How many people who know
thee not love thee as one of their own children; and what a host of women receive thee as
they would their own beloved ones! Verily, as a stranger thou hast been fortunate; verily,
for thy small love many people have conceived an ardent affection for thee.</p>
<p>What, again, are we to say concerning the delusion3476 which has taken up its abode in
the world? Both by reason of toil3477 painful is the journey through it, and by its agitations
are we, like a reed by the force of the wind, bent now in this direction, now in that. For I
have been amazed at many who cast away their children, and I have been astonished at
others who bring up those that are not theirs. There are persons who acquire riches in the
world, and I have also been astonished at others who inherit that which is not of their own
acquisition. Thus mayest thou understand and see that we are walking under the guidance
of delusion.</p>
<p>Begin and tell us, O wisest of men,3478 on which of his possessions a man can place reliance,
or concerning what things he can say that they are such as abide. Wilt thou say so
of abundance of riches? they are snatched away. Of fortresses? they are spoiled. Of cities?
they are laid waste. Of greatness? it is brought down. Of magnificence? it is overthrown.
Of beauty? it withers. Or of laws? they pass away. Or of poverty? it is despised. Or of children?
they die. Or of friends? they prove false. Or of the praises of men? jealousy goes before
them.</p>

<p>Let a man, therefore, rejoice in his empire, like Darius; or in his good fortune, like
Polycrates; or in his bravery, like Achilles; or in his wife, like Agamemnon; or in his offspring,
like Priam; or in his skill, like Archimedes; or in his wisdom, like Socrates; or in his learning,
like Pythagoras; or in his ingenuity, like Palamedes;—the life of men, my son, departs from
the world, but their praises and their virtues abide for ever.</p>
<p>Do thou, then, my little son, choose thee that which fadeth not away. For those who
occupy themselves with these things are called modest, and are beloved, and lovers of a good
name.</p>
<p>When, moreover, anything untoward befalls thee, do not lay the blame on man, nor be
angry against God, nor fulminate against the time thou livest in.</p>
<p>If thou shalt continue in this mind, thy gift is not small which thou hast received from
God, which has no need of riches, and is never reduced to poverty. For without fear shalt
thou pass thy life,3479 and with rejoicing. For fear and apologies for one’s nature belong not
to the wise, but to such as walk contrary to law. For no man has even been deprived of his
wisdom, as of his property.</p>
<p>Follow diligently learning rather than riches. For the greater are one’s possessions, the
greater is the evil attendant upon them. For I have myself observed that, where a man’s
goods are many, so also are the tribulations which happen to him; and, where luxuries are
accumulated, there also do sorrows congregate; and, where riches are abundant, there is
stored up the bitterness of many a year.</p>
<p>If, therefore, thou shalt behave with understanding, and shalt diligently watch over thy
conduct, God will not refrain from helping thee, nor men from loving thee.</p>
<p>Let that which thou art able to acquire suffice thee; and if, moreover, thou art able to
do without property, thou shalt be called blessed, and no man whatsoever shall be jealous
of thee.</p>
<p>And remember also this, that nothing will disturb thy life very greatly, except it be the
love of gain; and that no man after his death is called an owner of property: because it is by
the desire of this that weak men are led captive, and they know not that a man dwells among
his possessions only in the manner of a chance-comer, and they are haunted with fear because
these possessions are not secured to them: for they abandoned that which is their own, and
seek that which is not theirs.</p>
<p>What are we to say, when the wise are dragged by force by the hands of tyrants, and
their wisdom is deprived of its freedom3480 by slander, and they are plundered for their
superior intelligence, without the opportunity of making a defence? They are not wholly to
be pitied. For what benefit did the Athenians obtain by putting Socrates to death, seeing
<note type="footnote">3479 ***.</note>
<note type="footnote">3480 Lit., “made captive.”</note>

<pb n="1985"/>
that they received as retribution for it famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by
the burning of Pythagoras, seeing that in one hour the whole3481 of their country was covered
with sand? Or the Jews by the murder of their Wise King, seeing that from that very time
their kingdom was driven away from them? For with justice did God grant a recompense
to the wisdom of all three of them. For the Athenians died by famine; and the people of
Samos were covered by the sea without remedy; and the Jews, brought to desolation and
expelled from their kingdom, are driven away into every land. Nay, Socrates did “not” die,
because of Plato; nor yet Pythagoras, because of the statue of Hera; nor yet the Wise King,
because of the new laws which he enacted.</p>
<p>Moreover I, my son, have attentively observed mankind, in what a dismal state of ruin
they are. And I have been amazed that they are not utterly prostrated3482 by the calamities
which surround them, and that even their wars3483 are not enough for them, nor the pains
they endure, nor the diseases, nor the death, nor the poverty; but that, like savage beasts,
they must needs rush upon one another in their enmity, trying which of them shall inflict
the greater mischief on his fellow. For they have broken away from the bounds of truth,
and transgress all honest laws, because they are bent on fulfilling their selfish desires; for,
whensoever a man is eagerly set on obtaining that which he desires, how is it possible that
he should fitly do that which it behoves him to do? and they acknowledge no restraint,3484
and but seldom stretch out their hands towards truth and goodness, but in their manner of
life behave like the deaf3485 and the blind. Moreover, the wicked rejoice, and the righteous
are disquieted. He that has, denies that he has; and he that has not, struggles to acquire.
The poor seek help, and the rich hide their wealth, and every man laughs at his fellow. Those
that are drunken are stupefied, and those that have recovered themselves are ashamed.3486
Some weep, and some sing; and some laugh, and others are a prey to care. They rejoice in
things evil, and a man that speaks the truth they despise.</p>
<p>Should a man, then, be surprised when the world is seeking to wither him with its scorn,
seeing that they and he have not one and the same manner of life? “These” are the things
for which they care. One of them is looking forward to the time when in battle he shah obtain
the renown of victory; yet the valiant perceive not by how many foolish objects of desire a
man is led captive in the world. But would that for a little while self-repentance visited

them! For, while victorious by their bravery, they are overcome by the power of covetousness.
For I have made trial of men, and with this result: that the one thing on which they
are intent, is abundance of riches. Therefore also it is that they have no settled purpose;
but, through the instability of their minds, a man is of a sudden cast down from his elation
of spirit to be swallowed up with sadness. They look not at the vast wealth of eternity, nor
consider that every visitation of trouble is conducting us all alike to the same final period.
For they are devoted to the majesty of the belly, that huge blot on the character of the vicious.</p>
<p>Moreover, as regards this letter which it has come into my mind to write to thee, it is
not enough to read it, but the best thing is that it be put in practice.3487 For I know for
myself, that when thou shalt have made experiment of this mode of life, it will be very
pleasant to thee, and thou wilt be free from sore vexation; because it is only on account of
children that we tolerate riches.3488</p>
<p>Put, therefore, sadness away from thee, O most beloved of mankind,—a thing which
never in anywise benefits a man; and drive care away from thee, which brings with it no
advantage whatsoever. For we have no resource or skill that can avail us—nothing but a
great mind able to cope with the disasters and to endure the tribulations which we are always
receiving at the hands of the times. For at these things does it behove us to look, and not
only at those which are fraught with rejoicing and good repute.</p>
<p>Devote thyself to wisdom, the fount of all things good, the treasure that faileth not.
There shalt thou lay thy head, and be at ease. For this shall be to thee father and mother,
and a good companion for thy life.</p>
<p>Enter into closest intimacy with fortitude and patience, those virtues which are able
successfully to encounter the tribulations that befall feeble men. For so great is their strength,
that they are adequate to sustain hunger, and can endure thirst, and mitigate every trouble.
With toil, moreover, yea even with dissolution, they make right merry.</p>
<p>To these things give diligent attention, and thou shalt lead an untroubled life, and I also
shall have comfort,3489 and thou shalt be called “the delight of his parents.”</p>
<p>For in that time of yore, when our city was standing in her greatness, thou mayest be
aware that against many persons among us abominable words were uttered; but for
ourselves,3490 we acknowledged long ago that we received love, no less than honour, to the

fullest extent from the multitude of her people: it was the state of the times only that forbade
our completing those things which we had resolved on doing.3491 And here also in the

striving to our utmost to maintain a life of sobriety and cheerfulness;3492 and, if anyone

from all things good, and he will receive disgrace and shame from the foul mark of shame
that is upon him. For we have shown our truth—that truth which in our now ruined kingdom
we possessed not.3493 But, if the Romans shall permit us to go back to our own country, as
called upon by justice and righteousness to do, they will be acting like humane men, and
will earn the name of good and righteous, and at the same time will have a peaceful country
in which to dwell: for they will exhibit their greatness when they shall leave us free men,
and we shall be obedient to the sovereign power which the time has allotted to us. But let
them not like tyrants, drive us as though we were slaves. Yet, if it has been already determined
what shall be done, we shall receive nothing more dreadful than the peaceful death which
is in store for us.</p>
<p>But thou, my little son, if thou resolve diligently to acquaint thyself with these things,
first of all put a check on appetite, and set limits to that in which thou art indulging. Seek
the power to refrain from being angry; and, instead of yielding to outbursts of passion, listen
to the promptings of kindness.</p>
<p>For myself, what I am henceforth solicitous about is this—that, so far as I have recollections
of the past, I may leave behind me a book containing them, and with a prudent mind
finish the journey which I am appointed to take, and depart without suffering out of the sad
afflictions of the world. For my prayer is, that I may receive my dismissal; and by what kind
of death concerns me not. But, if any one should be troubled or anxious about this, I have
no counsel to give him: for yonder, in the dwelling-place of all the world, will he find us
before him.</p>

that we received equal love and honour to the fullest extent from her multitude” (or, from her greatness); “but
the time forbade our completing those things which were already accomplished in our mind.” What things he
refers to (for his words seem to have a particular reference) is not clear. The word rendered “greatness,” or
“multitude,” is in reality two words in pointedmss. Here it does not appear, except from the sense, which is intended.</note>

<p>A memorial3496 a which Ambrose, a chief man of Greece, wrote: who became a Christian,
and all his fellow-senators raised an outcry against him; and he fled from them, and
wrote and pointed out to them all their foolishness.</p>
<p>Beginning his discourse,3497 he answered and said:—</p>
<p>Think not, men of Greece, that my separation from your customs has been made without
a just and proper reason. For I acquainted myself with all your wisdom, consisting of poetry,
of oratory, of philosophy; and when I found not there anything agreeable to what is right,
or that is worthy of the divine nature, I resolved to make myself acquainted with the wisdom
of the Christians also, and to learn and see who they are, and when they took their rise, and
what is the nature of this new and strange wisdom of theirs,3498 or on what good hopes those
who are imbued with it rely, that they speak only that which is true.</p>
<p>Men of Greece, when I came to examine the Christian writings, I found not any folly3499
in them, as I had found in the celebrated Homer, who has said concerning the wars of the
two trials:3500 “Because of Helen, many of the Greeks perished at Troy, away from their
beloved home.”3501 For, first of all, we are told3502 concerning Agamemnon their king,

neither of the two pieces is the original composition: for each contains something not found in the other; (2)
That the original was in Greek: for the Syriac has in some instances evidently mistranslated the Greek.</note>

similar in sound to that found in the text, explaining it of heathen peoples, Gentiles (comp. Tertullian, De Idol.,

and the uncontrollable nature of his passion, he resolved to go and rescue Helen from the
hands of a certain leprous3503 shepherd; and afterwards, when the Greeks had become victorious
in the war, and burnt cities, and taken women and children captive, and the land
was filled with blood, and the rivers with corpses, Agamemnon himself also was found to
be taken captive by his passion for Briseis. Patroclus, again, we are told, was slain, and
Achilles, the son of the goddess Thetis, mourned over him; Hector was dragged along the
ground, and Priam and Hecuba together were weeping over the loss of their children;
Astyanax, the son of Hector, was thrown down from the walls of Ilion, and his mother Andromache
the mighty Ajax bore away into captivity; and that which was taken as booty was
after a little while, all squandered in sensual indulgence.</p>
<p>Of the wiles of Odysseus the son of Laertes, and of his murders, who shall tell the tale?
For of a hundred and ten suitors did his house in one day become the grave, and it was filled
with corpses and blood. He, too, it was that by his wickedness gained the praises of men,
because through his pre-eminence in craft he escaped detection; he, too, it was who, you
say, sailed upon the sea, and heard not the voice of the Sirens only because he stopped his
ears with wax.3504</p>
<p>The famous Achilles, again, the son of Peleus, who bounded across the river, and
routed3505 the Trojans, and slew Hector,—this said hero of yours became the slave of
Philoxena, and was overcome by an Amazon as she lay dead and stretched upon her bier;
and he put off his armour, and arrayed himself in nuptial garments, and finally fell a sacrifice
to love.</p>
<p>Thus much concerning your great “men;”3506 and thou, Homer, hadst deserved forgiveness,
if thy silly story-telling had gone so far only as to prate about men, and not about the
gods. As for what he says about the gods, I am ashamed even to speak of it: for the stories
that have been invented about them are very wicked and shocking; passing strange,3507 too,
and not to be believed; and, if the truth must be told,3508 fit only to be laughed at. For a

person will be compelled to laugh when he meets with them, and will not believe them when
he hears them. For think of gods who did not one of them observe the laws of rectitude, or
of purity, or of modesty, but were adulterers, and spent their time in debauchery, and yet
were not condemned to death, as they ought to have been!</p>
<p>Why, the sovereign of the gods, the very “father of gods and men,” not only, as ye say,
was an adulterer (this was but a light thing), but even slew his own father, and was a
pæderast. I will first of all speak of his adultery, though I blush to do so: for he appeared to
Antiope as a satyr, and descended upon Danaë as a shower of gold, and became a bull for
Europa, and a swan for Leda; whilst the love of Semele, the mother of Dionysus, exposed
both his own ardency of passion and the jealousy of the chaste Hera. Ganymede the
Phrygian, too, he carried off disguised as an eagle, that the fair and comely boy, forsooth,
might serve as cup-bearer to him. This said sovereign of the gods, moreover killed his
father Kronos, that he might seize upon his kingdom.</p>
<p>Oh! to how many charges is the sovereign of the gods amenable,3509 and how many
deaths does he deserve to die, as an adulterer, and as a sorcerer,3510 and as a pæderast! Read
to the sovereign of the gods, O men of Greece, the law concerning parricide, and the condemnation
pronounced on adultery, and about the shame that attaches to the vile sin of
pæderasty. How many adulterers has the sovereign of the gods indoctrinated in sin! Nay,
how many pæderasts, and sorcerers, and murderers! So that, if a man be found indulging
his passions, he must not be put to death: because he has done this that he may become
like the sovereign of the gods; and, if he be found a murderer, he has an excuse in the sovereign
of the gods; and, if a man be a sorcerer, he has learned it from the sovereign of the gods;
and, if he be a pæderast, the sovereign of the gods is his apologist. Then, again, if one should
speak of courage, Achilles was more valiant that this said sovereign of the gods: for he slew
the man that slew his friend; but the sovereign of the gods wept over Sarpedon his son when
he was dying, being distressed for him.</p>
<p>Pluto, again, who is a god, carried off Kora,3511 and the mother of Kora was hurrying
hither and thither searching for her daughter in all desert places; and, although Alexander
Paris, when he had carried off Helen, paid the penalty of vengeance, as having made himself
her lover by force, yet Pluto, who is a god, when he carried off Kora, remained without rebuke;
and, although Menelaus, who is a man, knew how to search for Helen his wife, yet Demeter,
who is a goddess, knew not where to search for Kora her daughter.</p>
<note type="footnote">3509 Lit., “of how many censures is…full.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3510 Since he could change his form to suit his purpose.</note>

Attica.</note>

<p>Let Hephæstus put away jealousy from him, and not indulge resentment.3512 For he
was hated,3513 because he was old and lame; while Ares was loved, because he was a youth
and beautiful in form. There was, however, a reproof administered in respect of the adultery.
Hephæstus was not, indeed, at first aware of the love existing between Venus3514 his wife
and Ares; but, when he did become acquainted with it, Hephæstus said: “Come, see a ridiculous
and senseless piece of behaviour—how to me, who am her own, Venus, the daughter
of the sovereign of the gods, is offering insult—to me, I say, who am her own, and is paying
honour to Ares, who is a stranger to her.” But to the sovereign of the gods it was not displeasing:
for he loved such as were like these. Penelope, moreover, remained a widow
twenty years, because she was expecting the return of her husband Odysseus, and busied
herself with cunning tasks,3515 and persevered in works of skill, while all those suitors kept
pressing her to marry them; but Venus, who is a goddess, when Hephæstus her husband
was close to her, deserted him, because she was overcome by love for Ares. Hearken, men
of Greece: which of you would have dared to do this, or would even have endured to see
it? And, if any one “should” dare to act so, what torture would be in store for him, or what
scourgings!</p>
<p>Kronos, again, who is a god, who devoured all those children of his, was not even brought
before a court of justice. They further tell us that the sovereign of the gods, his son, was the
only one that escaped from him; and that the madness of Kronos his father was cheated of
its purpose because Rhea his wife, the mother of the sovereign of the gods, offered him a
stone in the place of the said sovereign of the gods, his son, to prevent him from devouring
him. Hearken, men of Greece, and reflect upon this madness! Why, even the dumb animal
that grazes in the field knows its proper food, and does not touch strange food; the wild
beast, too, and the reptile, and the bird, know their food. As for men, I need not say anything
about them: ye yourselves are acquainted with their food, and understand it well. But
Kronos, who is a god, not knowing his proper food, ate up a stone!</p>
<p>Therefore, O men of Greece, if ye will have such gods as these, do not find fault with
one another when ye do such-like things. Be not angry with thy son when he forms the
design to kill thee: because he thus resembles the sovereign of the gods. And, if a man
commit adultery with thy wife, why dost thou think of him as an enemy, and yet to the
sovereign of the gods, who is like him, doest worship and service? Why, too, dost thou find
fault with thy wife when she has committed adultery and leads a dissolute life,3516 and yet

payest honour to Venus, and placest her images in shrines? Persuade your Solon to repeal
his laws; Lycurgus, also, to make no laws; let the Areopagus repeal3517 theirs, and judge no
more; and let the Athenians have councils no longer. Let the Athenians discharge Socrates
from his office: for no one like Kronos has ever come before him. Let them not put to death
Orestes, who killed his mother: for, lo! the sovereign of the gods did worse things than these
to his father. OEdipus also too hastily inflicted mischief on himself, in depriving his eyes of
sight, because he had killed his mother unwittingly: for he did not think about3518 the
sovereign of the gods, who killed his father and yet remained without punishment. Medea,
again, who killed her children, the Corinthians banish from their country; and yet they do
service and honour to Kronos, who devoured his children. Then, too, as regards Alexander
Paris—he was right in carrying off Helen: for he did it that he might become like Pluto, who
carried off Kora. Let your men be set free from law, and let your cities be the abode of
wanton women, and a dwelling-place for sorcerers.</p>
<p>Wherefore, O men of Greece, seeing that your gods are grovelling like yourselves, and
your heroes destitute of courage,3519 as your dramas tell and your stories declare—then,
again, what shall be said of the tribulations of Orestes; and the couch of Thyestes; and the
foul taint in the family of Pelops; and concerning Danaus, who through jealousy killed his
sons-in-law, and deprived them of offspring; the banquet of Thyestes, too, feeding upon the
corpse set before him by way of vengeance for her whom he had wronged; about Procne also,
to this hour screaming as she flies; her sister too, warbling, with her tongue cut out?3520
What, moreover, is it fitting to say about the murder committed by OEdipus, who took his
own mother to wife, and whose brothers killed one another, they being at the same time his
sons?</p>
<p>Your festivals, too, I hate; for there is no moderation where they are; the sweet flutes
also, dispellers of care, which play as an incitement to dancing;3521 and the preparation of
ointments, wherewith ye anoint yourselves; and the chaplets which ye put on. In the
abundance of your wickedness, too, ye have forgotten shame, and your understandings have
become blinded, and ye have been infuriated3522 by the heat of passion, and have loved the
adulterous bed.3523</p>

fraught with comfort. Rejoice, and become partakers of it. Acquaint yourselves with the
King Immortal, and acknowledge His servants. For not in arms do they make their boast,
nor do they commit murders: because our Commander has no delight in abundance of
strength, nor yet in horsemen and their gallant array, nor yet in illustrious descent; but He
delights in the pure soul, fenced round by a rampart of righteousness. The word of God,
moreover, and the promises of our good King, and the works of God, are ever teaching us.
Oh the blessedness of the soul that is redeemed by the power of the word! Oh the blessedness
of the trumpet of peace without war! Oh the blessedness of the teaching which quenches the
fire of appetite! which, though it makes not poets, nor fits men to be philosophers, nor has
among its votaries the orators of the crowd; yet instructs men, and makes the dead not to

<p>I.
(Mara, son of Serapion, p. 735.)</p>
<p>I cannot withhold from the student the valuable hints concerning “the dialect of Edessa”
by which Professor Nöldke3524 corrects the loose ideas of Mommsen, more especially because
the fresh work of Mommsen will soon be in our hands, and general credit will be attached
to specious representations which are sure to have a bearing on his ulterior treatment of
Christianity and the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Of the Syriac language Professor Nöldke says:—</p>
<p>“It was the living language of Syria which here appears as the language of writing. In
Syria it had long ago been compelled to yield to the Greek as the official language, but private
writings were certainly yet to a great extent written in Aramaic. We cannot lay much stress
upon the fact that the respectable citizen in the Orient would have the schoolmaster of the
village compose a Greek inscription for his tomb, of which he undoubtedly understood but
little himself. And what a Greek this often was! That no books written by Aramaic Gentiles
have been preserved for us, does not decide against the existence of the Aramaic as the language
of literature in that day; for how could such Gentile works have been preserved for
us? To this must be added, that that particular dialect which afterward became the common
literary language of Aramaic Christendom—namely, that of Edessa—certainly had in the
Gentile period already been used for literary purposes. The official report of the great flood
in the year 201, which is prefixed to the Edessa Chronicles, is written by a Gentile. To the
same time must be ascribed the letter, written in good Edessan language by the finely educated
Marâ bar Serapion, from the neighbouring Samosata, who, notwithstanding his good-will
toward youthful Christianity, was no Christian, but represented rather the ethical standpoint
of the Stoicism so popular at that time. The fixed settling of Syriac orthography must
have taken place at a much earlier period than the hymns of Bardesanes and his school,
which are for us very old specimens of that language, since these hymns represent a versification
much younger than the stage of development which is presupposed in this orthography.
In general, it must be granted that the dialect of Edessa had been thoroughly developed already
in pre-Christian times; otherwise, it could not have been so fixed and firm in writing and
forms of expression. And the Syriac Dialogue on Fate, which presupposes throughout the
third century, treats of scientific questions, according to Greek models, with such precision
that we again see that this was not the beginning, but rather the close, of a scientific Syriac
<note type="footnote">3524 For previous quotations refer to p. 721, supra.</note>

<pb n="1996"/>
literature, which flourished already when there were but few or possibly no Christians there.
Of course I recognise, with Mommsen, that Edessa offered a better protection to the national
language and literature than did the cities of Syria proper; but circumstances were not altogether
of a different nature in this regard in Haleb, Hems, and Damascus than they were in
Edessa and Jerusalem. If, as is known, the common mass spoke Aramaic in the metropolitan
city of Antiochia, it cannot safely be accepted that in the inland districts the Greek was not
the language of the ‘educated,’ but only of those who had specially learned it. The Macedonian
and Greek colonists have certainly only in a very small part retained this language in
those districts down to the Roman period. In most cases they have been in a minority from
the beginning over against the natives. Further, as the descendants of old soldiers, they can
scarcely be regarded as the called watchmen of Greek custom and language.”</p>

<pb n="1997"/>
<p>II.
(No verb is found in the lexicons, etc., note 3, p. 737.)</p>
<p>The study of Syriac is just beginning to be regarded as only less important to the theologian
than that of the Hebrew. The twain will be found a help, each to the other, if one
pursues the study of the cognate languages together. In fact, the Book of Daniel demands
such a preparation for its enjoyment and adequate comprehension.3525 Let me commend
to every reader the admirable example of Beveridge, who at eighteen years of age produced
a grammar of the Syriac language, and also a Latin essay on the importance of cultivating
this study, as that of the vernacular of our Lord Himself. This little treatise is worthy of
careful reading; and right worthy of note is the motto which he prefixed to it,—“Estote imitatores
mei, sicut et ego sum Christi” (1 Cor. xi. 1).</p>
<p>When one thinks of the difficulties even yet to be overcome in mastering the language,—
the want of a complete lexicon, etc.,3526—it is surprising to think of Beveridge’s
pioneer labours in extreme youth. Gutbir’s Lexicon Syriacum had not yet appeared, nor his
edition of the Peshito, which preceded it, though Brian Walton’s great name and labours
were his noble stimulants. Nobody can read the touching account which Gutbir3527 gives
of his own enthusiastic and self-sacrificing work, without feeling ashamed of the slow progress
of Oriental studies in the course of two centuries since the illustrious Pocock gave his grand
example to English scholarship. All honour to our countryman Dr. Murdock, who late in
life entered upon this charming pursuit, and called on others to follow him.3528 May I not
venture to hope that even these specimens of what may be reaped from the field of Aramaic
literature may inspire my young countrymen to take the lead in elucidating the Holy
Scriptures from this almost unopened storehouse of “treasures new and old”?</p>
<note type="footnote">3525 It must not be inferred that I speak as a Syriac scholar. I have laboured unsuccessfully, and late in life,
to repair my sad neglect at an earlier period; and I can speak only as a penitent.</note>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Remains of the Second and Third Centuries.</head>
<p>Under the title of Fragments of the Second and Third Centuries are grouped together,
in the Edinburgh series, a mass of valuable illustrative material, which might have been
distributed with great advantage through the former volumes, in strict order of chronology.
Something is due, however, to the unity of authorship, and to the marked design of the editors
of the original edition to let these Fragments stand together, as the work of their accomplished
collaborator, the Rev. B. P. Pratten, with whose skill and erudition our readers are
already familiar.3529</p>
<p>I have contented myself, therefore, with giving approximate order and continuity, on
chronological grounds, to the series of names subjoined. Bardesanes has been eliminated
here, and placed more appropriately with the Syriac authors. The reader will find references
which may aid him in seeking further information. Some of these names are of lasting value
and interest in the Church. I prefer to call these “Fragments” their “Remains.”</p>
<p>To each of the following names I have prefixed some details of information, with such
dates as the learned supply.</p>
<p>The following is the
Translator’s Introductory Notice
The fragments that follow are the productions of writers who lived during the second
century or the beginning of the third. Little is known of the writers, and the statements
made in regard to them are often very indefinite, and the result of mere conjecture.</p>
<p>1. Quadratus was one of the first of the Christian apologists. He is said to have
presented his apology to Hadrian while the emperor was in Athens attending the celebration
of the Eleusinian mysteries.</p>
<p>2. Aristo of Pella, a Jew, was the author of a work called The Disputation of Jason and
Papiscus. Nothing further is known of him. He flourished in the first half of the second
century.</p>
<p>3. Melito was bishop of Sardis, and flourished in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He

<p>4. Hegesippus also flourished in the time of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. He
is the first ecclesiastical historian; but his book was rather notes for an ecclesiastical history,
than a history.</p>
<p>5. Dionysius was bishop of Corinth in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He wrote letters
to various churches.</p>
<p>6. Rhodon went from Asia to Rome, and became a pupil of Tatian. After the lapse of
his master into heresy he remained true to the faith, and wrote against heretics.</p>
<p>7. Maximus flourished about the same time as Rhodon, under the emperors Commodus
and Severus.</p>
<p>8. Claudius Apollinaris was bishop of Hierapolis, and presented a defense of the
Christians to Marcus Aurelius. He wrote many important works, of which we have only a
few fragments.</p>
<p>9. Polycrates was bishop of Ephesus. He took part in the controversy on the Passover
question. He died about 200 a.d.</p>
<p>10. Theophilus was bishop of Cæsarea. He was a contemporary of Polycrates, and, like
him, engaged in the Passover controversy.</p>
<p>11. Serapion was ordained bishop of Antioch a.d. 190, but almost no other fact of his
life is known. He wrote several works.</p>
<p>12. Apollonius wrote a work against the Montanists, probably in the year a.d. 210. This
is all that is known of him.</p>
<p>13. Pantænus, probably a Sicilian by birth, passed from Stoicism to Christianity, and
went to Judæa to proclaim the truth. He returned to Alexandria, and became president of
the catechetical school there, in which post he remained till his death, which took place
about the year 212 a.d.</p>
<p>14. The Letter of the Churches in Vienne and Lyons was written shortly after the persecution
in Gaul, which took place in a.d. 177. It is not known who is the author. Some have
supposed that Irenæus wrote it, but there is no historical testimony to this effect.</p>

Apostolic faith.” And he celebrates Aristides as a man of similar character. These were the

<p>Our Saviour’s works, moreover, were always present: for they were real, consisting of
those who had been healed of their diseases, those who had been raised from the dead; who
were not only seen whilst they were being healed and raised up, but were afterwards constantly
present. Nor did they remain only during the sojourn of the Saviour on earth, but
also a considerable time after His departure; and, indeed, some of them have survived even
down to our own times.3533</p>

<head>Aristo of Pella.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 140.</del> Aristo of Pella3534 is supposed to have been a Jew, whose work was designed
to help the failing Judaism of his country. Though his work is lost, alike the original and
the Latin translation of one “Celsus,” it seems to have been a popular tract among Christians
of Cyprian’s time, and the Latin preface is often suffixed to editions of that Father.</p>
<p>The work of Aristo is known as the Disputation of Papiscus and Jason, and Celsus tells
us that Jason was a Hebrew Christian, while his opponent was a Jew of Alexandria. Now,
Papiscus owns himself convinced by the arguments of Jason, and concludes by a request to
be baptized. Celsus, who seems to have been a heathen or an Epicurean, derides the work
with scornful commiseration; but Origen rebukes this, and affirms his respect for the work.
All this considered, one must think Aristo was “almost persuaded to be a Christian,” and
deserves a place among Christian writers.</p>
<p>From the Disputation of Jason and Papiscus.</p>
<p>“I remember,” says Jerome (Comm. ad Gal., cap. iii. comm. 13), “in the Dispute between
Jason and Papiscus, which is composed in Greek, to have found it written: ‘The execration
of God is he that is hanged.’”
From the Same Work.</p>
<p>Jerome likewise, in his Hebrew Questions on Genesis, says: “In the beginning God made
the heaven and the earth. The majority believe, as it is affirmed also in the Dispute between
Jason and Papiscus, and as Tertullian in his book Against Praxeas contends, and as Hilarius
too, in his exposition of one of the Psalms, declares, that in the Hebrew it is: ‘In the Son,
God made the heaven and the earth.’ But that this is false, the nature of the case itself proves.”
Perhaps from the Same Work.</p>
<p>…And when the man himself3535 who had instigated them3536 to this folly had paid
the just penalty (says Eusebius, Hist., iv. 6), “the whole nation from that time was strictly
forbidden to set foot on the region about Jerusalem, by the formal decree and enactment of
Adrian, who commanded that they should not even from a distance look on their native
soil!” So writes Aristo of Pella.</p>

the Mystical Theology, ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, cap. i.) also in the Dispute
between Papiscus and Jason, written by Aristo of Pella, which Clement of Alexandria, in the
sixth book of the Outlines,3537 says was composed by Saint Luke.</p>
<p>Concerning the Same Work.</p>
<p>Thus writes Origen:3538…in which book a Christian is represented disputing with a Jew
from the Jewish Scriptures, and showing that the prophecies concerning the Christ apply
to Jesus: although his opponent addresses himself to the argument with no common ability,
3539 and in a manner not unbefitting his Jewish character.</p>

<head>Melito, the Philosopher.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 160–170–177.</del> Melito3540 may have been the immediate successor of the “angel”
(or “apostle”) of the church of Sardis, to whom our Great High Priest addressed one of the
apocalyptic messages. He was an “Apostolic Father” in point of fact; he very probably knew
the blessed Polycarp and his disciple Irenæus. He is justly revered for the diligence with
which he sought out the evidence which, in his day, established the Canon of the Old Testament,
then just complete.</p>
<p>In the following fragments we find him called Bishop of Sardis, Bishop of Attica, and
Bishop of Ittica. He is also introduced to us as “the Philosopher,” and we shall find him
styled “the Eunuch” by Polycrates. It is supposed that he had made himself a coelebs “for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake,” without mistaking our Lord’s intent, as did Origen. He was
not a monk, but accepted a single estate to be the more free and single-eyed in the Master’s
service. From the encyclopedic erudition of Lightfoot we glean some particulars, as follows:—</p>
<p>1. I have adopted his date, as Lightfoot gives it,—that is, the period of his writings,—under
the Antonines. The improbability of seventy years in the episcopate is reason enough
for rejecting the idea that he was himself the “angel of the church of Sardis,” to whom our
Lord sent the terrible rebuke.</p>
<p>2. His silence concerning persecutions under Vespasian, Trojan, and Antoninus Pius
cannot be pleaded to exempt them from this stain, against positive evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>3. A coincidence with Ignatius to the Ephesians3541 will be noted hereafter.</p>
<p>4. Melito, with Claudius Apollinaris and even Polycrates, may have been personally
acquainted with Ignatius;3542 of course, one with another. These lived not far from Smyrna;
Asia Minor was, in the first century, the focus of Christian activity.</p>
<p>5. We know of his visit to the East from his own account, preserved by Eusebius. The
Christians of proconsular Asia were accustomed to such journeys. Even Clement of Alexandria
may have met him, as he seems to have met Tatian and Theodotus.3543</p>
<p>6. Melito vouches for the rescript of Hadrian,3544 but his supposed reference to the
edict of Antoninus does not bear close scrutiny as warrant for its authenticity.3545</p>
<p>7. The Apology of our author was addressed to Aurelius in his mid-career as a sovereign,
about a.d. 170. Justin, Melito, Athenagoras, and Theophilus all tell the same sad story of

<head>I.
A Discourse Which Was in the Presence of Antoninus Cæsar, and He Exhorted3548
The Said Cæsar to Acquaint Himself with God, and Showed to Him the Way of
Truth.</head>
<p>He began to speak as follows:—</p>
<p>“It is not easy,” said Melito, “speedily to bring into the right way the man who has a
long time previously been held fast by error. It may, however, be effected: for, when a man
turns away ever so little from error, the mention of the truth is acceptable to him. For, just
as when the cloud breaks ever so little there comes fair weather, even so, when a man turns
toward God, the thick cloud of error which deprived him of true vision is quickly withdrawn
from before him. For error, like disease3549 and sleep, long holds fast those who come under
its influence;3550 but truth uses the word as a goad, and smites the slumberers, and awakens
them; and when they are awake they look at the truth, and also understand it: they hear,
and distinguish that which is from that which is not. For there are men who call iniquity
righteousness: they think, for example, that it is righteousness for a man to err with the
many. But I, for my part, affirm that it is not a good excuse for error that a man errs with
the many. For, if one man only sin,3551 his sin is great: how much greater will be the sin
when many sin together!</p>
<p>“Now, the sin of which I speak is this: when a man abandons that which really exists,
and serves that which does not really exist. There ‘is’ that which really exists, and it is called
God. He, I say, really exists, and by His power doth everything subsist. This being is in no
sense made, nor did He ever come into being; but He has existed from eternity, and will
continue to exist for ever and ever. He changeth not, while everything else changes. No
eye3552 can see Him, nor thought apprehend Him, nor language describe Him; and those
who love Him speak of Him thus: ‘Father, and God of Truth.’</p>
<note type="footnote">3548 “Which was delivered in the presence…and in which etc.” This appears to be the sense intended, and
is that given by M. Renan: “Sermo qui factus est.” Cureton renders, “Who was in the presence, etc.,” and supposes
that Melito first saw and conversed with the emperor, and afterwards wrote this discourse. Melito speaks of it
more than once as written. This view, however, does not dispose of that fact that Melito is here affirmed to have
“exhorted (lit., said to) Cæsar, etc.” It was clearly meant to be understood that the discourse, or speech, was
spoken: the references to writing merely show that it was written, either before or after the delivery.</note>
<note type="footnote">3549 Cureton: “passion.” The word *** takes both meanings.</note>
<note type="footnote">3550 Lit. “sojourn beneath it.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3551 Cureton: “act foolishly.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3552 Lit. “sight.”</note>

<pb n="2007"/>
<p>“If, therefore, a man forsake the light, and say that there is another God, it is plain from
what he himself says that it is some created thing which he calls God. For, if a man call fire
God, it is not God, because it is fire; and, if a man call water God, it is not God, because it
is water; and, if he so call this earth on which we tread, or these heavens which are seen by
us, or the sun, or the moon, or some one of these stars which run their course without
ceasing by Divine command, and do not speed along by their own will, neither are these
gods; and, if a man call gold and silver gods, are not these objects things which we use as we
please? and, if he so call those pieces of wood which we burn, or those stones which we break,
how can these things be gods? For, lo! they are for the use of man. How can ‘they’ escape
the commission of great sin, who in their speech change the great God into those things
which, so long as they continue, continue by Divine command?</p>
<p>“But, notwithstanding this, I say that so long as a man does not hear, and so does not
discern or understand that there is a Lord over these creatures, he is not perhaps to be
blamed: because no one finds fault with a blind man though he walk ever so badly. For, in
the same manner as the blind, so men also, when they were seeking after God, stumbled
upon stones and blocks of wood; and such of them as were rich stumbled upon gold and
silver, and were prevented by their stumblings from finding that which they were seeking
after. But, now that a voice has been heard through all the earth,3553 declaring that there is
a God of truth, and there has been given to every man an eye wherewith to see, those persons
are without excuse who are ashamed of incurring the censure of their former companions
in error, and yet desire to walk in the right way. For those who are ashamed to be saved
must of necessity perish. I therefore counsel them to open their eyes and see: for, lo! light
is given abundantly3554 to us all to see thereby; and if, when light has arisen upon us, any
one close his eyes so as not to see, into the ditch he must go.3555 But why is a man ashamed
of the censure of those who have been in error along with himself? Rather does it behove
him to persuade them to follow in his steps; and, if they should not be persuaded by him,
then to disengage himself from their society. For there are some men who are unable to
rise from their mother earth, and therefore also do they make them gods from the earth
their mother; and they are condemned by the judgments of truth, forasmuch as they apply
the name of Him who is unchangeable to those objects which are subject to change, and
shrink not from calling those things gods which have been made by the hands of man, and
dare to make an image of God whom they have not seen.</p>

<p>“But I have to remark further, that the Sibyl3556 also has said concerning them that it
is the images of deceased kings that they worship. And this is easy to understand: for, lo!
even now they worship and honour the images of those of Cæsarean rank3557 more than
their former gods; for from those their former gods both pecuniary tribute and produce accrue
to Cæsar, as to one who is greater than they. On this account, those who despise them, and
so cause Cæsar’s revenue to fall short, are put to death. But to the treasury of other kings
also it is appointed how much the worshippers in various places shall pay, and how many
vesselfuls3558 of water from the sea they shall supply. Such is the wickedness of the world—of
those who worship and fear that which has no sensation. Many of them, too, who are crafty,
either for the sake of gain, or for vainglory, or for dominion over the multitude, both
themselves worship, and incite those who are destitute of understanding to worship, that
which has no sensation.</p>
<p>“I will further write and show, as far as my ability goes, how and for what causes images
were made to kings and tyrants, and how they came to be regarded3559 as gods. The people
of Argos made images to Hercules, because he belonged to their city, and was strong, and
by his valour slew noxious beasts, and more especially because they were afraid of him. For
he was subject to no control, and carried off the wives of many: for his lust was great, like
that of Zuradi the Persian, his friend. Again, the people of Acte worshipped Dionysus,3560
a king, because he had recently3561 planted the vine in their country. The Egyptians worshipped
Joseph the Hebrew, who was called Serapis, because he supplied them with corn
during the years of famine. The Athenians worshipped Athene, the daughter of Zeus, king
of the island of Crete, because she built the town of Athens, and made Ericthippus her son
king there, whom she had by adultery with Hephæstus, a blacksmith, son of a wife of her
father. She was, too, always courting the society of Hercules, because he was her brother
on her father’s side. For Zeus the king became enamoured of Alcmene, the wife of Electryon,
who was from Argos, and committed adultery with her, and she gave birth to Hercules.
The people of Phoenicia worshipped Balthi,3562 queen of Cyprus, because she fell in love
<note type="footnote">3556 See vol. i. p. 280, this series, where the following lines are quoted by Justin Martyr from the Sibylline

with Tamuz, son of Cuthar king of the Phoenicians, and left her own kingdom and came
and dwelt in Gebal, a fortress of the Phoenicians, and at the same time made all the Cyprians
subject to King Cuthar. Also, before Tamuz she had fallen in love with Ares, and committed
adultery with him; and Hephæstus, her husband, caught her, and his jealousy was roused
against her, and he came and killed Tamuz in Mount Lebanon, as he was hunting3563 wild
boars; and from that time Balthi remained in Gebal, and she died in the city of Aphiki,3564
where Tamuz was buried. The Elamites worshipped Nuh, daughter of the king of Elam:
when the enemy had carried her captive, her father made for her an image and a temple in
Shushan, a royal residence which is in Elam. The Syrians worshipped Athi, a Hadibite, who
sent the daughter of Belat, a person skilled in medicine, and she healed Simi, the daughter
of Hadad king of Syria; and some time afterwards, when Hadad himself had the leprosy
upon him, Athi entreated Elisha the Hebrew, and he came and healed him of his leprosy.
The people of Mesopotamia also worshipped Cuthbi, a Hebrew woman, because she delivered
Bakru, the paternal king3565 of Edessa, from his enemies. With respect to Nebo, who is
worshipped in Mabug, why should I write to you? For, lo! all the priests who are in Mabug
know that it is the image of Orpheus, a Thracian Magus. Hadran, again, is the image of
Zaradusht, a Persian Magus. For both of these Magi practised magic at a well which was in
a wood in Mabug, in which was an unclean spirit, and it assaulted and disputed the passage
of every one who passed by in all that country in which the town of Mabug is situated; and
these Magi, in accordance with what was a mystery in their Magian system, bade Simi, the
daughter of Hadad, to draw water from the sea and pour it into the well, so that the spirit
should not come up and commit assault. In like manner, the rest of mankind made images
to their kings and worshipped them; of which matter I will not write further.</p>
<p>“But thou, a person of liberal mind, and familiar with the truth, if thou wilt properly

to the dialect of Edessa. A similar use of the same adjective is quoted from Buxtorf, Lex. Chald. Talm.,
p. 12: “ אַבַּיי cognomen R. Nachmanis, qui a celebritate familiæ sic cognominatus est, quasi Patritius.” This

esteemed by thee just as they are—images as images, and sculptures as sculptures; and let
not that which is only made be put by thee in the place of Him who is not made, but let
Him, the ever-living God, be constantly present to thy mind.3568 For thy mind itself is His
likeness: for it too is invisible and impalpable,3569 and not to be represented by any form,
yet by its will is the whole bodily frame moved. Know, therefore, that, if thou constantly
serve Him who is immoveable, even He exists for ever, so thou also, when thou shalt have
put off this body, which is visible and corruptible, shall stand before Him for ever, endowed
with life and knowledge, and thy works shall be to thee wealth inexhaustible and possessions

That which is not fashioned, nor made, nor represented by art: that is, which has never

and honour, and move their riches about from place to place, and then worship them. And
what infamy can be greater than this, that a man should worship his riches, and forsake
Him who bestowed those riches upon him? and that he should revile man, yet worship the
image of man; and slay a beast, yet worship the likeness of a beast? This also is evident, that
it is the workmanship of their fellowmen that they worship: for they do not worship the

set before thee the multitude of waters, and restrained them by His word; He has set before
thee the wide earth, which remains at rest, and continues before thee without variation:3573
yet, lest thou shouldst suppose that of its own nature it so continues, He makes it also to
quake when He pleaseth; He has set before thee the clouds, which by His command bring
water from above and satisfy the earth—that from hence thou mayest understand that He
who puts these things in motion is superior to them all, and mayest accept thankfully the
goodness of Him who has given thee a mind whereby to distinguish these things from one
another.</p>
<p>“Wherefore I counsel thee to know thyself, and to know God. For understand how that
there is within thee that which is called the soul—by it the eye seeth, by it the ear heareth,
by it the mouth speaketh; and how it makes use of the whole body; and how, whenever He
pleaseth to remove the soul from the body, this falleth to decay and perisheth. From this,
therefore, which exists within thyself and is invisible, understand how God also moveth the
whole by His power, like the body; and that, whenever it pleases Him to withdraw His power,
the whole world also, like the body, will fall to decay and perish.</p>
<p>“But why this world was made, and why it passes away, and why the body exists, and
why it falls to decay, and why it continues, thou canst not know until thou hast raised thy
head from this sleep in which thou art sunk, and hast opened thine eyes and seen that God

is One, the Lord of all, and hast come to serve Him with all thy heart. Then will He grant
thee to know His will: for every one that is severed from the knowledge of the living God
is dead and buried even while in his body. Therefore is it that thou dost wallow on the
ground before demons and shadows, and askest vain petitions from that which has not
anything to give. But thou, stand thou up from among those who are lying on the earth
and caressing stones, and giving their substance as food for the fire, and offering their
raiment to idols, and, while themselves possessed of senses, are bent on serving that which
has no sensation; and offer thou for thy imperishable soul petitions for that which decayeth
not, to God who suffers no decay—and thy freedom will be at once apparent; and be thou
careful of it,3574 and give thanks to God who made thee, and gave thee the mind of the free,
that thou mightest shape thy conduct even as thou wilt. He hath set before thee all these
things, and showeth thee that, if thou follow after evil, thou shalt be condemned for thy evil
deeds; but that, if after goodness, thou shalt receive from Him abundant good,3575 together
with immortal life for ever.</p>
<p>“There is, therefore, nothing to hinder thee from changing thy evil manner of life, because
thou art a free man; or from seeking and finding out who is the Lord of all; or from serving
Him with all thy heart: because with Him there is no reluctance to give the knowledge of
Himself to those that seek it, according to the measure of their capacity to know Him.</p>
<p>“Let it be thy first care not to deceive thyself. For, if thou sayest of that which is not
God: This is God, thou deceivest thyself, and sinnest before the God of truth. Thou fool!
is that God which is bought and sold? Is that God which is in want? Is that God which must
be watched over? How buyest thou him as a slave, and servest him as a master? How askest
thou of him, as of one that is rich, to give to thee, and thyself givest to him as to one that is
poor? How dost thou expect of him that he will make thee victorious in battle? for, lo! when
thy enemies have conquered thee, they strip him likewise.</p>
<p>“Perhaps one who is a king may say: I cannot behave myself aright, because I am a king;
it becomes me to do the will of the many. He who speaks thus really deserves to be laughed
at: for why should not the king himself lead the way3576 to all good things, and persuade
the people under his rule to behave with purity, and to know God in truth, and in his own
person set before them the patterns of all things excellent—since thus it becomes him to
do? For it is a shameful thing that a king, however badly he may conduct himself, should
yet judge and condemn those who do amiss.</p>
<p>“My opinion is this: that in ‘this’ way a kingdom may be governed in peace—when the
sovereign is acquainted with the God of truth, and is withheld by fear of Him from doing

wrong3577 to those who are his subjects, and judges everything with equity, as one who
knows that he himself also will be judged before God; while, at the same time, those who
are under his rule3578 are withheld by the fear of God from doing wrong to their sovereign,
and are restrained by the same fear from doing wrong to one another. By this knowledge
of God and fear of Him all evil may be removed from the realm. For, if the sovereign abstain
from doing wrong to those who are under his rule, and they abstain from doing wrong to
him and to each other, it is evident that the whole country will dwell in peace. Many blessings,
too, will be enjoyed there, because amongst them all the name of God will be glorified.
For what blessing is greater than this, that a sovereign should deliver the people that are
under his rule from error, and by this good deed render himself pleasing to God? For from
error arise all those evils from which kingdoms suffer; but the greatest of all errors is this:
when a man is ignorant of God, and in God’s stead worships that which is not God.</p>
<p>“There are, however, persons who say: It is for the honour of God that we make the
image: in order, that is, that we may worship the God who is concealed from our view. But
they are unaware that God is in every country, and in every place, and is never absent, and
that there is not anything done and He knoweth it not. Yet thou, despicable man! within
whom He is, and without whom He is, and above whom He is, hast nevertheless gone and
bought thee wood from the carpenter’s, and it is carved and made into an image insulting
to God.3579 To this thou offerest sacrifice, and knowest not that the all-seeing eye seeth
thee, and that the word of truth reproves thee, and says to thee: How can the unseen God
be sculptured? Nay, it is the likeness of thyself that thou makest and worshippest. Because
the wood has been sculptured, hast thou not the insight to perceive that it is still wood, or
that the stone is still stone? The gold also the workman3580 taketh according to its weight
in the balance. And when thou hast had it made3581 into an image, why dost thou weigh
it? Therefore thou art a lover of gold, and not a lover of God. And art thou not ashamed,
perchance it be deficient, to demand of the maker of it why he has stolen some of it? Though
thou hast eyes, dose thou not see? And though thou hast intelligence,3582 dose thou not

<p>“Again, there are persons who say: Whatsoever our fathers have bequeathed to us, that
we reverence. Therefore, of course, it is, that those whose fathers have bequeathed them
poverty strive to become rich! and those whose fathers did not instruct them, desire to be
instructed, and to learn that which their fathers knew not! And why, forsooth, do the children
of the blind see, and the children of the lame walk? Nay, it is not well for a man to follow
his predecessors, if they be those whose course was evil; but rather that we should turn from
that path of theirs, lest that which befell our predecessors should bring disaster upon us
also. Wherefore, inquire whether thy father’s course was good: and, if so, do thou also follow
in his steps; but, if thy father’s course was very evil, let thine be good, and so let it be with
thy children after thee.3584 Be grieved also for thy father because his course is evil, so long
as thy grief may avail to help him. But, as for thy children, speak to them thus: There is a
God, the Father of all, who never came into being, neither was ever made, and by whose
will all things subsist. He also made the luminaries, that His works may see one another;
and He conceals Himself in His power from all His works: for it is not permitted to any
being subject to change to see Him who changes not. But such as are mindful of His words,
and are admitted into that covenant which is unchangeable, ‘they’ see God—so far as it is
possible for them to see Him. These also will have power to escape destruction, when the
flood of fire comes upon all the world. For there was once a flood and a wind,3585 and the
great3586 men were swept away by a violent blast from the north, but the just were left, for
a demonstration of the truth. Again, at another time there was a flood of water, and all men
and animals perished in the multitude of waters, but the just were preserved in an ark of
wood by the command of God. So also will it be at the last time: there shall be a flood of

And then shall those who have not known God, and those who have made them idols, bemoan
themselves, when they shall see those idols of theirs being burnt up, together with

not away, and thou wilt deliver thy soul, and the souls of thy children also, from that which

<p>For this reason did the Father send His Son from heaven without a bodily form, that,
when He should put on a body by means of the Virgin’s womb, and be born man, He might
save man, and gather together those members of His which death had scattered when he
divided man.</p>
<p>And further on:—The earth shook, and its foundations trembled; the sun fled away, and
the elements turned back, and the day was changed into night: for they could not endure
the sight of their Lord hanging on a tree. The whole creation was amazed, marvelling and
saying, “What new mystery, then, is this? The Judge is judged, and holds his peace; the Invisible
One is seen, and is not ashamed; the Incomprehensible is laid hold upon, and is not
indignant; the Illimitable is circumscribed, and doth not resist; the Impossible suffereth,
and doth not avenge; the Immortal dieth, and answereth not a word; the Celestial is laid in
the grave, and endureth! What new mystery is this?” The whole creation, I say, was astonished;
but, when our Lord arose from the place of the dead, and trampled death under foot,
and bound the strong one, and set man free, then did the whole creation see clearly that for
man’s sake the Judge was condemned, and the Invisible was seen, and the Illimitable was
circumscribed, and the Impassible suffered, and the Immortal died, and the Celestial was
laid in the gave. For our Lord, when He was born man, was condemned in order that He
might show mercy, was bound in order that He might loose, was seized in order that He

who rose from the place of the dead, and raised up the race of Adam from the grave below,
This is He who was put to death. And where was He put to death? In the midst of Jerusalem.
By whom? By Israel: because He cured their lame, and cleansed their lepers, and gave light
to their blind, and raised their dead! This was the cause of His death. Thou, O Israel, wast
giving commands, and He was being crucified; thou wast rejoicing, and He was being buried;
thou wast reclining on a soft couch, and He was watching in the grave and the shroud.3599
O Israel, transgressor of the law, why hast thou committed this new iniquity, subjecting the
Lord to new sufferings—thine own Lord, Him who fashioned thee, Him who made thee,
Him who honoured thee, who called thee Israel? But thou hast not been found to be Israel:
for thou hast not seen God, nor understood the Lord. Thou hast not known, O Israel, that
this was the first-born of God, who was begotten before the sun, who made the light to shine
forth, who lighted up the day, who separated the darkness, who fixed the first foundations,
who poised the earth, who collected the ocean, who stretched out the firmament, who adorned
the world. Bitter were thy nails, and sharp; bitter thy tongue, which thou didst whet;
bitter was Judas, to whom thou gavest hire; bitter thy false witnesses, whom thou stirredst
up; bitter thy gall, which thou preparedst; bitter thy vinegar, which thou madest; bitter thy
hands, filled with blood. Thou slewest thy Lord, and He was lifted up upon the tree; and
an inscription was fixed above, to show who He was that was slain. And who was this? (that

nevertheless hearken, and tremble.) It was He because of whom the earth quaked. He that
hung up the earth in space was Himself hanged up; He that fixed the heavens was fixed with

From the Apology Addressed to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.3608</head>
<p>For the race of the pious is now persecuted in a way contrary to all precedent, being
harassed by a new kind of edicts3609 everywhere in Asia. For unblushing informers, and
such as are greedy of other men’s goods, taking occasion from the orders issued, carry on
their robbery without any disguise, plundering of their property night and day those who
are guilty of no wrong.</p>
<p>If these proceedings take place at thy bidding,3610 well and good.3611 For a just sovereign
will never take unjust measures; and we, on our part, gladly accept the honour of such a
death. This request only we present to thee, that thou wouldst first of all examine for thyself
into the behaviour of these reputed agents of so much strife, and then come to a just decision
as to whether they merit death and punishment, or deserve to live in safety and quiet. But
if, on the contrary, it shall turn out that this measure, and this new sort of command, which
it would be unbecoming to employ even against barbarian foemen, do not proceed from
thee, then all the more do we entreat thee not to leave us thus exposed to the spoliation of
the populace.</p>
<p>For the philosophy current with us flourished in the first instance among barbarians;3612
and, when it afterwards sprang up among the nations under thy rule, during the distinguished
reign of thy ancestor Augustus, it proved to be a blessing of most happy omen to thy empire.
For from that time the Roman power has risen to greatness and splendour. To this power
thou hast succeeded as the much desired3613 possessor; and such shalt thou continue, together
with thy son,3614 if thou protect that philosophy which has grown up with thy empire,
and which took its rise with Augustus; to which also thy more recent ancestors paid honour,
along with the other religions prevailing in the empire. A very strong proof, moreover, that

of such happy commencement was established, is this—that ever since the reign of Augustus
nothing untoward has happened; but, on the contrary, everything has contributed to the
splendour and renown of the empire, in accordance with the devout wishes3615 of all. Nero
and Domitian alone of all the emperors, imposed upon by certain calumniators, have cared
to bring any impeachment against our doctrines. They, too, are the source from which it
has happened that the lying slanders on those who profess them have, in consequence of
the senseless habit which prevails of taking things on hearsay, flowed down to our own
times.3616 But the course which they in their ignorance pursued was set aside by thy pious
progenitors, who frequently and in many instances rebuked by their rescripts3617 those who
dared to set on foot any hostilities against them. It appears, for example, that thy grandfather
Adrian wrote, among others, to Fundanus, the proconsul then in charge of the government
of Asia. Thy father, too, when thou thyself wast associated with him3618 in the administration
of the empire, wrote to the cities, forbidding them to take any measures adverse to us:
among the rest to the people of Larissa, and of Thessalonica, and of Athens, and, in short,
to all the Greeks. And as regards thyself, seeing that thy sentiments respecting the Christians3619
are not only the same as theirs, but even much more generous and wise, we are the
more persuaded that thou wilt do all that we ask of thee.</p>

From the Book of Extracts.3622</head>
<p>Melito to his brother Onesimus, greeting:—</p>
<p>As you have often, prompted by your regard for the word of God, expressed a wish to
have some extracts made from the Law and the Prophets concerning the Saviour, and concerning
our faith in general, and have desired, moreover, to obtain an accurate account of
the Ancient Books, as regards their number and their arrangement, I have striven to the
best of my ability to perform this task: well knowing your zeal for the faith, and your
eagerness to become acquainted with the Word, and especially because I am assured that,
through your yearning after God, you esteem these things beyond all things else, engaged
as you are in a struggle for eternal salvation.</p>
<p>I accordingly proceeded to the East, and went to the very spot where the things in
question were preached and took place; and, having made myself accurately acquainted with
the books of the Old Testament, I have set them down below, and herewith send you the
list. Their names are as follows:—</p>
<p>The five books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;
Joshua,3623 Judges, Ruth, the four books of Kings, the two of Chronicles, the book of the
Psalms of David, the Proverbs of Solomon, also called the Book of Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, the
Song of Songs, Job, the books of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, of the twelve contained in a
single book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras. From these I have made my extracts, dividing them
into six books.</p>

From the Catena on Genesis.3624</head>
<p>In place of Isaac the just, a ram appeared for slaughter, in order that Isaac might be
liberated from his bonds. The slaughter of this animal redeemed Isaac from death. In like
manner, the Lord, being slain, saved us; being bound, He loosed us; being sacrificed, He
redeemed us…</p>
<p>For the Lord was a lamb, like the ram which Abraham saw caught in the bush Sabec.3625
But this bush represented the cross, and that place Jerusalem, and the lamb the Lord bound
for slaughter.</p>
<p>For as a ram was He bound, says he concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and as a lamb
was He shorn, and as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb was He crucified;
and He carried the cross3626 on His shoulders when He was led up to the hill to be slain, as
was Isaac by his father. But Christ suffered, and Isaac did not suffer: for he was but a type
of Him who should suffer. Yet, even when serving only for a type of Christ, he smote men
with astonishment and fear.</p>
<p>For a new mystery was presented to view,—a son led by his father to a mountain to be
slain, whose feet he bound together, and laid him on the wood of the sacrifice, preparing
with care3627 whatever was necessary to his immolation. Isaac on his part is silent, bound
like a ram, not opening his mouth, nor uttering a sound with his voice. For, not fearing the
knife, nor quailing before the fire, nor troubled by the prospect of suffering, he sustained
bravely the character of the type of the Lord. Accordingly there lies Isaac before us, with
his feet bound like a ram, his father standing by, with the knife all bare in his hand, not
shrinking from shedding the blood of his son.</p>

<p>On the Nature of Christ.3635</p>
<p>For there is no need, to persons of intelligence, to attempt to prove, from the deeds of
Christ subsequent to His baptism, that His soul and His body, His human nature3636 like
ours, were real, and no phantom of the imagination. For the deeds done by Christ after His
baptism, and especially His miracles, gave indication and assurance to the world of the Deity
hidden in His flesh. For, being at once both God and perfect man likewise, He gave us sure
indications of His two natures:3637 of His Deity, by His miracles during the three years that
elapsed after His baptism; of His humanity, during the thirty similar periods which preceded
His baptism, in which, by reason of His low estate3638 as regards the flesh, He concealed
the signs of His Deity, although He was the true God existing before all ages.</p>

<p>The descent of the Lord—His visitation of men. As in Micah: “Behold, the Lord shall
come forth from His place; He shall come down trampling under foot the ends of the
earth.”3668 Likewise in a bad sense. In Genesis: “The Lord came down to see the tower.”3669</p>
<p>The ascent of the Lord—the raising up of man, who is taken from earth to heaven. In
the Psalm: “Who ascendeth above the heaven of heavens to the east.”3670</p>
<p>The standing of the Lord—the patience of the Deity, by which He bears with sinners
that they may come to repentance. As in Habakkuk: “He stood and measured the earth;3671

<p>The transition of the Lord—His assumption of our flesh, through which by His birth,
His death, His resurrection, His ascent into heaven, He made transitions, so to say. In the
Song of Songs: “Behold, He cometh, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the
hills.”3673</p>
<p>The going3674 of the Lord—His coming or visitation. In the Psalm.</p>
<p>The way of the Lord—the operation of the Deity. As in Job, in speaking of the devil:
“He is the beginning of the ways of the Lord.”3675</p>
<p>Again: The ways of the Lord—His precepts. In Hosea: “For the ways of the Lord are
straight, and the just shall walk in them.”3676</p>
<p>The footsteps of the Lord—the signs of His secret operations. As in the Psalm: “And
Thy footsteps shall not be known.”3677</p>
<p>The knowledge of the Lord—that which makes men to know Him. To Abraham He
says: “Now I know that thou fearest the Lord;”3678 that is, I have made thee to know.</p>

<p>The remembrance of God—His mercy, by which He rejects and has mercy on whom He
will. So in Genesis: “The Lord remembered Noah;”3681 and in another passage: “The Lord
hath remembered His people.”3682</p>
<p>The repentance of the Lord—His change of procedure.3683 As in the book of Kings: “It
repented me that I have made Saul king.”3684</p>
<p>The anger and wrath of the Lord—the vengeance of the Deity upon sinners, when He
bears with them with a view to punishment, does not at once judge them according to strict
equity. As in the Psalm: “In His anger and in His wrath will He trouble them.”3685</p>
<p>The sleeping of the Lord—when, in the thoughts of some, His faithfulness is not sufficiently
wakeful. In the Psalm: “Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord?”3686
The watches of the Lord—in the guardianship of His elect He is always at hand by the
presence of His Deity. In the Psalm: “Lo! He will not slumber nor sleep.”3687</p>
<p>The sitting of the Lord—His ruling. In the Psalm: “The Lord sitteth upon His holy
seat.”3688</p>
<p>The footstool of the Lord—man assumed by the Word; or His saints, as some think. In
the Psalm: “Worship ye His footstool, for it is holy.”</p>

<head>Hegesippus.3691</head>
<p><del>a.d. 170.</del> One of the sub-Apostolic age, a contemporary of Justin and of the martyrs
of “the good Aurelius,” we must yet distinguish Hegesippus3692 from the apologists. He is
the earliest of the Church’s chroniclers—we can hardly call him a historian. His aims were
noble and his character was pure; nor can we refuse him the credit due to a foresight of the
Church’s ultimate want of historical material, which he endeavoured to supply.</p>
<p>What is commonly regarded as his defect is in reality one of his greatest merits as a
witness: he was a Hebrew, and looks at the Church from the stand-point of “James the
Lord’s brother.” When we observe his Catholic spirit, therefore, as well as his Catholic orthodoxy;
his sympathy with the Gentile Church and Pauline faith of the Corinthians; his
abhorrence of “the Circumcision” so far as it bred sects and heresies against Christ; and
when we find him confirming the testimony of the Apostolic Fathers, and sustaining the
traditions of Antioch by those of Jerusalem,—we have double reason to cherish his name,
and to treasure up “the fragments that remain” of his works. That touching episode of the
kindred of Christ, as they appeared before Domitian, has always impressed my imagination
as worthy to be classed with the story of St. John and the robber, as one of the most suggestive
incidents of early Christian history. We must lament the loss of other portions of the
Memoirs which were known to exist in the seventeenth century. He was a traveller, and
must have seen much of the Apostolic churches in the East and West; and the mere scraps
we have of his narrative concerning Corinth and Rome excite a natural curiosity as to the
rest, which may lead to gratifying discoveries.</p>

<head>Fragments from His Five Books of Commentaries on the Acts of the Church.</head>
<head>I.
Concerning the Martyrdom of James, the Brother of the Lord, from Book V.3693</head>
<p>James, the Lord’s brother, succeeds to the government of the Church, in conjunction
with the apostles. He has been universally called the Just, from the days of the Lord down
to the present time. For many bore the name of James; but this one was holy from his
mother’s womb. He drank no wine or other intoxicating liquor,3694 nor did he eat flesh;
no razor came upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil, nor make use of the bath.
He alone was permitted to enter the holy place:3695 for he did not wear any woollen garment,
but fine linen only. He alone, I say, was wont to go into the temple: and he used to be found
kneeling on his knees, begging forgiveness for the people—so that the skin of his knees became
horny like that of a camel’s, by reason of his constantly bending the knee in adoration
to God, and begging forgiveness for the people. Therefore, in consequence of his pre-eminent
justice, he was called the Just, and Oblias,3696 which signifies in Greek Defence of the People,
and Justice, in accordance with what the prophets declare concerning him.</p>
<p>Now some persons belonging to the seven sects existing among the people, which have
been before described by me in the Notes, asked him: “What is the door of Jesus?” And he
replied that He was the Saviour. In consequence of this answer, some believed that Jesus is
the Christ. But the sects before mentioned did not believe, either in a resurrection or in the
coming of One to requite every man according to his works; but those who did believe, believed
because of James. So, when many even of the ruling class believed, there was a commotion
among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees, who said: “A little more, and we shall
have all the people looking for Jesus as the Christ.</p>
<p>They came, therefore, in a body to James, and said: “We entreat thee, restrain the people:
for they are gone astray in their opinions about Jesus, as if he were the Christ. We entreat
thee to persuade all who have come hither for the day of the passover, concerning Jesus.
For we all listen to thy persuasion; since we, as well as all the people, bear thee testimony

name to a fortified ridge of Mount Zion. See 2 Chron. xxvii. 3. It has been proposed to read ἐκαλεῖτο Σαδδὶκ
καὶ ᾽Ωζλιὰμ, ὅ ἐστιν δίκαιος καὶ περιοχὴ τοῦ λαοῦ. The text, in which not only a Hebrew word but also a Greek
(Δίκαιος) is explained in Greek, can hardly give the correct reading. [The translator suggests ᾽Ωβλίας as the
probable reading of the LXX., though it is corrupted as above.]</note>

<pb n="2037"/>
that thou art just, and showest partiality to none. Do thou, therefore, persuade the people
not to entertain erroneous opinions concerning Jesus: for all the people, and we also, listen
to thy persuasion. Take thy stand, then, upon the summit3697 of the temple, that from that
elevated spot thou mayest be clearly seen, and thy words may be plainly audible to all the
people. For, in order to attend the passover, all the tribes have congregated hither, and some
of the Gentiles also.”</p>
<p>The aforesaid scribes and Pharisees accordingly set James on the summit of the temple,
and cried aloud to him, and said: “O just one, whom we are all bound to obey, forasmuch
as the people is in error, and follows Jesus the crucified, do thou tell us what is the door of
Jesus, the crucified.” And he answered with a loud voice: “Why ask ye me concerning Jesus
the Son of man? He Himself sitteth in heaven, at the right hand of the Great Power, and
shall come on the clouds of heaven.”</p>
<p>And, when many were fully convinced by these words, and offered praise for the testimony
of James, and said, “Hosanna to the son of David,” then again the said Pharisees and
scribes said to one another, “We have not done well in procuring this testimony to Jesus.
But let us go up and throw him down, that they may be afraid, and not believe him.” And
they cried aloud, and said: “Oh! oh! the just man himself is in error.” Thus they fulfilled
the Scripture written in Isaiah: “Let us away with the just man, because he is troublesome
to us: therefore shall they eat the fruit of their doings.” So they went up and threw down
the just man, and said to one another: “Let us stone James the Just.” And they began to
stone him: for he was not killed by the fall; but he turned, and kneeled down, and said: “I
beseech Thee, Lord God our Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>And, while they were thus stoning him to death, one of the priests, the sons of Rechab,
the son of Rechabim, to whom testimony is borne by Jeremiah the prophet, began to cry
aloud, saying: “Cease, what do ye? The just man is praying for us.” But one among them,
one of the fullers, took the staff with which he was accustomed to wring out the garments
he dyed, and hurled it at the head of the just man.</p>
<p>And so he suffered martyrdom; and they buried him on the spot, and the pillar erected
to his memory still remains, close by the temple. This man was a true witness to both Jews
and Greeks that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
<p>And shortly after Vespasian besieged Judæa, taking them captive.</p>

<p>There still survived of the kindred of the Lord the grandsons of Judas, who according
to the flesh was called his brother. These were informed against, as belonging to the family
of David, and Evocatus brought them before Domitian Cæsar: for that emperor dreaded
the advent of Christ, as Herod had done.</p>
<p>So he asked them whether they were of the family of David; and they confessed they
were. Next he asked them what property they had, or how much money they possessed.
They both replied that they had only 9000 denaria between them, each of them owning half
that sum; but even this they said they did not possess in cash, but as the estimated value of
some land, consisting of thirty-nine plethra only, out of which they had to pay the dues, and
that they supported themselves by their own labour. And then they began to hold out their
hands, exhibiting, as proof of their manual labour, the roughness of their skin, and the corns
raised on their hands by constant work.</p>
<p>Being then asked concerning Christ and His kingdom, what was its nature, and when
and where it was to appear, they returned answer that it was not of this world, nor of the
earth, but belonging to the sphere of heaven and angels, and would make its appearance at
the end of time, when He shall come in glory, and judge living and dead, and render to every
one according to the course of his life.3699</p>
<p>Thereupon Domitian passed no condemnation upon them, but treated them with contempt,
as too mean for notice, and let them go free. At the same time he issued a command,
and put a stop to the persecution against the Church.</p>
<p>When they were released they became leaders3700 of the churches, as was natural in the
case of those who were at once martyrs and of the kindred of the Lord. And, after the establishment
of peace to the Church, their lives were prolonged to the reign of Trajan.</p>

<head>Concerning the Martyrdom of Symeon the son of Clopas, Bishop of Jerusalem.3701</head>
<p>Some of these heretics, forsooth, laid an information against Symeon the son of Clopas,
as being of the family of David, and a Christian. And on these charges he suffered martyrdom
when he was 120 years old, in the reign of Trajan Cæsar, when Atticus was consular legate3702
in Syria. And it so happened, says the same writer, that, while inquiry was then being made
for those belonging to the royal tribe of the Jews, the accusers themselves were convicted
of belonging to it. With show of reason could it be said that Symeon was one of those who
actually saw and heard the Lord, on the ground of his great age, and also because the
Scripture of the Gospels makes mention of Mary the daughter of Clopas, who, as our narrative
has shown already, was his father.</p>
<p>The same historian mentions others also, of the family of one of the reputed brothers of
the Saviour, named Judas, as having survived until this same reign, after the testimony they
bore for the faith of Christ in the time of Domitian, as already recorded.</p>
<p>He writes as follows: They came, then, and took the presidency of every church, as witnesses
for Christ, and as being of the kindred of the Lord. And, after profound peace had
been established in every church, they remained down to the reign of Trajan Cæsar: that
is, until the time when he who was sprung from an uncle of the Lord, the aforementioned
Symeon son of Clopas, was informed against by the various heresies, and subjected to an
accusation like the rest, and for the same cause, before the legate Atticus; and, while suffering
outrage during many days, he bore testimony for Christ: so that all, including the legate
himself, were astonished above measure that a man 120 years old should have been able to
endure such torments. He was finally condemned to be crucified.</p>
<p>…Up to that period the Church had remained like a virgin pure and uncorrupted: for,
if there were any persons who were disposed to tamper with the wholesome rule of the
preaching of salvation,3703 they still lurked in some dark place of concealment or other.
But, when the sacred band of apostles had in various ways closed their lives, and that generation
of men to whom it had been vouchsafed to listen to the Godlike Wisdom with their
own ears had passed away, then did the confederacy of godless error take its rise through
the treachery of false teachers, who, seeing that none of the apostles any longer survived, at
length attempted with bare and uplifted head to oppose the preaching of the truth by
preaching “knowledge falsely so called.”</p>

<head>Concerning His Journey to Rome, and the Jewish Sects.3704</head>
<p>And the church of the Corinthians continued in the orthodox faith3705 up to the time
when Primus was bishop in Corinth. I had some intercourse with these brethren on my
voyage to Rome, when I spent several days with the Corinthians, during which we were
mutually refreshed by the orthodox faith.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Rome, I drew up a list of the succession of bishops down to Anicetus,
whose deacon was Eleutherus. To Anicetus succeeded Soter, and after him came Eleutherus.
But in the case of every succession,3706 and in every city, the state of affairs is in accordance
with the teaching of the Law and of the Prophets and of the Lord.…</p>
<p>And after James the Just had suffered martyrdom, as had the Lord also and on the same
account, again Symeon the son of Clopas, descended from the Lord’s uncle, is made bishop,
his election being promoted by all as being a kinsman of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore was the Church called a virgin, for she was not as yet corrupted by worthless
teaching.3707 Thebulis it was who, displeased because he was not made bishop, first began
to corrupt her by stealth. He too was connected with the seven sects which existed among
the people, like Simon, from whom come the Simoniani; and Cleobius, from whom come
the Cleobiani; and Doritheus, from whom come the Dorithiani; and Gorthæus, from whom
come the Gortheani; Masbothæus, from whom come the Masbothæi. From these men also
come the Menandrianists, and the Marcionists, and the Carpocratians, and the Valentinians,
and the Basilidians, and the Saturnilians. Each of these leaders in his own private and distinct
capacity brought in his own private opinion. From these have come false Christs, false
prophets, false apostles—men who have split up the one Church into parts3708 through
their corrupting doctrines, uttered in disparagement of God and of His Christ.…</p>
<p>There were, moreover, various opinions in the matter of circumcision among the children
of Israel, held by those who were opposed to the tribe of Judah and to Christ: such as the
Essenes, the Galileans, the Hemerobaptists, the Masbothæi, the Samaritans, the Sadducees,
the Pharisees.</p>

<head>Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 170.</del> Eusebius is almost diffuse in what he tells us of this Dionysius,3709 “who was
appointed over the church at Corinth, and imparted freely, not only to his own people, but
to others, and those abroad also, the blessings of his divine labours.” He wrote “Catholic
Epistles;” he addressed an epistle to the Spartans and the Athenians; and, as Eusebius says,
Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of St. Paul, was the first bishop of Athens.3710 He
wrote to the Nicomedians, refuting Marcion, and closely adhering to “the rule of faith.” In
an epistle to the Gortynians and others in Crete, he praises Philip for his courageous ministry,
and warns them against the heretics. He seems to recognise Palmas as bishop of Amastris
and Pontus, and adds expositions of Scripture, and rules regarding marriage, its purity and
sanctity. He also inculcates tenderness to penitent lapsers and backsliders. With Pinytus,
bishop of the Gnossians, he corresponds on similar subjects; but Pinytus, while he thanks
him and commends his clemency, evidently regards him as too much inclined to furnish
“food for babes,” and counsels him to add “strong meat for those of full age.” He also writes
to Chrysophora, his most faithful sister, imparting spiritual instruction.</p>

<head>Rhodon.3717</head>
<p><del>a.d. 180.</del> This Rhodon3718 was supposed by St. Jerome to have been the author of the
work against the Cataphrygians, ascribed to Asterius Urbanus more probably.3719 Eusebius3720
gives us the fragment from his work against Marcion, addressed to Callistion, which
is here translated. He tells us that he was a pupil of Tatian, and expresses an intention of
furnishing original solutions of Scriptural problems stated by Tatian,3721 and by that author
explained in a manner apparently unsatisfactory. He also appears to have written against
the blasphemous Apelles,3722 whose Hexaëmeron was an attempt to refute Moses; but
whether he also fulfilled his promise concerning an ᾽Επίλυσις of Tatian’s Problems (or
Questions), seems doubtful. Routh has devoted to the fragment here translated six pages
of notes,3723 which he subjoins to the Greek text (of Eusebius) and a Latin version of the
same.</p>
<p>Wherefore also they3724 disagree among themselves, maintaining as they do an opinion
which has no consistency with itself. For one of their herd, Apelles, who prides himself on
the strictness of his life,3725 and on his age, admits that there is only one first principle,3726
yet says that the prophecies have come from an opposing spirit, in which opinion he is influenced
by the responses of a soothsaying3727 maid named Philumene. But others, among
whom are Potitus and Basilicus, like Marcion3728 himself, introduce two first principles.
These men, following the Pontic wolf, and not being able to discover any more than he the
division of things, have had to recourse to rash assertion, and declared the existence of two
first principles simply and without proof. Others of them, again, drifting from bad to worse,

Syneros, as those who adopt his teaching say.…</p>
<p>For the old man Apelles entered into conversation with us, and was convicted of uttering
many false opinions. For example, he asserted that men should on no account examine into
their creed,3729 but that every one ought to continue to the last in the belief he has once
adopted. For he declared that those who had rested their hope on the Crucified One would
be saved, provided only they were found living in the practice of good works. But the most
perplexing of all the doctrines laid down by him was, as we have remarked before, what he
said concerning God: for he affirmed that there was only one first principle, precisely as
our own faith teaches.…</p>
<p>On asking him, “Where do you get proof of this? or how are you able to assert that there
is only one first principle? tell us,”—he said that the prophecies refuted themselves, because
they had uttered nothing at all that was true: for that they were discordant and false, and
self-contradictory. As to the question, “How does it appear that there is only one first
principle?” he said he could not tell, only he was impelled to that belief. On my thereupon
conjuring him to speak the truth, he solemnly declared that he was expressing his real sentiments;
and that he did not know “how” there could be one uncreated God, but that he
believed the fact. Here I burst into laughter and rebuked him, because he professed to be a
teacher, and yet was unable to confirm by arguments what he taught.</p>

<head>Maximus, Bishop of Jerusalem.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 185–196.</del> He was a noted character among Christians, according to Eusebius;
living, according to Jerome, under Commodus and Severus. He wrote on the inveterate
question concerning the Origin of Evil; and the fragment here translated, as given by Eusebius,
is also textually cited by Origen against the Marcionites,3730 if that Dialogue be his.
The reader will not fail to recollect that liberal citations out of this work are also to be found
in Methodius, On Free-Will.3731 But all who desire fuller information on the subject will
be gratified by the learned prolegomena and notes of Routh, to which I refer them.3732
Whether Maximus was the bishop of Jerusalem (a.d. 185) mentioned by Eusebius as
presiding in that See in the sixth year of Commodus, seems to be uncertain.</p>
<p>From the Book Concerning Matter, or in Defence of the Proposition that Matter is
Created, and is Not the Cause of Evil.3733</p>
<p>“That there cannot exist two uncreated substances at one and the same time, I presume
that you hold equally with myself. You appear, however, very decidedly to have assumed,
and to have introduced into the argument, this principle, that we must of unavoidable necessity
maintain one of two things: either that God is separate from matter; or else, on the
contrary, that He is indissolubly connected with it.</p>
<p>“If, then, any one should choose to assert that He exists in union with matter, that would
be saying that there is only one uncreated substance. For either of the two must constitute
a part of the other; and, since they form parts of each other, they cannot be two uncreated
substances. Just as, in speaking of man, we do not describe him as subdivided into a number
of distinct parts, each forming a separate created substance, but, as reason requires us to do,
assert that he was made by God a single created substance consisting of many parts,—so, in
like manner, if God is not separate from matter, we are driven to the conclusion that there
is only one uncreated substance.</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, it be affirmed that He is separate from matter, it necessarily follows
that there is some other substance intermediate between the two, by which their separation
is made apparent. For it is impossible that one thing should be shown to be severed by an
interval from another, unless there be something else by which the interval between the two
is produced. This principle, too, holds good not only with regard to this or any other single

case, but in any number of cases you please. For the same argument which we have employed
in dealing with the two uncreated substances must in like manner be valid if the substances
in question be given as three. For in regard to these also I should have to inquire whether
they are separate from one another, or whether, on the contrary, each of them is united to
its fellow. For, if you should say that they are united, you would hear from me the same
argument as before; but if, on the contrary, you should say that they are separate, you could
not escape the unavoidable assumption of a separating medium.</p>
<p>“If, again, perchance any one should think that there is a third view which may be consistently
maintained with regard to uncreated substances,—namely, that God is not separate
from matter, nor yet, on the other hand, united to it as a part, but that God exists in matter
as in a place, or possibly matter exists in God,—let such a person observe the consequence:—</p>
<p>“That, if we make matter God’s place, we must of necessity admit that He can be contained,
3734 and that He is circumscribed by matter. Nay, further, he must grant that He is,
in the same way as matter, driven about hither and thither, unable to maintain His place
and to stay where He is, since that in which He exists is perpetually being driven about in
one direction or another. Beside this, he must also admit that God has had His place among
the worst kind of elements. For if matter was once in disorder, and if he reduced it to order
for the purpose of rendering it better, there was a time when God existed among the disordered
elements of matter.</p>
<p>“I might also fairly put this question: whether God filled the whole of matter, or was
in some part of it. If any one should choose to say that God was in some part of matter, he
would be making Him indefinitely smaller than matter, inasmuch as a part of it contained
the whole of Him;3735 but, if he maintained that He pervaded the whole of matter, I need
to be informed how He became the Fashioner of this matter. For we must necessarily assume,
either that there was on the part of God a contraction,3736 so to speak, of Himself, and a
withdrawal from matter, whereupon He proceeded to fashion that from which He had retired;
or else that He fashioned Himself in conjunction with matter, in consequence of having no
place to retire to.</p>
<p>“But suppose it to be maintained, on the other hand, that matter is in God, it will behove
us similarly to inquire, whether we are to understand by this that He is sundered from
Himself, and that, just like the air, which contains various kinds of animals, so is He sundered

and divided into parts for the reception of those creatures which from time to time exist
in3737 Him; or whether matter is in God as in a place,—for instance, as water is contained
in earth. For should we say ‘as in air,’ we should perforce be speaking of God as divisible
into parts; but if ‘as water in earth,’ and if matter was, as is admitted, in confusion and disorder,
and moreover also contained what was evil, we should have to admit that God is the
place of disorder and evil. But this it does not seem to me consistent with reverence to say,
but hazardous rather. For you contend that matter is uncreated,3738 that you may not have
to admit that God is the author of evil; and yet, while aiming to escape this difficulty, you
make Him the receptacle of evil.</p>
<p>“If you had stated that your suspicion that matter was uncreated arose from the nature
of created things as we find them,3739 I should have employed abundant argument in proof
that it cannot be so. But, since you have spoken of the existence of evil as the cause of such
suspicion, I am disposed to enter upon a separate examination of this point. For, when once
it has been made clear how it is that evil exists, and when it is seen to be impossible to deny
that God is the author of evil, in consequence of His having had recourse to matter for His
materials,3740 it seems to me that a suspicion of this kind disappears.</p>
<p>“You assert, then, that matter, destitute of all qualities good or bad, co-existed at the
outset with God, and that out of it He fashioned the world as we now find it.”</p>
<p>“Such is my opinion.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, if matter was without any qualities, and the world has come into existence
from God, and if the world possesses qualities, the author of those qualities must be God.”</p>
<p>“Exactly so.”</p>
<p>“Since, too, I heard you say yourself just now that out of nothing3741 nothing can possibly
come, give me an answer to the question I am about to ask you. You seem to me to think
that the qualities of the world have not sprung from pre-existing3742 qualities, and moreover
that they are something different from the substances themselves.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“If, therefore, God did not produce the qualities in question from qualities already existing,
nor yet from substances, by reason that they are not substances, the conclusion is inevitable,
that they were made by God out of nothing. So that you seemed to me to affirm more

the opinion3743 that anything was made by God out of nothing.</p>
<p>“But let us put the matter thus. We see persons among ourselves making certain things
out of nothing, however true it may be that they make them by means of something.3744
Let us take our illustration, say, from builders. These men do not make cities out of cities;
nor, similarly, temples out of temples. Nay, if you suppose that, because the substances necessary
for these constructions are already provided, therefore they make them out of that
which already exists, your reasoning is fallacious. For it is not the substance that makes the
city or the temples, but the art which is employed about the substance. Neither, again, does
the art proceed from any art inhering in the substances, but it arises independently of any
such art in them.</p>
<p>“But I fancy you will meet the argument by saying that the artist produces the art which
is manifest in the substance he has fashioned out of the art which he himself already has. In
reply to this, however, I think it may be fairly said, that neither in man does art spring from
any already existing art. For we cannot possibly allow that art exists by itself, since it belongs
to the class of things which are accidentals, and which receive their existence only when
they appear in connection with substance. For man will exist though there should be no
architecture, but the latter will have no existence unless there be first of all man. Thus we
cannot avoid the conclusion, that it is the nature of art to spring up in man out of nothing.
If, then, we have shown that this is the case with man, we surely must allow that God can
make not only the qualities of substances out of nothing, but also the substances themselves.
For, if it appears possible that anything whatever can be made out of nothing, it is proved
that this may be the case with substances also.</p>
<p>“But, since you are specially desirous of inquiring about the origin of evil, I will proceed
to the discussion of this topic. And I should like to ask you a few questions. Is it your
opinion that things evil are substances, or that they are qualities of substances?”</p>
<p>“Qualities of substances, I am disposed to say.”</p>
<p>“But matter was destitute of qualities and of form: this I assumed at the outset of the
discussion. Therefore, if things evil are qualities of substances, and matter was destitute of
qualities, and you have called God the author of qualities, God will also be the former of

that which is evil. Since, then, it is not possible, on this supposition any more than on the
other, to speak of God as not the cause of evil, it seems to me superfluous to add matter to
Him, as if that were the cause of evil. If you have any reply to make to this, begin your argument.”</p>
<p>“If, indeed, our discussion had arisen from a love of contention, I should not be willing
to have the inquiry raised a second time about the origin of evil; but, since we are prompted
rather by friendship and the good of our neighbour to engage in controversy, I readily
consent to have the question raised afresh on this subject. You have no doubt long been
aware of the character of my mind, and of the object at which I aim in dispute: that I have
no wish to vanquish falsehood by plausible reasoning, but rather that truth should be established
in connection with thorough investigation. You yourself, too, are of the same mind,
I am well assured. Whatever method, therefore, you deem successful for the discovery of
truth, do not shrink from using it. For, by following a better course of argument, you will
not only confer a benefit on yourself, but most assuredly on me also, instructing me concerning
matters of which I am ignorant.”</p>
<p>“You seem clearly to agree with3745 me, that things evil are in some sort substances:3746
for, apart from substances, I do not see them to have any existence. Since, then, my good
friend, you say that things evil are substances, it is necessary to inquire into the nature of
substance. Is it your opinion that substance is a kind of bodily structure?”3747</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“And does that bodily structure exist by itself, without the need of any one to come and
give it existence?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And does it seem to you that things evil are connected with certain courses of action?”</p>
<p>“That is my belief.”</p>
<p>“And do actions come into existence only when an actor is there?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And, when there is no actor, neither will his action ever take place?”</p>
<p>“It will not.”</p>
<p>“If, therefore, substance is a kind of bodily structure, and this does not stand in need of
some one in and through whom it may receive its existence, and if things evil are actions of
some one, and actions require some one in and through whom they receive their existence,—
things evil will ‘not’ be substances. And if things evil are not substances, and murder
3745 Migne, instead of παραστῆναι, conjectures παραστῆσαι, which, however, would not suit what appears
to be the meaning.
<note type="footnote">3746 Οὐσίας τινάς.</note>
<note type="footnote">3747 Σωματικήν τινα σύστασιν.</note>

<pb n="2050"/>
is an evil, and is the action of some one, it follows that murder is not a substance. But, if
you insist that agents are substance, then I myself agree with you. A man, for instance, who
is a murderer, is, in so far as he is a man, a substance; but the murder which he commits is
not a substance, but a work of the substance. Moreover, we speak of a man sometimes as
bad because he commits murder; and sometimes, again, because he performs acts of beneficence,
as good: and these names adhere to the substance, in consequence of the things
which are accidents of it, which, however, are not the substance itself. For neither is the
substance murder, nor, again, is it adultery, nor is it any other similar evil. But, just as the
grammarian derives his name from grammar, and the orator from oratory, and the physician
from physic, though the substance is not physic, nor yet oratory, nor grammar, but receives
its appellation from the things which are accidents of it, from which it popularly receives
its name, though it is not any one of them,—so in like manner it appears to me that the
substance receives name from things regarded as evil, though it is not itself any one of them.</p>
<p>“I must beg you also to consider that, if you represent some other being as the cause of
evil to men, he also, in so far as he acts in them, and incites them to do evil, is himself evil,
by reason of the things he does. For he too is said to be evil, for the simple reason that he
is the doer of evil things; but the things which a being does are not the being himself, but
his actions, from which he receives his appellation, and is called evil. For if we should say
that the things he does are himself, and these consist in murder, and adultery, and theft,
and such-like, these things will be himself. And if these things are himself, and if when they
take place they get to have a substantial existence,3748 but by not taking place they also cease
to exist, and if these things are done by men,—men will be the doers of these things, and
the causes of existing and of no longer existing. But, if you affirm that these things are his
actions, he gets to be evil from the things he does, not from those things of which the substance
of him consists.</p>
<p>“Moreover, we have said that he is called evil from those things which are accidents of
the substance, which are not themselves the substance: as a physician from the art of physic.
But, if he receives the beginning of his existence from the actions he performs, he too began
to be evil, and these evil things likewise began to exist. And, if so, an evil being will not be
without a beginning, nor will evil things be unoriginated, since we have said that they are
originated by him.”</p>
<p>“The argument relating to the opinion I before expressed, you seem to me, my friend,
to have handled satisfactorily: for, from the premises you assumed in the discussion, I think
you have drawn a fair conclusion. For, beyond doubt, if matter was at first destitute of
qualities, and if God is the fashioner of the qualities it now has, and if evil things are qualities,
God is the author of those evil things. The argument, then, relating to that opinion we may
<note type="footnote">3748 Τὴν σύστασιν ἔχει.</note>

<pb n="2051"/>
consider as well discussed, and to me it now seems false to speak of matter as destitute of
qualities. For it is not possible to say of any substance3749 whatsoever that it is without
qualities. For, in the very act of saying that it is destitute of qualities, you do in fact indicate
its quality, representing of what kind matter is, which of course is ascribing to it a species
of quality. Wherefore, if it is agreeable to you, rehearse the argument to me from the beginning:
for, to me, matter seems to have had qualifies from all eternity.3750 For in this way I
can affirm that evil things also come from it in the way of emanation, so that the cause of
evil things may not be ascribed to God, but that matter may be regarded as the cause of all
such things.”</p>
<p>“I approve your desire, my friend, and praise the zeal you manifest in the discussion of
opinions. For it assuredly becomes every one who is desirous of knowledge, not simply and
out of hand to agree with what is said, but to make a careful examination of the arguments
adduced. For, though a disputant, by laying down false premises, may make his opponent
draw the conclusion he wishes, yet he will not convince a hearer of this; but only when he
says that which3751 it seems possible to say with fairness. So that one of two things will
happen: either he will, as he listens, be decisively helped to reach that conclusion towards
which he already feels himself impelled, or he will convict his adversary of not speaking the
truth.</p>
<p>“Now, it seems to me that you have not sufficiently discussed the statement that matter
has qualities from the first. For, if this is the case, what will God be the maker of? For, if
we speak of substances, we affirm these to exist beforehand; or if again of qualities, we declare
these also to exist already. Since, therefore both substance and qualities exist, it seems to
me unreasonable to call God a creator.</p>
<p>“But, lest I should seem to be constructing an argument to suit my purpose, be so good
as to answer the question: In what way do you assert God to be a creator? Is He such because
He changed the substances, so that they should no longer be the same as they had once been
but become different from what they were; or because, while He kept the substances the
same as they were before that period, He changed their qualities?”</p>
<p>“I do not at all think that any alteration took place in substances: for it appears to me
absurd to say this. But I affirm that a certain change was made in their qualities; and it is
in respect of these that I speak of God as a creator. Just as we might happen to speak of a
house as made out of stones, in which case we could not say that the stones no longer continue
to be stones as regards their substance, now that they are made into a house (for I affirm
that the house owes its existence to the quality of its construction, forasmuch as the previous
<note type="footnote">3749 Migne reads οὐσίας for αἰτίας.</note>
<note type="footnote">3750 ᾽Ανάρχως.</note>
<note type="footnote">3751 Reading, with Migne, εἰ ὅ τι for εἴ τι.</note>

<pb n="2051"/>
quality of the stones has been changed),—so does it seem to me that God, while the substance
remains the same, has made a certain change in its qualities; and it is in respect of such
change that I speak of the origin of this world as having come from God.”</p>
<p>“Since, then, you maintain that a certain change—namely, of qualities—has been produced
by God, answer me briefly what I am desirous to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Proceed, pray, with your question.”</p>
<p>“Do you agree in the opinion that evil things are qualities of substances?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Were these qualities in matter from the first, or did they begin to be?”</p>
<p>“I hold that these qualifies existed in combination with matter, without being originated.”</p>
<p>“But do you not affirm that God has made a certain change in the qualities?”</p>
<p>“That is what I affirm.”</p>
<p>“For the better, or for the worse?”</p>
<p>“For the better, I should say.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, if evil things are qualities of matter, and if the Lord of all changed its qualities
for the better, whence, it behoves us to ask, come evil things? For either the qualities
remained the same in their nature as they previously were, or, if they were not evil before,
but you assert that, in consequence of a change wrought on them by God, the first qualities
of this kind came into existence in connection with matter,—God will be the author of evil,
inasmuch as He changed the qualities which were not evil, so as to make them evil.</p>
<p>“Possibly, however, it is not your view that God changed evil qualities for the better;
but you mean that all those other qualities which happened to be neither good nor bad,3752
were changed by God with a view to the adornment of the creation.”</p>
<p>“That has been my opinion from the outset.”</p>
<p>“How, then, can you say that He has left the qualities of bad things just as they were?</p>
<p>Is it that, although He was able to destroy those qualities as well as the others, He was not
willing; or did He refrain because He had not the power? For, if you say He had the power,
but not the will, you must admit Him to be the cause of these qualities: since, when He
could have put a stop to the existence of evil, He chose to let it remain as it was, and that,
too, at the very time when He began to fashion matter. For, if He had not concerned Himself
at all with matter, He would not have been the cause of those things which He allowed to
remain. But, seeing that He fashioned a certain part of it, and left a certain part as we have
described it, although He could have changed that also for the better, it seems to me that
He deserves to have the blame cast on Him, for having permitted a part of matter to be evil,
to the ruin of that other part which He fashioned.</p>
<note type="footnote">3752 Or “indifferent:” ἀδιάφοροι.</note>

<pb n="2053"/>
<p>“Nay, more, it seems to me that the most serious wrong has been committed as regards
this part, in that He constituted this part of matter so as to be now affected by evil. For, if
we were to examine carefully into things, we should find that the condition of matter is
worse now than in its former state, before it was reduced to order. For, before it was separated
into parts, it had no sense of evil; but now every one of its parts is afflicted with a sense of
evil.</p>
<p>“Take an illustration from man. Before he was fashioned, and became a living being
through the art of the Creator, he was by nature exempt from any contact whatever with
evil; but, as soon as ever he was made by God a man, he became liable to the sense of even
approaching evil: and thus that very thing which you say was brought about by God for the
benefit of matter,3753 is found to have turned out rather to its detriment.</p>
<p>“But, if you say that evil has not been put a stop to, because God was unable to do away
with it, you will be making God powerless. But, if He is powerless, it will be either because
He is weak by nature, or because He is overcome by fear, and reduced to subjection by a
stronger. If, then, you go so far as to say that God is weak by nature, it seems to me that
you imperil your salvation itself; but, if you say that He is weak through being overcome by
fear of a greater, things evil will be greater than God, since they frustrate the carrying out
of His purpose. But this, as it seems to me, it would be absurd to say of God. For why should
not ‘they’ rather be considered gods, since according to your account they are able to overcome
God: if, that is to say, we mean by God that which has a controlling power over all
things?</p>
<p>“But I wish to ask you a few questions concerning matter itself. Pray tell me, therefore,
whether matter was something simple or compound. I am induced to adopt this method
of investigating the subject before us by considering the diversity that obtains in existing
things. For, if perchance matter was something simple and uniform, how comes it that the
world is compound,3754 and consists of divers substances and combinations? For by
‘compound’ we denote a mixture of certain simple elements. But if, on the contrary, you
prefer to call matter compound, you will, of course, be asserting that it is compounded of
certain simple elements. And, if it was compounded of simple elements, these simple elements
must have existed at some time or other separately by themselves, and when they
were compounded together matter came into being: from which it of course follows that
matter is created. For, if matter is compound, and compound things are constituted from
simple, there was once a time when matter had no existence,—namely, before the simple
elements came together. And, if there was once a time when matter was not, and there was
never a time when the uncreated was not, matter cannot be uncreated. And hence there
<note type="footnote">3753 Migne reads ἐπ᾽ εὐεργεσίᾳ for ἐστὶν εὐεργεσία.</note>

<pb n="2054"/>
will be many uncreated substances. For, if God was uncreated, and the simple elements out
of which matter was compounded were also uncreated, there will not be two uncreated
things only,—not to discuss the question what it is which constitutes objects simple,
whether matter or form.</p>
<p>“Is it, further, your opinion that nothing in existence is opposed to itself?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“Is water, then, opposed to fire?”</p>
<p>“So it appears to me.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, is darkness opposed to light, and warm to cold, and moreover moist to dry?”</p>
<p>“It seems to me to be so.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, if nothing in existence is opposed to itself, and these things are opposed to
each other, they cannot be one and the same matter; no, nor yet be made out of one and the
same matter.</p>
<p>“I wish further to ask your opinion on a matter kindred to that of which we have been
speaking. Do you believe that the parts of a thing are not mutually destructive?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“And you believe that fire and water, and so on, are parts of matter?”</p>
<p>“Quite so.”</p>
<p>“Do you not also believe that water is subversive of fire, and light of darkness, and so
of all similar things?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, if the parts of a whole are not mutually destructive, and yet the parts of
matter are mutually destructive, they cannot be parts of one matter. And, if they are not
parts of one another, they cannot be composed of one and the same matter; nay, they cannot
be matter at all, since nothing in existence is destructive of itself, as we learn from the doctrine
of opposites: for nothing is opposed to itself—an opposite being by nature opposed to
something else. White, for example, is not opposed to itself, but is said to be the opposite
of black; and, similarly, light is shown not to be opposed to itself, but is considered an opposite
in relation to darkness; and so of a very great number of things besides. If, then,
matter were some one thing, it could not be opposed to itself. This, then, being the nature
of opposites, it is proved that matter has no existence.”’</p>

<p>Claudius Apollinaris,3755 Bishop of Hierapolis, and Apologist.</p>
<p><del>a.d. 160–180.</del> This author, an early apologist, is chiefly interesting as a competent
witness, who tells the story of the Thundering Legion3756 in an artless manner, and gives it
the simple character of an answer to prayer. This subject is treated by Lightfoot, in his recent
work on the Apostolic Fathers,3757 in an exhaustive manner; and the story, reduced to the
simple narrative as Apollinaris gives it, receives from him a just and discriminating approval.</p>
<p>Apollinaris, as well as Rhodon, has been imagined the author of the work (ascribed to
Asterius Urbanus) against Montanism, dedicated to Abiricius Marcellus.3758 This is sufficiently
refuted by Routh,3759 whose Greek text, with notes, must be consulted by the studious.</p>
<p>Apollinaris was bishop of Hierapolis on the Mæander, and, Lightfoot thinks, was
probably with Melito and Polycrates, known to Polycarp, and influenced by his example
and doctrine.3761 He addressed his Apology, which is honourably mentioned by Jerome,
to M. Antoninus, the emperor. He also wrote Adversus Gentes and De Veritate; also against
the Jews. Serapion calls him3762 “most blessed.”</p>

who are at a wide remove from the doctrines that prevail among us, and who have been
simply concerned to describe what related to the emperors who are the subjects of their
history; and it has been recorded also by our own writers. But historians without the pale
of the Church, as being unfriendly to the faith, while they have recorded the prodigy, have
refrained from acknowledging that it was sent in answer to our prayers. On the other hand,
our writers, as lovers of truth, have reported the matter in a simple and artless way. To this

<head>Polycrates,3767 Bishop of Ephesus.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 130–196.</del> This author3768 comes in as an appendix to the stories of Polycarp and
Irenæus and good Anicetus, and his writings also bear upon the contrast presented by the
less creditable history of Victor. If, as I suppose, the appearance of our Lord to St. John on
“the Lord’s day” was on the Paschal Sunday, it may at first seem surprising that this Apostle
can be claimed by Polycrates in behalf of the Eastern custom to keep Easter, with the Jews,
on the fourteenth day of the moon. But to the Jews the Apostles became “as Jews” in all
things tolerable, so long as the Temple stood, and while the bishops of Jerusalem were labouring
to identify the Paschal Lamb with their Passover. The long survival of St. John
among Jewish Christians led them to prolong this usage, no doubt, as sanctioned by his
example. He foreknew it would quietly pass away. The wise and truly Christian spirit of
Irenæus prepared the way for the ultimate unanimity of the Church in a matter which lies
at the base of “the Christian Sabbath,” and of our own observance of the first day of the
week as a weekly Easter. Those who in our own times have revived the observance of the
Jewish Sabbath, show us how much may be said on their side,3769 and elucidate the tenacity
of the Easterns in resisting the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance as to the Paschal, although
they agreed to keep it “not with the old leaven.”</p>
<p>Our author belonged to a family in which he was the eighth Christian bishop; and he
presided over the church of Ephesus, in which the traditions of St. John were yet fresh in
men’s minds at the date of his birth. He had doubtless known Polycarp, and Irenæus also.
He seems to have presided over a synod of Asiatic bishops (a.d. 196) which came together
to consider this matter of the Paschal feast. It is surely noteworthy that nobody doubted
that it was kept by a Christian and Apostolic ordinance. So St. Paul argues from its Christian
observance, in his rebuke of the Corinthians.3770 They were keeping it “unleavened” ceremonially,
and he urges a spiritual unleavening as more important. The Christian hallowing
of Pentecost connects with the Paschal argument.3771 The Christian Sabbath hinges on
these points.</p>

John, moreover, who reclined on the Lord’s bosom, and who became a priest wearing the

bishop and martyr at Smyrna; and Thraseas from Eumenia, both bishop and martyr, who
rests at Smyrna. Why should I speak of Sagaris, bishop and martyr, who rests at Laodicea?
of the blessed Papirius, moreover? and of Melito the eunuch,3779 who performed all his actions

from heaven, when he shall rise again from the dead? These all kept the passover on the

it, but keeping to the rule of faith.</p>

use concerning the Paschal, he evidently means Asia Minor, as in the Scriptures and elsewhere.
3784 Throughout “the rest of the world,” he testifies, however, that such was not the
use. The Palestinian bishops, after the Jewish downfall, seem to have been the first to comprehend
the propriety of adopting the more Catholic usage; and our author presided over
a council in Cæsarea, of which he was bishop, assisted by Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem,
with Cassius of Tyre and Clarus of Ptolemais, which confirmed it. It is to be noted, that
Alexandria is cited by Theophilus as authority for this custom; and it is not quite correct to
say that the Western usage prevailed at Nicæa, for it was the general use, save only in Asia
Minor and churches which were colonies of the same. This fact has been overlooked, and
is very important, in history.</p>

by many;3802 whose robberies and other deeds of daring, for which he has been
punished, it is not necessary for us to speak of, since the treasury3803 has him in keeping.
Which of them, then, condones the sins of the other? The prophet the robberies of the
martyr, or the martyr the covetousness of the prophet? For whereas the Lord has said,
“Provide not gold, nor silver, nor two coats a-piece,”3804 these men have, on the flat contrary,
transgressed the command by the acquisition of these forbidden things. For we shall show
that those who are called among them prophets and martyrs obtain money not only from
the rich, but also from the poor, from orphans and widows. And if they are confident that
they are right in so doing, let them stand forward and discuss the point, in order that, if they
be refuted, they may cease for the future so to transgress. For the fruits of the prophet must
needs be brought to the test: for “from its fruit is the tree known.”3805 But that those that
desire it may become acquainted with what relates to Alexander, he was condemned by
Æmilius Frontinus, proconsul at Ephesus, not on account of the name of Christ, but for the
daring robberies he committed when he was already a transgressor.3806 Afterwards, when
he had spoken falsely of the name of the Lord, he was released, having deceived the faithful
there;3807 and even the brethren of his own district,3808 from which he came, did not receive
him, because he was a robber. Thus, those who wish to learn what he is, have the public
treasury of Asia to go to. And yet the prophet, although he spent many years with him,

<p><del>a.d. 182–192–212.</del> The world owes more to Pantænus than to all the other Stoics put
together. His mind discovered that true philosophy is found, not in the Porch, but in Nazareth,
in Gethsemane, in Gabbatha, in Golgotha; and he set himself to make it known to
the world. We are already acquainted with the great master of Clement,3812 “the Sicilian
bee,” that forsook the flowers of Enna, to enrich Alexandria with what is “sweeter than
honey and the honey-comb;” and we remember that he became a zealous missionary to the
Oriental Ethiopia, and found there the traces of St. Matthias’ labours, and those also of St.
Bartholomew. From this mission he seems to have returned about a.d. 192. Possibly he
was master of the Alexandrian school before he went to India, and came back to his chair
when that mission was finished. There he sat till about a.d. 212, and under him this Christian
academy became famous. It had existed as a catechetical school from the Apostles’
time, according to St. Jerome. I have elsewhere noted some reasons for supposing that its
founder may have been Apollos.3813 All the learning of Christendom may be traced to this
source; and blessed be the name of one of whom all we know is ennobling to the Church,

the Christians supposed God to become acquainted with the universe,3821 their own opinion
being that He obtains His knowledge of it in different ways,—of things falling within the
province of the understanding by means of the understanding, and of those within the region
of the senses by means of the senses,—they replied: “Neither does He gain acquaintance
with sensible things by the senses, nor with things within the sphere of the understanding
by the understanding: for it is not possible that He who is above all existing things should
apprehend them by means of existing things. We assert, on the contrary, that He is acquainted
with existing things as the products of His own volition.”3822 They added, by way of
showing the reasonableness of their view: “If He has made all things by an act of His will
(and no argument will be adduced to gainsay this), and if it is ever a matter of piety and
rectitude to say that God is acquainted with His own will, and if He has voluntarily made
every several thing that has come into existence, then surely God must be acquainted with
all existing things as the products of His own will, seeing that it was in the exercise of that
will that He made them.”</p>

<head>Pseud-Irenæus.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 177.</del> This letter should have been made a preface to the works of Irenæus, or at
least an appendix. It is worthy of his great name; “the finest thing of the kind in all antiquity,”
says Lardner. Critics of no mean name have credited it to Irenæus; but, as this cannot be
proved, I have accordingly marked it as a pseudonym. The same writer condenses the arguments
of others, on which he decides to adhere to the later chronology of Eusebius, assigning
its date to the seventeenth year of Marcus Aurelius.3823 Naturally humane and comparatively
gentle in other respects he was; but Stoicism, as well as heathenism, showed what it could
exact of such a character in maintenance of the popular and imperial superstitions. Terrible
is the summary of Lightfoot concerning the barbarities of this darling of the “philosophers:”
“It is a plain fact, that Christian blood flowed more freely under M. Aurelius than at any
time previously during the half century since the Bithynian martyrdoms under Trajan, or
was yet to flow at any time during the decades which would elapse before the Severian persecution.
These persecutions extend throughout his reign: they were fierce and deliberate;
aggravated, at least in some cases, by cruel tortures. They had the emperor’s direct personal
sanction. They break out in all parts of the empire,—in Rome, in Asia Minor, in Gaul, in
Africa, possibly also in Byzantium.”</p>
<p>Bishop Lightfoot accounts for the fact, that, in spite of this sanguinary character of the
period, little complaint is heard from the suffering Church, by a simple statement which is
honourable to Aurelius as a Roman and an emperor. He was such a contrast to the Neros
and Caligulas, that the wretched Romans loved him as a father; to reproach him was,
therefore, poor policy for Christians. They would have been answered, practically: “If so
good a sovereign finds it necessary to punish you, the fault is your own; you have only to
be as we are, and he will treat you as well as he does us.”</p>
<p>Of this awful outbreak in Lyons and Vienne, says Lightfoot:3824 “The persecution was
wholesale, so that it was not safe for any Christian to appear out of doors. No difference of
age or sex was made. The prisoners were put to the most cruel tortures. All the elements
of power combined to crush the brethren.”</p>
<p>To forbear threatenings, to revile not again, to conquer through patient suffering, to
persevere, “looking unto Jesus,” and to be silent, like Him, before their murderers, was
therefore the world-wide conduct of the saints. This golden letter shows what they were
called to endure, and how they glorified Christ by their deaths, from the utmost Orient to
the extreme limits of the West.</p>

<p>The Letter of the Churches of Vienna and Lugdunum to the Churches of Asia and

<p>It began thus:—“The servants of Christ who sojourn in Vienna and Lugdunum of Gaul
to the brethren throughout Asia and Phrygia, who have the same faith and hope of redemption
as ourselves, peace, grace, and glory from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our
Lord.”</p>
<p>After some further preliminary remarks the letter proceeds:—“The greatness of the
tribulation in this region, and the exceeding anger of the heathen nations against the saints,
and the sufferings which the blessed Witnesses3826 endured, neither are we competent to
describe accurately, nor indeed is it possible to detail them in writing. For with all his
strength did the adversary assail us, even then giving a foretaste of his activity among us
which is to be without restraint; and he had recourse to every means, accustoming his own
subjects and exercising them beforehand against the servants of God, so that not only were
we excluded from houses,3827 baths, and the forum, but a universal prohibition was laid
against any one of us appearing in any place whatsoever. But the grace of God acted as our
general against him. It rescued the weak; it arrayed against him men like firm pillars, who
could through patience bear up against the whole force of the assaults of the wicked one.
These came to close quarters with him, enduring every form of reproach and torture; and,
making light of grievous trials, they hastened on to Christ, showing in reality that the ‘sufferings
of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed
in us.’3828 And first they nobly endured the evils which were heaped on them by the
populace,—namely, hootings and blows, draggings, plunderings, stonings, and confinements,
3829 and everything that an infuriated mob is wont to perpetrate against those whom
they deem bitter enemies. And at length, being brought to the forum by the tribune of the

<p>“After this, when they were brought before the governor, and when he displayed a
spirit of savage hostility to us, Vettius Epagathus, one of the brethren, interposed. For he
was a man who had contained the full measure of love towards God and his neighbours.
His mode of life had been so strict, that though he was a young man, he deserved to be described
in the words used in regard to the elderly Zacharias: ‘He had walked therefore in
all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.’3830 He was also eager to
serve his neighbour in any way, he was very zealous for God, and he was fervent in spirit.
Such being the character of the man, he could not bear that judgment should be thus unreasonably
passed against us, but was moved with indignation, and requested that he himself
should be heard in defence of his brethren, undertaking to prove that there is nothing ungodly
or impious amongst us. On this, those who were round the judgment-seat cried out against
him, for he was a man of distinction; and the governor, not for a moment listening to the
just request thus made to him, merely asked him if he himself were a Christian. And on his
confessing in the clearest voice that he was, he also was taken up into the number of the
Witnesses, receiving the appellation of the Advocate of the Christians,3831 and having
himself the Advocate, the Spirit,3832 more abundantly than Zacharias; which he showed in
the fulness3833 of his love, in that he had of his own good-will offered to lay down his own
life in defence of the brethren. For he was and is a genuine disciple of Christ, ‘following the
Lamb whithersoever He goeth.’3834</p>
<p>“After this the rest began to be distinguished,3835 for the proto-martyrs were decided
and ready, and accomplished the confession of their testimony with all alacrity. But there
appeared also those who were unprepared and unpractised, and who were still feeble, and
unable to bear the tension of a great contest. Of these about ten in number proved abortions;
causing great grief and immeasurable sorrow amongst us, and damping the ardour of the
rest who had not yet been apprehended. For these, although they suffered every kind of
cruelty, remained nevertheless in the company of the Witnesses, and did not forsake them.

But then the whole of us were greatly alarmed on account of our uncertainty as to confession,
not because we feared the tortures inflicted, but because we looked to the end, and dreaded
lest any one should fall away. Those who were worthy, however, were daily apprehended,
filling up the number of the others: so that out of the two churches all the excellent, and
those to whom the churches owed most of all their establishment and prosperity, were collected
together in prison. Some heathen household slaves belonging to our people were
also apprehended, since the governor had given orders publicly that all of us should be
sought out. These, through the instigation of Satan, and through fear of the tortures which
they saw the saints enduring, urged on also by the soldiers, falsely accused us of Thyestean
banquets and OEdipodean connections, and other crimes which it is lawful for us neither to
mention nor think of; and, indeed, we shrink from believing that any such crimes have ever
taken place among men. When the rumour of these accusations was spread abroad, all
raged against us like wild beasts; so that if any formerly were temperate in their conduct to
us on account of relationship, they then became exceedingly indignant and exasperated
against us. And thus was fulfilled that which was spoken by our Lord: ‘The time shall come
when every one who slayeth you shall think that he offereth service to God.’3836</p>
<p>“Then at last the holy Witnesses suffered tortures beyond all description, Satan striving
eagerly that some of the evil reports might be acknowledged by them.3837 But in an exceeding
degree did the whole wrath of mob, general, and soldiers fall on Sanctus, a deacon from
Vienna, and on Maturus, a newly-enlightened but noble combatant, and on Attalus, a native
of Pergamus, who had always been the Pillar3838 and foundation of the church there, and
on Blandina, through whom Christ showed that the things that to men appear mean and
deformed and contemptible, are with God deemed worthy of great glory, on account of love
to Him,—a love which is not a mere boastful appearance, but shows itself in the power which
it exercises over the life. For while we were all afraid, and especially her mistress in the flesh,
who was herself one of the combatants among the Witnesses, that she would not be able to
make a bold confession on account of the weakness of her body, Blandina was filled with
such power, that those who tortured her one after the other in every way from morning till
evening were wearied and tired, confessing that they had been baffled, for they had no other

The latter in this passage seems unquestionably to be the meaning.</note>

torture they could apply to her; and they were astonished that she remained in life, when
her whole body was torn and opened up, and they gave their testimony3839 that one only
of the modes of torture employed was sufficient to have deprived her of life, not to speak
of so many excruciating inflictions. But the blessed woman, like a noble athlete, recovered
her strength in the midst of the confession; and her declaration, ‘I am a Christian, and there
is no evil done amongst us,’ brought her refreshment, and rest, and insensibility to all the
sufferings inflicted on her.</p>
<p>“Sanctus also nobly endured all the excessive and superhuman3840 tortures which man
could possibly devise against him; for the wicked hoped, on account of the continuance and
greatness of the tortures, to hear him confess some of the unlawful practices. But he opposed
them with such firmness that he did not tell them even his own name, nor that of his nation
or city, nor if he were slave or free; but in answer to all these questions, he said in Latin, ‘I
am a Christian.’ This was the confession he made repeatedly, instead of giving his name,
his city, his race, and indeed in reply to every question that was put to him; and other language
the heathens heard not from him. Hence arose in the minds of the governor and the
torturers a determined resolution to subdue him; so that, when every other means failed,
they at last fixed red-hot plates of brass to the most delicate parts of his body. And these
indeed were burned, but he himself remained inflexible and unyielding, firm in his confession,
being bedewed and strengthened by the heavenly fountain of the water of life which issues
from the belly of Christ.3841 But his body bore witness to what had happened: for it was
all wounds and weals, shrunk and torn up, and had lost externally the human shape. In
him Christ suffering wrought great wonders, destroying the adversary, and showing for an
example to the rest that there is nothing fearful where there is the Father’s love, and nothing
painful where there is Christ’s glory. For the wicked after some days again tortured the
Witness, thinking that, since his body was swollen and inflamed, if they were to apply the
same tortures they would gain the victory over him, especially since the parts of his body
could not bear to be touched by the hand, or that he would die in consequence of the tortures,
and thus inspire the rest with fear. Yet not only did no such occurrence take place in regard
to him, but even, contrary to every expectation of man, his body unbent itself and became
<note type="footnote">3839 Heinichen construes differently. He makes the “torturers astonished that Blandina gave her testimony
that one kind of torture was sufficient to deprive her of life.” Perhaps the right construction is to make ὅτι mean
“because” or “for:” “They were astonished as Blandina bearing her testimony, for one kind of torture was sufficient
to have killed her.”
3840 The words ὑπερβεβλημένως καὶ ὑπὲρ πάντα ἄνθρωπον naturally go with ὑπομένων, and therefore intimate
that Sanctus’ endurance was greater than human; but we doubt if this is intended by the writer.</note>

erect in the midst of the subsequent tortures, and resumed its former appearance and the
use of its limbs, so that the second torture turned out through the grace of Christ a cure,
not an affliction.</p>
<p>“Among those who had denied was a woman of the name of Biblias. The devil, thinking
that he had already swallowed her, and wishing to damn her still more by making her accuse
falsely, brought her forth to punishment, and employed force to constrain her, already feeble
and spiritless, to utter accusations of atheism against us. But she, in the midst of the tortures,
came again to a sound state of mind, and awoke as it were out of a deep sleep; for the temporary
suffering reminded her of the eternal punishment in Gehenna, and she contradicted
the accusers of Christians, saying, ‘How can children be eaten by those who do not think it
lawful to partake of the blood of even brute beasts?’ And after this she confessed herself a
Christian, and was added to the number of Witnesses.</p>
<p>“But when the tyrannical tortures were rendered by Christ of no avail through the patience
of the blessed, the devil devised other contrivances—confinement in the darkest and
most noisome cells of the prison, the stretching of the feet on the stocks,3842 even up to the
fifth hole, and the other indignities which attendants stirred up by wrath and full of the
devil are wont to inflict on the imprisoned. The consequence was, that very many were
suffocated in prison, as many at least as the Lord, showing His glory, wished to depart in
this way. For there were others who were tortured so bitterly, that it seemed impossible for
them to survive even though they were to obtain every kind of attention; and yet they remained
alive in prison, destitute indeed of care from man, but strengthened by the Lord,
and invigorated both in body and soul, and they animated and consoled the rest. But the
new converts who had been recently apprehended, and whose bodies had not previously
been tortured, could not indure the confinement, but died in the prison.</p>
<p>“Now the blessed Pothinus, who had been entrusted with the service of the bishopric
in Lugdunum, was also dragged before the judgment-seat. He was now upwards of ninety
years of age, and exceedingly weak in body. Though he breathed with difficulty on account
of the feebleness of the body, yet he was strengthened by the eagerness of his spirit, on account
of his earnest desire to bear his testimony. His body, indeed, was already dissolved through
old age and disease, yet the life was preserved in him, that Christ might triumph through
him. When he was brought by the soldiers to the judgment-seat, under a convoy of the
magistrates of the city, and amid exclamations of every kind from the whole population, as
if he himself were the Christ, he gave the good testimony. Being asked by the governor who
was the God of the Christians, he said, ‘If thou art worthy, thou shalt know.’ Thereupon he

was unmercifully dragged about, and endured many blows; for those who were near maltreated
him in every way with their hands and feet, showing no respect for his age, while
those at a distance hurled against him each one whatever came to hand, all of them believing
that they would sin greatly and act impiously if they in any respect fell short in their insulting
treatment of him. For they thought that in this way they would avenge their gods. And
Pothinus, breathing with difficulty, was cast into prison, and two days after he expired.</p>
<p>“Upon this a grand dispensation3843 of God’s providence took place, and the immeasurable
mercy of Jesus was made manifest,—such an occurrence as but rarely happens among
the brotherhood, yet one that does not fall short of the art of Christ. For those who in the
first apprehension had denied, were imprisoned along with the others, and shared their
hardships. Their denial, in fact, turned out at this time to be of no advantage to them. For
while those who confessed what they really were, were imprisoned simply as Christians, no
other accusation being brought against them, those who denied were detained as murderers
and profligates. They, moreover, were doubly punished. For the confessors were lightened
by the joy of their testimony and their hope in the promises, and by their love to Christ, and
by the Father’s Spirit. But the deniers were tormented greatly by their own consciences, so
that when they were led forth their countenances could be distinguished among all the rest.
For the confessors went forth joyous, with a mingling of glory and abundant grace in their
looks, so that their chains lay like becoming ornaments around them, as around a bride
adorned with golden fringes wrought with divers colours.3844 And they breathed at the
same time the fragrance of Christ,3845 so that some even thought that they were anointed
with this world’s perfume. But the deniers were downcast, humbled, sad-looking, and
weighed down with every kind of disgrace. They were, moreover, reproached even by the
heathens with being base and cowardly, and charged with the crime of murder; they had
lost the altogether honourable, glorious, and life-giving appellation.3846 When the rest saw
this, they were strengthened, and those who were apprehended confessed unhesitatingly,
not allowing the reasoning of the devil to have even a place in their thoughts.”</p>
<p>Eusebius omits something, saying that after a little the letter proceeded as follows:—</p>
<p>“After these things, then, their testimonies took every shape through the different ways
in which they departed.3847 For, plaiting a crown from different colours and flowers of
<note type="footnote">3843 The dispensation is, that those who denied were not set free, but confined with the others; and that this
harsh treatment and sad state of mind confirmed the resolution of those not yet apprehended to confess Christ.

every kind, they presented it to the Father. It was right therefore that the noble athletes,
after having endured divers contests and gained grand victories, should receive the great
crown of incorruption.</p>
<p>“Maturus, therefore, and Sanctus, and Blandina, and Attalus were publicly3848 exposed
to the wild beasts—that common spectacle of heathen barbarity; for a day was expressly
assigned to fights with wild beasts on account of our people. And Maturus and Sanctus
again endured every form of torture in the amphitheatre, as if they had had no suffering at
all before. Or rather, like athletes who had overthrown their adversary several times,3849
and were now contending for the crown itself, again they endured the lashes3850 which were
usual there; and they were dragged about by the wild beasts, and suffered every indignity
which the maddened populace demanded in cries and exhortations proceeding from various
parts of the amphitheatre. And last of all they were placed in the iron chair, on which their
bodies were roasted, and they themselves were filled with the fumes of their own flesh. But
the heathens did not stop even here, but became still more frantic in their desire to overcome
the endurance of the Christians. But not even thus did they hear anything else from Sanctus
than the utterance of the confession which he had been accustomed to make from the beginning.
These, then, after life had lasted a long time throughout the great contest, were at
782
last sacrificed,3851 after they alone had formed a spectacle to the world, throughout that
day, instead of all the diversity which usually takes place in gladiatorial shows.</p>
<p>“Blandina3852 was hung up fastened to a stake, and exposed, as food to the wild beasts
that were let loose against her; and through her presenting the spectacle of one suspended
on something like a cross, and through her earnest prayers, she inspired the combatants
with great eagerness: for in the combat they saw, by means of their sister, with their bodily
eyes, Him who was crucified for them, that He might persuade those who trust in Him that
every one that has suffered for the glory of Christ has eternal communion with the living

were again formed into pairs by lot, until finally there should be but one pair left. See the process at the Olympic
games described in Lucian Hermotimus, c. xl. p. 782.</note>

God. When none of the wild beasts at that time touched her, she was taken down from the
stake and conveyed back to prison. She was thus reserved for another contest, in order that,
gaining the victory in many preparative conflicts, she might make the condemnation of the
Crooked Serpent3853 unquestionable, and that she might encourage the brethren. For
though she was an insignificant, weak, and despised woman, yet she was clothed with the
great and invincible athlete Christ. On many occasions she had overpowered the adversary,
and in the course of the contest had woven for herself the crown of incorruption.</p>
<p>“Attalus also was vehemently demanded by the mob; for he was a man of mark. He
entered the lists a ready combatant on account of his good conscience, since he had been
truly practised in the Christian discipline, and had always been a Witness of the truth among
us. He was led round the amphitheatre, a tablet going before him, on which was written in
Latin, ‘This is Attalus the Christian;’ and the people swelled with indignation against him.
But the governor, learning that he was a Roman, ordered him to be taken back to prison
and kept with the rest who were there, with regard to whom he had written to the Cæsar,
and was now awaiting his determination.</p>
<p>“The intervening time did not prove barren or unfruitful to the Witnesses, but through
their patient endurance the immeasurable love of Christ was made manifest. For through
the living the dead were made alive; and the Witnesses conferred favours on those who were
not Witnesses, and the Virgin Mother had much joy in receiving back alive those whom
she had given up as dead abortions. For through the Witnesses the greater number of those
who had denied returned, as it were, into their mother’s womb, and were conceived again
and re-quickened; and they learned to confess. And being now restored to life, and having
their spirits braced, they went up to the judgment-seat to be again questioned by the governor,
while that God who wishes not the death of the sinner,3854 but mercifully calls to repentance,
put sweetness into their souls. This new examination took place because the Cæsar had
given orders that the Witnesses should be punished, but that if any denied they should be
set free. And as now was commencing here the fair, which is attendee by vast numbers of
men assembling from all nations, he brought the blessed up to the judgment-seat, exhibiting
them as a theatrical show and spectacle to the mobs. Wherefore also he again questioned
them, and whoever appeared to have had the rights of Roman citizenship he beheaded, and
the rest he sent to the wild beasts.</p>
<p>“Now Christ was greatly glorified in those who formerly denied; for, contrary to every
expectation of the heathen, they confessed. For these were examined separately, under the
belief that they were to be set free; but confessing, they were added to the number of the
Witnesses. But there were also some who remained without; namely, those who had no

<pb n="2077"/>
trace of faith, and no perception of the marriage garment,3855 nor notion of the fear of God,
but through their conduct caused evil reports of our way of life, that is, sons of perdition.
But all the rest were added to the Church.</p>
<p>“Present at the examination of these was one Alexander, a native of Phrygia, a physician
by profession. He had lived for many years in Gaul, and had become well known to all for
his love to God and his boldness in proclaiming the truth, for he was not without a share
of apostolic grace. He stood near the judgment-seat, and, urging by signs those who had
denied to confess, he looked to those who stood round the judgment-seat like one in travail.
But the mobs, enraged that those who had formerly denied should now confess, cried out
against Alexander as if he were the cause of this change. Then the governor summoned
him before him, and inquired of him who he was; and when Alexander said he was a
Christian, the governor burst into a passion, and condemned him to the wild beasts. And
on the next day he entered the amphitheatre along with Attalus; for the governor, wishing
to gratify the mob, again exposed Attalus to the wild beasts. These two, after being tortured
in the amphitheatre with all the instruments devised for that purpose, and having undergone
an exceedingly severe contest, at last were themselves sacrificed. Alexander uttered no groan
or murmur of any kind, but conversed in his heart with God; but Attalus, when he was
placed on the iron chair, and all the parts of his body were burning, and when the fumes
from his body were borne aloft, said to the multitude in Latin, ‘Lo! this which ye do is eating
men. But as for us, we neither eat men nor practise any other wickedness.’ And being asked
what name God has, he answered, ‘God has not a name as men have.’</p>
<p>“After all these, on the last day of the gladiatorial shows, Blandina was again brought
in along with Ponticus, a boy of about fifteen years of age. These two had been taken daily
to the amphitheatre to see the tortures which the rest endured, and force was used to compel
them to swear by the idols of the heathen; but on account of their remaining stedfast, and
setting all their devices at nought, the multitude were furious against them, so as neither to
pity the tender years of the boy nor to respect the sex of the woman. Accordingly they exposed
them to every terror, and inflicted on them every torture, repeatedly trying to compel
them to swear. But they failed in effecting this; for Ponticus, encouraged by his sister,3856
so plainly indeed that even the heathens saw that it was she that encouraged and confirmed
him, after enduring nobly every kind of torture, gave up the ghost; while the blessed
<note type="footnote">3855 Heinichen renders “the bride’s garment,” and explains in the following manner. The bride is the Church,
the garment Christ, and the sons of perdition had no ideas what garment the Church of Christ should wear, had
no idea that they should be clothed with Christ, and be filled with His Spirit. It is generally taken to be the
marriage garment of Matt. xxii. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">3856 She may have been his sister by birth, as some have supposed, but the term “sister” would have been
applied had she been connected by no other tie than that of a common faith.</note>

<pb n="2078"/>
Blandina, last of all, after having like a noble mother encouraged her children, and sent
them on before her victorious to the King, trod the same path of conflict which her children
had trod, hastening on to them with joy and exultation at her departure, not as one thrown
to the wild beasts, but as one invited to a marriage supper. And after she had been scourged
and exposed to the wild beasts, and roasted in the iron chair, she was at last enclosed in a
net and cast before a bull. And after having been well tossed by the bull, though without
having any feeling of what was happening to her, through her hope and firm hold of what
had been entrusted to her and her converse with Christ, she also was sacrificed, the heathens
themselves acknowledging that never among them did woman endure so many and such
fearful tortures.</p>
<p>“Yet not even thus was their madness and their savage hatred to the saints satiated. For
wild and barbarous tribes, when excited by the Wild Beast, with difficulty ceased from their
rage, and their insulting conduct found another and peculiar subject in the bodies of the
Witnesses. For they felt no shame that they had been overcome, for they were not possessed
of human reason; but their defeat only the more inflamed their rage, and governor and
people, like a wild beast, showed a like unjust hatred of us, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
‘He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
still.’3857 For they threw to the dogs those who had been suffocated in prison, carefully
watching them day and night, lest any one should receive burial from us. They then laid
out the mangled remains left by the wild beasts, and the scorched remains left by the fire,
and the heads of the rest along with their trunks, and in like manner for many days watched
them lying unburied with a military guard. There were some who raged and gnashed their
teeth at them, seeking to get from them further vengeance. Others derided and insulted
them, at the same time magnifying their own idols, and ascribing to them the punishment
inflicted on the Christians. There were persons also of a milder disposition, who to some
extent seemed to sympathize; yet they also frequently upbraided, saying, ‘Where now is
their God, and what good have they got from that religion which they chose in preference
to their life?’ Such was the diversity which characterized the conduct of the heathens. But
our state was one of deep sorrow that we could not bury the bodies. For night aided us not
in this matter; money failed to persuade, and entreaty did not shame them into compliance;
but they kept up the watch in every way, as if they were to gain some great advantage from
the bodies of the Christians not obtaining burial.</p>
<p>Something is omitted. The letter then goes on:—</p>
<p>“The bodies of the Witnesses, after having been maltreated in every way, and exposed
in the open air for six days, were burned, reduced to ashes, and swept by the wicked into
the river Rhone, which flows past, in order that not even a vestige of them might be visible

on earth. And these things they did, as if they had been able to overcome God, and deprive
them of their second birth,3858 in order, as they said, that ‘they may not have hope in a resurrection,
trusting to which they introduce some strange and new mode of worship, and
despise dangers, and go readily and with joy to death. Now let us see if they will rise again,
and if their God can help them, and rescue them out of our hands.’”</p>
<p>Eusebius here breaks off his series of continuous extracts, but he makes a few more for
special purposes. The first is the account which the churches gave of the character of the
Witnesses:—</p>
<p>“Who also were to such an extent zealous followers and imitators of Christ, who, being
in the shape of God, thought it not an object of desire to be treated like God;3859 that though
they were in such glory, and had borne their testimony not once, nor twice, but often, and
had been again taken back to prison after exposure to the wild beasts, and bore about with
them the marks of the burnings and bruises and wounds all over their bodies, yet did they
neither proclaim themselves Witnesses, nor indeed did they permit us to address them by
this name; but if any one of us on any occasion, either by letter or in conversation, called
them Witnesses, they rebuked him sharply. For they willingly gave the title of Witness to
Christ, ‘the faithful and true Witness,’3860 and first-born from the dead, and the leader to
the divine life. And they reminded us of those Witnesses who had already departed, and
said: ‘These indeed are now Witnesses, whom Christ has vouchsafed to take up to Himself
in the very act of confession, thus putting His seal upon their testimony through their departure.
But we are mean and humble confessors.’ And with tears they besought the brethren
that earnest prayers might be made for their being perfected. They in reality did all that is
implied in the term ‘testimony,’ acting with great boldness towards all the heathen; and
their nobleness they made manifest through their patience, and fearlessness, and intrepidity.
But the title of Witness, as implying some superiority to their brethren,3861 they refused,
being filled with the fear of God.”</p>
<p>After a little they say:—</p>
<p>“They humbled themselves3862 under the powerful hand by which they are now highly
exalted. Then they pleaded for all,3863 but accused none; they absolved all, they bound none;

‘Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.’3864 But if he prayed for those who stoned him, how
much more for the brethren!”</p>
<p>After other things, again they say:—</p>
<p>“For they had this very great conflict with him, the devil, on account of their genuine
love, in order that the Beast being choked, might vomit forth those whom he thought he
had already swallowed. For they assumed no airs of superiority over the fallen, but with
those things in which they themselves abounded they aided the needy, displaying towards
them the compassion of a mother. And pouring out many tears for them to the Father, they
begged life;3865 and He gave it to them, and they shared it with their neighbours. And departing
victorious over all to God, having always loved peace, and having recommended
peace to us, in peace they went to God, leaving no sorrow to their Mother, nor division and
dissension to their brethren, but joy and peace, and concord and love.”</p>
<p>“The same writing of the fore-mentioned martyrs,” says Eusebius, “contains a story
worth remembrance.</p>
<p>“For there was one of them of the name of Alcibiades, who lived an exceedingly austere
life, confining his diet to bread and water, and partaking of nothing else whatsoever. He
tried to continue this mode of life in prison; but it was revealed to Attalus after the first
conflict which he underwent in the amphitheatre that Alcibiades was not pursuing the right
course in refusing to use the creatures of God, and in leaving an example which might be a
stumbling-block to others. And Alcibiades was persuaded, and partook freely of all kinds
of food, and thanked God. For they were not without the oversight of the grace of God, but
the Holy Spirit was their counsellor.”
defended themselves before all.” Heinichen has justified the translation in the text by an appeal to a passage in
Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., iv. 15.</p>

<p>(In every succession, p. 764.)</p>
<p>Here our author mentions that he noted the succession of Bishops at Rome, but he gives
his list with no remark about Rome in particular. He adds that “in every succession and in
every city (i.e., in every See) a primitive accordance with the law and the Gospel is maintained.”
How can our excellent Lightfoot3866 give it a colour wholly gratuitous in these
words: “He interested himself in the succession of the Roman See, intent, like Irenæus in
the next generation, on showing the permanence of the orthodox tradition, through the
continuity of the Roman episcopate.” Irenæus, who, above all the Westerns, is identified
with the Orient!</p>
<p>Where is the evidence of any such idea or “intent”? As for Irenæus, his testimony has
been sufficiently illustrated before, with proof that his words have not the slightest reference
to the continuity of the Roman more than any other See, save only as the influx of visitors
from other Sees helped to give it orthodoxy by their concurrent testimony.3867</p>

<head>Note.</head>
<p>It may be worth while to state here, that I have uniformly (mistakes excepted) put my
chronological statements, at the head of introductions, into brackets, so as to make the
reader sure that the Edinburgh edition is not to be responsible for them. Some have inferred,
therefore, that what follows is from the Edinburgh; but I think my modes of expression
sufficient, generally, to guard against misconception. Notes (like this) are sometimes marked,
“By the American Editor,” when I have feared a misleading ambiguity. Otherwise, I have
been unguarded. All the introductions in these “Remains” are mine, save the prefatory
paragraphs of the translator on pp. 747, 748. Annotations on my own material are not
bracketed. The very large amount of work bestowed upon this edition can only be known
by comparison with the Edinburgh. In several instances of delicate criticism I have obtained
valuable aid from my beloved friend, F. P. Nash, Esq., of Hobart College, especially in
questions of the low Latin or ambiguous Greek.</p>

<p>Life of Our Most Holy Father St. Benedict by Gregory the Great
Written by 6th century Pope St. Gregory I, this text is one of the only ancient accounts of
St. Benedict's life and work. St. Gregory first introduces the life of Benedict with information
about his birthplace in Italy, his parentage, and his primary education. St. Gregory tells us
that at an early age, St. Benedict abandoned all worldly cares to seek a life of close union
with God. In his adulthood, St. Benedict built twelve monasteries and was believed to have
performed numerous miracles. St. Benedict is largely known for his book The Rule of St.
Benedict, a collection of spiritual and administrative instructions for monks--as a result of
this achievement, St. Benedict is often recognized as the founder of Western monasticism.
The second half of St. Gregory's text is the reproduction of St. Benedict's seventy-three
chapter Rule. Although St. Gregory never engaged with St. Benedict himself, he was able to
craft this illuminating portrait of St. Benedict's life by consulting several of St. Benedict's
close disciples and successors.

<p>ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus by
Philip Schaff</p>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. This particular volume contains works by St. Clement,
Mathetes, St. Polycarp, St. Ignatius, Barnabas, St. Papias, St. Justin Martyr, and St. Irenaeus.
These writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason, as they
are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes also come with many useful notes,
providing the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any
part of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.

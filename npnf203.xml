<head>NPNF2-03. Theodoret, Jerome, Gennadius, U+0026
Rufinus: Historical Writings</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.The Nicene and Post-
Nicene Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide
keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from
some of the great theologians of the Christian church.These
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over
a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even
today!

<p>Book I 1244</p>
<p>Preface. 1244</p>
<p>It is hard that an old friend with whom I had been reconciled should attack 
me in a book secretly circulated among his disciples.1246</p>
<p>Others have translated Origen. Why does he single me out? 1248</p>
<p>He gave me fictitious praise in his Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. Now, since I 
defend myself, he writes 3 books against me as an enemy.1249</p>
<p>He spoke of me as united in faith with him; but what is his faith? Why are his 
books kept secret? I can meet any attack.1250</p>
<p>He spoke of me as united in faith with him; but what is his faith? Why are his 
books kept secret? I can meet any attack.1251</p>
<p>I translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν because you demanded it, and because his 
translation slurred over Origen's heresies.1252</p>
<p>My translation put away ambiguities, and showed the real character of the 
book, and of the previous translation.1253</p>
<p>My translation of Origen's Commentaries created no excitement; his first 
translation, of Pamphilus' Apology, roused all Rome to indignation.1254</p>
<p>But the work was really Eusebius's, who tells us that Pamphilus wrote nothing. 1255</p>
<p>After the condemnation of Origen by Theophilus and Anastasius, it would 
be wise in Rufinus to give up this pretended defence.1256</p>
<p>I had praised Eusebius as well as Origen only as writers; and was forced to
condemn them as heretics. Why should this be taken amiss?1257</p>
<p>I wrote a friendly letter to Rufinus, which my friends kept back. 1259</p>
<p>There is nothing to blame in my getting the help of a Jew in translating from
the Hebrew.1260</p>
<p>There is nothing strange in my praising Origen before I knew the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. 1261</p>
<p>The accusations seem inconsistent, but I knew them only by report. 1262</p>
<p>The office of a commentator. 1263</p>
<p>We must distinguish methods of writing, and not expect a vulgar simplicity 
in the various compositions of cultured men.1264</p>
<p>My assertion was true, that Origen permitted the use of falsehood. 1266</p>
<p>The accusation about a mistranslation of Ps. ii is easily explained. 1268</p>
<p>In the difficulties of the translator and the commentator we must get help 
where we can.1269</p>

<pb n="xxviii"/>
<p>In the Commentary on Ephesians I acted straightforwardly in giving the views 
of Origen and others.1270</p>
<p>As to the passage “He hath chosen us before the foundation of the world.” 1271</p>
<p>As to the passage “Far above all rule and authority U+0026c.” 1273</p>
<p>As to the passage “That in the ages to come U+0026c.“ 1274</p>
<p>As to “Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ.” 1275</p>
<p>As to “The body fitly framed U+0026c.” 1276</p>
<p>I quoted Origen's views as, “According to another heresy.” 1277</p>
<p>As to “Men loving their wives as their own bodies.” 1278</p>
<p>As to “Men loving their wives as their own bodies.” 1279</p>
<p>To the charge of reading secular books I reply that I remember what I learned
in youth.1281</p>
<p>Also, a promise given in a dream must not be pressed. Why should such things 
be raked up by old friends against one another?1284</p>
<p>I am right in my contention that all sins are remitted in baptism. 1286</p>

<p>It is not permitted to you to be ignorant of such a matter which all the churches 
know.1299</p>
<p>As to translating the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, it is not a question, but a charge that you 
unjustifiably altered the book.1301</p>
<p>Origen asserts Christ to be a creature, and maintains universal restitution.
Where has he contradicted this?1304</p>
<p>Origen asserts Christ to be a creature, and maintains universal restitution.
Where has he contradicted this?1305</p>
<p>The question is, as Anastasius says to John of Jerusalem, with what motive 
you translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν.1306</p>
<p>You pretend not to be Origen's defender, but you publish and enlarge the 
Apology for him and allege the heretics' falsification of his works.1307</p>
<p>Your defence gains no support from Eusebius or Didymus, who, each for his 
own reason, defend the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν as it stands.1309</p>
<p>If we may allege falsification at every turn we make a chaos of all past literature. 1310</p>
<p>The object of Origen's letter, of which he translates only a part, is not to shew 
the falsification of his writings but to vituperate the Bishops who condemned
him.1312</p>
<p>It is only in reference to a particular point in his dispute with Candidus that 
Origen alleges this falsification. The story of Hilary's being condemned through
his writings having been falsified has no foundation.1314</p>
<p>That which you tell about myself in Damasus' council is mere after-dinner 
gossip.1316</p>

stories were not found in the Hebrew.1326</p>

of Origen.1344</p>

Pamphilus.1345</p>

insinuate.1358</p>

that he had come to distrust you.1359</p>
<p>When we parted as friends I believed you a true believer; no one was sent to 
Rome to injure you.1361</p>

you, and I have given a full answer about my translations already.1362</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>This volume contains the following works:</p>
<p>I. Theodoret: Church History, Dialogues, and Letters. Translated, with ample Prolegomena
and explanatory notes, by the Rev. Blomfield Jackson, M.A., Rector of St. Bartholomew’s,
Cripplegate, London.</p>
<p>II. Jerome and Gennadius: Lives of Illustrious Men. Translated, with introduction and
notes, by Ernest Cushing Richardson, Ph.D., Librarian of Princeton College.</p>
<p>III. Rufinus: Apology against Jerome, and Jerome: Apology in reply to Rufinus; Rufinus:
Commentary on the Apostles’ Creed, and Prefaces to his translations of the Clementine Recognitions,
the Sayings of Xystus, Eusebius’s Church History, and several of Origen’s works;
translated, with notes, and an introduction on the Life and Works of Rufinus by the Hon.
and Rev. Wm. Henry Fremantle, M.A., Canon of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The English reader has now, in the first three volumes of this Library, a complete collection
of the historical writings of the Fathers, whose permanent value, as sources, is universally
acknowledged. Several of them have never before appeared in English.</p>
<p>The unavoidable delay in the publication of the third volume has been very annoying
to the general editors and publishers, but the subscribers will be amply compensated by the
addition of the writings of Rufinus, which were not promised in the prospectus.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that this difficult and costly enterprise is beginning to be duly appreciated
by competent judges on both sides of the Atlantic. It is especially gratifying to read
from a thorough patristic scholar of the Anglican Church such a hearty commendation of
the first volume (the work of two young American divines), as appeared in “The Church
Quarterly Review” for April, 1892. We share in his hope (p. 125) that the labors of Dr. Mc-
Giffert and Dr. Richardson will stimulate a new and critical edition of all the historical works
of Eusebius, after the model set by Bishop Lightfoot in his Apostolic Fathers, and that one
of the English University Presses will consider it an honor to undertake the expense of
publication.</p>

<head>Translator’s Preface.</head>
<p>The following translation has been made from the edition published in Migne’s Patrologia.
The plan originally proposed was, in the case of the History, to make a revision of an
existing translation. This was, however, after a brief trial, abandoned, and the translation
has throughout been made entirely fresh. The Letters, so far as the translator is aware, have
never been published in English before. The notes indicate with sufficient clearness to whom
he is indebted for such elucidation of the text as he may have been enabled to furnish.
Conscious of its imperfections, and not confident that revision can have removed all blemishes
and errors, he yet puts forth this English version of the History, Dialogues, and Letters
of Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, in the hope that he may not have done great injustice to
their holy and learned author.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<p>I.—Parentage, Birth, and Education.
At Antioch at the close of the fourth century there were living a husband and wife, opulent
and happy in the enjoyment of all the good things of this life, one thing only excepted.
They were childless. Married at seventeen, the young bride lived for several years in the
enjoyment of such pleasures as wealth and society could give. At the age of twenty-three
she was attacked by a painful disease in one of her eyes, for which neither the books of older
authorities nor later physiological discoveries could suggest a remedy. One of her domestic
servants, compassionating her distress, informed her that the wife of Pergamius, at that time
in authority in the East, had been healed of a similar ailment by Petrus, a famous Galatian
solitary who was then living in the upper story of a tomb in the neighbourhood, to which
access could only be obtained by climbing a ladder. The afflicted lady, says the story which
her son himself repeats,1 hastened to climb to the recluse’s latticed cell, arrayed in all her
customary elaborate costume, with earrings, necklaces, and the rest of her ornaments of
gold, her silk robe blazing with embroidery, her face smeared with red and white cosmetics,
and her eyebrows and eyelids artificially darkened. “Tell me,” said the hermit, on beholding
his brilliant visitor, “tell me, my child, if some skilful painter were to paint a portrait according
to his art’s strict rules and offer it for exhibition, and then up were to come some dauber
dashing off his pictures on the spur of the moment, who should find fault with the artistic
picture, lengthen the lines of brows and lids, make the face whiter and heighten the red of
the cheeks, what would you say? Do you not think the original painter would be hurt at this
insult to his art and these needless additions of an unskilled hand.” These arguments, we
learn, led eventually to the improvement of the young Antiochene gentlewoman both in
piety and good taste and her eye is said to have been restored to health by the imposition
of the sign of the cross. Not impossibly the discontinuance of the use of cosmetics may have
helped, if not caused, the cure.</p>
<p>Six years longer the husband and wife lived together a more religious life, but still unblessed
with children. Among the ascetic solitaries whom the disappointed husband begged
to aid him in his prayers was one Macedonius, distinguished, from the simplicity of his diet,
<note type="footnote">1 Relig. Hist. 1188 et seq.</note>

<pb n="14"/>
as “the barley eater.” In answer to his prayers, it was believed, a son was at last granted to
the pious pair.2 The condition of the boon being that the boy should be devoted to the divine
service, he was appropriately named at his birth “Theodoretus,” or “Given by God.”3 Of the
exact date of this birth, productive of such important consequences to the history and literature
of the Church, no precise knowledge is attainable. The less probable year is 386 as
given by Garnerius,4 the more probable and now generally accepted year 393 follows the
computation of Tillemont.5</p>
<p>While yet in his swaddling bands the little Theodoret began to receive training appropriate
to his high career,6 and, as he himself tells us, with the pardonable exaggeration of
enthusiasm, was no sooner weaned than he began to learn the apostolic teaching. Among
his earliest impressions were the lessons and exhortations of Peter of Galatia, to whom his
mother owed so much, and of Macedonius “the barley eater,” who had helped to save the
Antiochenes in the troubles that arose about the statues.7 Of the latter8 Theodoret quotes

profited better by the solitary’s solemn entreaties. If however Macedonius was indeed quite
ignorant of the Scriptures,9 it may have been well for the boy’s education to have been not
wholly in his hands. It is not impossible that he may have had a childish recollection of
Chrysostom, who left Antioch in 398. To Peter he used to pay a weekly visit, and records10
how the holy man would take him on his knees and feed him with bread and raisins. A
treasure long preserved in the household of Theodoret’s parents was half Peter’s girdle,
woven of coarse linen, which the old man had one day wound round the loins of the boy.

led to its loss, for all the neighbours used to borrow it to cure their own complaints, and at
last an unkind or careless friend omitted to return it.11</p>
<p>When a stripling Theodoret was blessed by the right hand of Aphraates the monk, of
whom he relates an anecdote in his Ecclesiastical History,12 and when his beard was just
beginning to grow was also blessed by the ascetic Zeno.13 At this period he was already a
lector14 and was therefore probably past the age of eighteen. By this time his general education
would be regarded as more or less complete, and to these earlier years may be traced
the acquaintance which he shows with the writings of Homer, Thucydides, Plato, Euripides,
and other Greek classics. Lighter literature, too, will not have been excluded from his reading,
if we accept the genuineness of the famous letter on the death of Cyril,15 and may infer that
the dialogues of Lucian are more likely to have amused the leisure hours of a lad at school
and college than have intruded on the genuine piety and marvellous industry of the Bishop
of Cyrus.</p>

that the scientists of the thirty-fourth century may smile benevolently at some of the cherished remedies of the

the Church,” p. 303, n. “The letter from which these passages are taken was read as Theodoret’s at the fifth
General Council (fifth Session) and there accepted as his. But on questions of this kind Councils are not infallible;
and the letter contains a note of spuriousness in purporting to be addressed to John, bishop of Antioch, who
died before Cyril. I own that the suggestion that for ‘John’ we ought to read ‘Domnus’ does not suffice to remove
suspicion from my mind. But it is solely for the reason just stated that I feel no confidence in accepting the letter
as Theodoret’s. Newman’s opinion that it is incredible Theodoret could have written so ‘atrocious’ a letter is
one which it is amazing should be held by any one familiar with the controversial amenities of the time. Our
modern urbanity is willing to bury party animosities in the grave; but in the fifth century Swift’s translation
would be thought the only proper one of the maxim ‘De mortuis nil nisi bonum,’ ‘when scoundrels die let all
bemoan them.’ Certainly the man who half a dozen years after Chrysostom’s death spoke of him as Judas
Iscariot had no right to expect to be politely treated after his own death by one whom he had relentlessly persecuted.”
Glubowski, whose great work on Theodoret now in progress is unfortunately a sealed volume to the majority of
the readers on account of its being written in the author’s native Russian, is of opinion that the letter is spurious. See also
Schröckh Kircheges. xviii. 370. I am myself unable to see the force of the internal evidence of spuriousness. It may have
been half playful, and never meant for publication.</note>

<p>Theodoret was familiar with Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew, but is said to have been unacquainted
with Latin.16 Such I presume to be an inference from a passage in one of his works17
in which he tells us “The Romans indeed had poets, orators, and historians, and we are informed
by those who are skilled in both languages that their reasonings are closer than the
Greeks‘ and their sentences more concise. In saying this I have not the least intention of
disparaging the Greek language which is in a sense mine,18 or of making an ungrateful return
to it for my education, but I speak that I may to some extent close the lips and lower the
brows of those who make too big a boasting about it, and may teach them not to ridicule a
language which is illuminated by the truth.’ But it is not clear from these words that
Theodoret had no acquaintance with Latin. His admiration for orthodox Western theology
as well as his natural literary and social curiosity would lead him to learn it. In the Ecclesiastical
History (III. 16) there is a possible reference to Horace.</p>
<p>Theodoret’s chief instructor in Theology was the great light of the school of Antioch,
Theodorus, known from the name of the see to which he was appointed in 392, “Mopsuestia,”
or “the hearth of Mopsus,” in Cilicia Secunda. He also refers to his obligations to Diodorus
of Tarsus.19 Accepting 393 as the date of his birth and 392 as that of Theodore’s appointment
to his see, it would seem that the younger theologian must have been rather a reader than
a hearer as well of Theodore as of Diodore. But Theodore expounded Scripture in many
churches of the East.20 The friendship of Theodoret for Nestorius may have begun when
the latter was a monk in the convent of St. Euprepius at the gates of Antioch. It is recorded21
that on one occasion Theodore gave offence while preaching at Antioch by refusing to give
to the blessed Virgin the title θεοτόκος. He afterwards retracted this refusal for the sake of
peace. The original objection and subsequent consent have a curious significance in view
of the subsequent careers of his two famous pupils. Of the school of Antioch as distinguished
from that of Alexandria it may be said broadly that while the latter shewed a tendency to
syntheticism and to unity of conception, the former, under the influence of the Aristotelian
philosophy, favoured analytic processes.22 And while the general bent of the school of
thinkers among whom Theodoret was brought up inclined to a recognition of a distinction
between the two natures in the Person of Christ, there was much in the special teaching of
its great living authority which was not unlikely to lead to such division of the Person as

was afterwards attributed to Nestorius.23 Such were the influences under which Theodoret
grew up.</p>
<p>On the death of his parents he at once distributed all the property that he inherited from
them, and embraced a life of poverty,24 retiring, at about the age of three and twenty, to
Nicerte, a village three miles from Apamea, and seventy-five from Antioch, in the monastery
of which he passed seven calm and happy years, occasionally visiting neighbouring monasteries
and perhaps during this period paying the visit to Jerusalem which left an indelible
impression on his memory. “With my own eyes,” he writes,25 “I have seen that desolation.
The prediction rang in my ears when I saw the fulfillment before my eyes and I lauded and
worshipped the truth.” Of the peace of Theodoret’s earlier manhood Dr. Newman26 says
in a sentence less open to criticism than another which shall be quoted further on, “There
he laid deep within him that foundation of faith and devotion, and obtained that vivid apprehension
of the world unseen and future which lasted him as a secret spring of spiritual
strength all through the conflict and sufferings of the years that followed.”</p>

<head>II.—Episcopate at Cyrus.</head>
<p>Cyrus or Cyrrhus was a town of the district of Syria called after it Cyrestica. The capital
of Cyrestica was Gindarus, which Strabo describes27 as being in his time a natural nest of
robbers. Cyrus lies on a branch of the river OEnoparas, now Aphreen, and the site is still
known as Koros. A tradition has long obtained that it received the name of Cyrus from the
Jews in honour of their great benefactor, but this is more than doubtful. The form Cyrus
may have arisen from a confusion with a Cyrus in Susiana.28 The Cyrestica is a fertile plain
lying between the spurs of the Alma Dagh and the Euphrates, irrigated by three streams and
blessed with a rich soil. The diocese, which was subject to the Metropolitan of Hierapolis,
contained some sixteen hundred square miles29 and eight hundred distinct parishes each
with its church.30 But Cyrus itself was a wretched little place31 scantily inhabited. Before it
was beautified by the munificence of Theodoret it contained no buildings of any dignity or
grace. The people of the town as well as of the diocese seem to have been poor in orthodoxy
as well as in pocket, and the rich soil of the district grew a plentiful crop of the tares of
Arianism, Marcionism, Eunomianism and Judaism.32</p>
<p>Such was the diocese to which Theodoret, in spite of his honest nolo episcopari,33 was
consecrated at about the age of thirty, a.d. 423. Of the circumstances of this consecration
we have no evidence. Garnerius conjectures that he must have been ordained deacon by
Alexander who succeeded Porphyrius at Antioch. He was probably appointed, if not consecrated,
to succeed Isidorus at Cyrus, by Theodotus the successor of Alexander on the patriarchal
throne of Antioch. In this diocese certainly for five and twenty years, perhaps for five
and thirty, with occasional intervals he worked night and day with unflagging patience and
perseverance for the good of the people committed to his care, and in the cause of his Master
and of the truth. The ecclesiastic of these early times is sometimes imagined to have been a
morose and ungenial ascetic, wasting his energies in unprofitable hair-splitting, and taking
little or no interest in the every day needs of his contemporaries. In marked contrast with
this imaginary bishop stands out the kindly figure of the real bishop of Cyrus, as the modest
statements and hints supplied by his own letters enable us to recall him.</p>
<p>As an administrator and man of business he was munificent and efficient. Stripped, as
we have already learnt, of his family property by his own act and will, he must have been

dependent in his diocese on the revenues of his see. From these, which cannot have been
small, he was able to spend large sums on public works. Cyrus was adorned with porticoes,
with two great bridges, with baths, and with an aqueduct, all at Theodoret’s expense.34 On
assuming the administration of his diocese he took measures, he tells us,35 to secure for
Cyrus “the necessary arts,” and from these three words we need not hesitate to infer that
architects, engineers, masons, sculptors, and carpenters, would be attracted “from all quarters”
to the bishop’s important works. And for this increased population it is interesting to note
that Theodoret provided competent practitioners in medicine and surgery, in which it would
seem he was not himself unskilled.36 His keen interest in the temporal needs of his people
is shown by the efforts he made to obtain relief for them from the cruel pressure of exorbitant
taxation.37 So unendurable was the tale of imposts under which they groaned that in many
cases they were deserting their farms and the country, and he earnestly appeals to the empress
Pulcheria and to his friend Anatolius to help them.38 The tender sympathy felt by him for
all those afflicted in body and estate, as well as in mind, is shown in his letters on behalf of
Celestinianus, or Celestiacus, a gentleman of position at Carthage, who had suffered cruelly
during the attack of the Vandals,39 and in the admirable and touching letters of consolation
addressed to survivors on the deaths of relatives. That these should have been religiously
preserved need excite no surprise.40 Of the terms on which he lived with his neighbours we
can form some idea from the justifiable boast contained in his letter to Nomus. In the quarter
of a century of his episcopate, he writes, he never appeared in court either as prosecutor or
defendant; his clergy followed his admirable example; he never took an obol or a garment
from any one; not one of his household ever received so much as a loaf or an egg; he could
not bear to think that he had any property beyond his few poor clothes.41 Yet he was always
ready to give where he would not receive, and in addition to all the diocesan and literary
work which he conscientiously performed, he spent more time than he could well afford in
all sorts of extra diocesan business which his position thrust in his way.</p>
<p>As a shepherd of souls he was unceasing in his efforts to win heathen, heretics and Jews
to the true faith. His diocese, when he assumed its government, was a very hotbed of heresy.42

Nevertheless in the famous letter to Leo43 he could boast that not a tare was left to spoil the
crop. His fame as a preacher was great and wide, and makes us the more regret that of the
discourses which in turn roused, cheered, and blamed, so little should survive. The eloquence,
so to say, of his extant writings, gives indications of the force of spoken utterances not less
marked by learning and literary skill. Two of his letters give vivid pictures of the enthusiasm
of oriental auditories in Antioch, once so populous and so keen in theological interest, where
now, amid a people numbering only about a fiftieth part of their predecessors of the fifth
century, there is not a single church. We see the patriarch John in a frenzy of gladness at
Theodoret’s sermons, clapping his hands and springing again and again from his chair;44
we see the heads of the congregation receiving the bishop of Cyrus with frantic delight as
he came down from the pulpit, flinging their arms round him, kissing now his head, now
his breast, now his hands, now his knees, and hear them exclaiming, “This is the Voice of
the Apostle!”45 But Theodoret had to encounter sometimes the fury of opposition. Again
and again in his campaign against heretics and unbelievers he was stoned, wounded, and
brought nigh unto death.46 “He from whom no secrets are hid knows all the bruises my
body has received, aimed at me by ill-named heretics, and what fights I have fought in most

<head>III.—Relations with Nestorius and to Nestorianism.</head>
<p>Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, was bound by ties of close friendship both to
Theodoret and to John, patriarch of Antioch. In August, 430, the western bishops, under
the presidency of the Pope Celestine, assembled in council at Rome, condemned Nestorius,
and threatened him with excommunication. Shortly afterwards a council of Orientals at
Alexandria, summoned by Cyril, endorsed this condemnation and despatched it to Constantinople.
Then John received from Celestine and Cyril letters announcing their common
action. When the couriers conveying these communications reached Antioch they found
John surrounded by Theodoret and other bishops who were assembled possibly for the ordination
of Macarius, the new bishop of Laodicea. John took counsel with his brother
bishops, and a letter was despatched in their common name to Nestorius, exhorting him to
accept the term θεοτόκος, round which the whole war waged; pointing out the sense in
which it could not but be accepted by every loyal Christian, and imploring him not to embroil
Christendom for a word. This letter has been generally attributed to Theodoret. But while
the conciliatory sage of Cyrus was endeavouring to formulate an Eirenicon, the ardent
Egyptian made peace almost impossible by the publication of his famous anathematisms.
John and his friends were distressed at the apparent unorthodoxy of Cyril’s condemnation
of Nestorius, and asked Theodoret to refute Cyril.48 The strong language employed in Letter
CL. conveys an idea of the heat of the enthusiasm with which Theodoret entered on the
task, and his profound conviction that Cyril, in blind zeal against imaginary error on the
part of Nestorius, was himself falling headlong into the Apollinarian pit. An eager war of
words now waged over Nestorius between Cyril and Theodoret, each denouncing the other
for supposed heresy on the subject of the incarnation; and, with deep respect for the learning
and motives of Theodoret, we may probably find a solution of much that he said and did
in the fact that he misunderstood Nestorius as completely as he did Cyril.49 Cyril, nursed
in the synthetic principles of the Alexandrian school, could see only the unity of the two
natures in the one Person. To him, to distinguish, as the analysis of Theodoret distinguished,
between God the Word and Christ the Man, was to come perilously near a recognition of
two Christs, keeping up as it were a mutual dialogue of speech and action. But Cyril’s unqualified
assertion that there is one Christ, and that Christ is God, really gave no ground
for the accusation that to him the manhood was an unreality. Yet he and Theodoret were
substantially at one. Theodoret’s failure to apprehend Cyril’s drift was no doubt due less to
any want of intelligence on the part of the Syrian than to the overbearing bitterness of the
fierce Egyptian.</p>
<note type="footnote">48 Vide the Anathematisms and Theodoret’s refutation in the Prolegomena.</note>
<note type="footnote">49 cf. Glubokowski p. 98.</note>

<pb n="22"/>
<p>On the other hand Theodoret’s loyal love for Nestorius led him to give his friend credit
for meaning what he himself meant. While he was driven to contemplate the doctrines of
Cyril in their most dangerous exaggeration, he shrank from seeing how the Nestorian counter
statement might be dangerously exaggerated. Theodoret, as Dr. Bright remarks,50 “uses a
good deal of language which is prima facie Nestorian; his objections are pervaded by an ignoratio
elenchi, and his language is repeatedly illogical and inconsistent; but he and Cyril
were essentially nearer to each other in belief than at the time they would have admitted,
for Theodoret virtually owns the personal oneness and explains the phrase ‘God assumed
man’ by ‘He assumed manhood.’” Cyril “in his letter to Euoptius earnestly disclaims both
forms of Apollinarianism—the notion of a mindless manhood in Christ and the notion of
a body formed out of Godhead. In his reply (on Art iv.) he admits the language appropriate
to each nature.”</p>
<p>Probably both the Egyptian and the Syrian would have found no difficulty in subscribing
the language of our own judicious divine; “a kind of mutual commutation there is whereby
those concrete names, God and Man, when we speak of Christ, do take interchangeably one
another’s room, so that for truth of speech it skilleth not whether we say that the Son of God
hath created the world and the Son of Man by his death hath saved it or else that the Son of
Man did create, and the Son of God died to save the world. Howbeit, as oft as we attribute
to God what the manhood of Christ claimeth, or to man what his Deity hath right unto, we
understand by the name of God and the name of Man neither the one nor the other nature,
but the whole person of Christ, in whom both natures are. When the Apostle saith of the
Jews that they crucified the Lord of Glory, and when the Son of Man being on earth affirmeth
that the Son of Man was in heaven at the same instant, there is in these two speeches that
mutual circulation before mentioned. In the one there is attributed to God or the Lord of
Glory death, whereof divine nature is not capable; in the other ubiquity unto man, which
human nature admitteth not. Therefore by the Lord of Glory we must needs understand
the whole person of Christ, who being Lord of Glory, was indeed crucified, but not in that
nature for which he is termed the Lord of Glory. In like manner by the Son of Man the whole
person of Christ must necessarily be meant, who being man upon earth, filled heaven with
his glorious presence, but not according to that nature for which the title of Man is given
him. Without this caution the Fathers whose belief was divine and their meaning most
sound, shall seem in their writing one to deny what another constantly doth affirm. Theodoret
disputeth with great earnestness that God cannot be said to suffer. But he thereby meaneth
Christ’s divine nature against Apollinarius, which held even Deity itself passible. Cyril on
the other side against Nestorius as much contendeth that whosoever will deny very God to
have suffered death doth forsake the faith. Which notwithstanding to hold were heresy, if
<note type="footnote">50 Dict. Christ Biog. i. 767.</note>

<pb n="23"/>
the name of God in this assertion did not import as it doth the person of Christ, who being
verily God suffered death, but in the flesh, and not in that substance for which the name of
God is given him.”51</p>
<p>As to the part played by Theodoret throughout the whole controversy we may conclude
that though he had to own himself beaten intellectually, yet the honours of the moral victory
remain with him rather than with his illustrious opponent. Not for the last time in the history
of the Church a great duel of dialectic issued in a conclusion wherein of the champion who
was driven to say, “I was wrong,” the congregation of the faithful has yet perforce felt that
he was right.</p>
<p>The end is well known. Theodosius summoned the bishops to Ephesus at the Pentecost
of 431. There arrived Cyril with fifty supporters early in June; there arrived Theodoret with
his Metropolitan Alexander of Hierapolis, in advance of the rest of the Orientals. The
Cyrillians were vainly entreated to wait for John of Antioch and his party, and opened the
Council without them. When they arrived they would not join the Council, and set up their
own “Conciliabulum” apart. Under the hot Levantine sun of July and August the two parties
denounced one another on the one side for not accepting the condemnation of Nestorius,
which the Cyrillians had passed in the beginning of their proceedings, on the other for the
informality and injustice of the condemnation. Then deputies from the Orientals, of whom
Theodoret was one, hurried to Constantinople, but were allowed to proceed no further than
Chalcedon. The letters written by Theodoret at this time to his friends among the bishops
and at the court, and his petitions to the Emperor,52 leave a vivid impression of the zeal,
vigour and industry of the writer, as well as of the extraordinary literary readiness which
could pour out letter after letter, memorial after memorial, amid all the excitement of controversy,
the weariness of travel, the sojourning in strange and uncomfortable quarters, and
the tension of anxiety as to an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Though Nestorius was deposed his friends protested that they would continue true to
him, and Theodoret was one of the synod held at Tarsus, and of another at Antioch, in
which the protest against Cyril’s action was renewed. But the oriental bishops were now
themselves undergoing a process of scission,53 John of Antioch and Acacius of Beroea
heading the peacemakers who were anxious to come to terms with Cyril, while Alexander
of Hierapolis led the irreconcilables. Intellectually Theodoret shrank from concession, but
his moral instincts were all in favour of peace. He himself drew up a declaration of faith
which was presented by Paul of Emesa to Cyril, which Cyril accepted. But still true to his
friend, Theodoret refused to accept the deposition of Nestorius and his individual condem-

nation, and it was not till several years had elapsed that, moved less by the threat of exile
and forfeiture, as the imperial penalty for refusing to accept the position, than by the entreaties
of his beloved flock and of his favourite ascetic solitaries that he would not leave them,
Theodoret found means of attaching a meaning to the current anathemas on Nestorianism,
not, as he said, on Nestorius, which allowed him to submit. He even entered into friendly
correspondence with Cyril.54 But the truce was hollow. Cyril was indignant to find that
Theodoret still maintained his old opinions. At last the protracted quarrel was ended by
Cyril’s death in June, 444.</p>
<p>On the famous letter over which so many battles of criticism have been fought we have
already spoken. If it was really written by Theodoret, to which opinion my own view inclines,
55 there is no reason why we should damn it as “a coarse and ferocious invective.” If
genuine, it was clearly a piece of grim pleasantry dashed off in a moment of excitement to
a personal friend, and never intended for the publicity which has drawn such severe blame
upon its writer.</p>
<p>But though the death of Cyril might appear to bring relief to the Church and Empire
as well as to his individual opponents, it was by no means a ground of unmixed gratification
to Theodoret.56 Dioscorus, who succeeded to the Patriarchate of Alexandria, however
Theodoret in the language of conventional courtesy may speak of the new bishop’s humble
mindedness,57 inherited none of the good qualities of Cyril and most of his faults. Theodoret,
naturally viewed with suspicion and dislike as the friend and supporter of Nestorius, gave
additional ground for ill-will and hostility by action which brought him into individual
conflict with Dioscorus. He accepted the synodical letters issued at Constantinople at the
time of Proclus, and so seemed to lower the dignity of the apostolic sees of Antioch and
Alexandria;58 he also warmly resented the tyrannical treatment of his friend Irenæus, bishop
of Tyre.59 Irenæus had indeed in the earlier days of his banishment to Petra after his first
condemnation in 435 attacked Theodoret for not being thoroughly Nestorian, but Theodoret
was able to claim Irenæus as not objecting to the crucial term θεοτόκος,60 reasonably understood,
and accepted him as unquestionably orthodox. When therefore Dioscorus, the
Archimandrite Eutyches, and his godson the eunuch Chrysaphius attacked Domnus for
consecrating Irenæus to the Metropolitan see of Tyre, Theodoret indignantly protested and

counselled Domnus as to how he had best reply.61 But Dioscorus and his party had now
the ear, and guided the fingers, of the imperial weakling at Constantinople, and the deposition
of Irenæus (Feb. 17, 448) was followed after a year’s successful intrigues by the autograph
edict of Theodosius confining Theodoret within the limits of his own diocese as a vexatious
and turbulent busybody.</p>

<head>IV.—Under the Ban of Theodosius and of the Latrocinium.</head>
<p>Theodoret was at Antioch when Count Rufus brought him the edict. His friends would
have detained him, but he hurried away.62 On reaching Cyrus he wrote to his friend
Anatolius warmly protesting against the cruel and unjust action taken against him, and informing
the patrician that Euphronius, a military officer, had travelled hard on the track of
Rufus to ask for a written acknowledgment of the receipt of the edict of relegation.63 The
letters written at this crisis by the indignant pen of the maligned scholar and saint64 have a
peculiar value, at once biographical, literary, and theological. To Eusebius bishop of Ancyra
he sends an important catalogue of his works. To Dioscorus, the chief of the cabal against
him, he sends a summary of his views on the incarnation and the nature of our Lord, couched
in such terms as might perhaps in earlier days have shortened his great controversy with
Cyril. But the opponents of Theodoret were not in a mood to be moved by any formulation
of the terms of his faith. Dioscorus received the letter with insult, and publicly joined in the
shout of anathema which he permitted to be raised against his hated brother.65 The condemnation
of Eutyches by Flavian’s Constantinopolian Synod had roused the Eutychian party
to leave no stone unturned to secure its reversal and crush it and all who upheld it. Of the
latter Theodoret was the most prominent, the ablest and perhaps the holiest. Hence he was
the natural representative and personification of the doctrines that Dioscorus sought to
decry and degrade.66 The sixth Council of Ephesus of evil fame met in the Church of St.
Mary the Virgin on August 8, 449. Eutyches was acquitted. Flavian was condemned. Ibas
of Edessa, Domnus of Antioch, and Theodoret of Cyrus were deprived of their sees. The
disgraceful scenes of violence which marked every stage of this shameful ecclesiastical
gathering have been described again and again with the vivid detail67 rendered possible by

are aware that the authority of Councils is not always reconcileable with the asserted authority of the Bishop of
their favourite see. (“Even those councils which were oecumenical have nothing to boast of in regard to the
Fathers, taken individually, which compose them. They appear as the antagonist host in a battle, not as the</note>

<note type="footnote">shepherds of their people.” Hist. Sketches, p. 335.) And it must be conceded that so far as outward circumstances
went the Latrocinium was as good a council as any other. As is pointed out by Dean Milman, “It is difficult to
discover in what respect, either in the legality of its convocation or the number and dignity of the assembled
prelates, consists its inferiority to more received and honoured councils. Two imperial commissioners attended
to maintain order in the council and peace in the city. Dioscorus the patriarch of Alexandria by the Imperial
command assumed the presidency. The Bishops who formed the Synod of Constantinople were excluded as
parties in the transaction, but Flavianus took his place with the Metropolitans of Antioch and Jerusalem and no
less than three hundred and sixty bishops and ecclesiastics. Three ecclesiastics, Julian a bishop, Renatus a presbyter,
and Hilarius a deacon were to represent the bishop of Rome. The Abbot Barsumas (this was an innovation)
took his seat in the Council as a kind of representative of the monks.” Milman, Lat. Christ. Book II. Chap. iv.
The fact is that the great Councils of the Early Church are like the great men of the Early Church. Some have
authority and some have not. But their authority does not depend upon formal circumstances or outward position.
They have authority because the inspired common sense of the Church has seen and valued the truth and wisdom
of their utterances. Athanasius, Arius, Cyril, and Nestorius, were all great churchmen. Athanasius and Cyril
stand out against the background of centuries as champions of the faith. Arius and Nestorius are counted as
heretics. Character does not outweigh doctrine. Nestorius is unsound in the faith though he was an amiable and
virtuous man; Cyril is an authority of orthodoxy though his personal qualities were not saintly. Of all the
councils that according to Ammianus Marcellinus hamstrung the postal resources of the Empire, take Nicæa,
Tyre, and the two Ephesian councils of 431 and 449. Nicæa and the earlier Ephesian are accepted by the Church
Catholic. Tyre and the later Ephesian, though both were summoned at the will of princes and attended by a
large concourse of bishops, are rejected. Why? The earlier Ephesian in the disorder and violence of its proceedings
was as disgraceful as the Tyrian and the later Ephesian. The councils of Nicæa and of Ephesus, called the first
and the third oecumenical councils, are vindicated by the assent of the wisest of the Church. The dictum securus
judicat orbis terrarum here holds good, and is seen to be identical with the ultimate foundation of the great Aristotelian
definition “defined by reason, and as the wise man would define.” And such is also the practical outcome
of the statement of Article XXI, of the Church of England. cf. the striking passage of Augustine (Cont. Maximin.
Arian. ii. 14). “Sed nunc nec ego Nicænum, nec tu debes Ariminense, tanquam proejudicaturus, proferre consilium. Nec ego
hujus auctoritate, nec tu illius detineris. Scripturarum auctoritatibus, non quorumque propriis, sed utrisque communibus
testibus, res cum re, causa cum causa, ratio cum ratione concertet.” On the first four accepted oecumenical councils Dr.
Salmon (Infallibility of the Church, p. 287) remarks, “Gregory the Great says that he venerates these four as the four
Gospels, and describes them as the four square stones on which the structure of faith rests. Yet the hard struggle each of
these councils had to make and the number of years which the struggle lasted before its decrees obtained general acceptance,
show that they obtain their authority because of the truth which they declared and it was not because of their authority
that the decrees were recognised as true.”</note>

the exactitude of contemporary narrative, but, inasmuch as Theodoret was condemned in
his absence we are concerned here less with the manner in which his condemnation was
brought about than with the steps he took to protest against and to reverse it.</p>
<p>To the prisoner of Cyrus courier after courier would bring intelligence of the riots and
tricks of the council. At last came news of the crowning wrong. On the indictment of an
Antiochene presbyter named Pelagius, Theodoret was condemned as an enemy of God, a
disseminator of poison, a false teacher deserving to be burnt. In support of the accusation
was quoted the careful theological statement addressed by Theodoret to the monks in the
Euphratensis and the Osrhoene which appears as Letter CLI., as well as citations from his
works at large. Dioscorus described the absent defendant as a blasphemous enemy of God
and the Emperor whose life had been spent in damning souls. Theodoret was sentenced not
merely to deposition from his see but to degradation from the priesthood and to excommunication,
and his books were ordered to be burnt.68 So the great council ended with the
deposition of Flavian of Constantinople, Eusebius of Dorylæum, Daniel of Carræ, Irenæus
of Tyre, Aquilinus of Biblus, and Domnus of Antioch as well as of Theodoret.69 Eutyches
the heretic Archimandrite was restored and the brutal Dioscorus seemed master of
Christendom. One word of manly Latin had broken in on the supple suffrages of the servile
orientals, the “Contradicitur” of Hilarius the representative of the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>To that church, and to its illustrious bishop, Theodoret naturally turned in his hour of
need. He implored his friend Anatolius to get him permission to plead his own cause in
person in the West, or if not to let him retire to his old home at Nicerte.70 The latter alternative
was conceded. In this retreat he received many proofs of the affectionate regard of his
friends and offers of more practical help than his modest necessities demanded.71 Thence
products of his facile pen travelled far and wide. The whole series of letters written at this
period gives touching testimony to the gentle and forgiving spirit of the sorely tried bishop.
There is nothing of the bitterness and fierce anger which appear sometimes in the earlier
controversy with Cyril. He is refined, not soured, by adversity, and, though he never approached
nearer to canonization than the acquisition of the inferior title of Blessed, he appears
in these dark days as no unworthy specimen of the suffering saint.72 The chief interest of
these letters is in truth moral, spiritual and theological. This, however, has been obscured
by the ecclesiastical interest which has been given them by the unwarranted attempt to
represent Theodoret’s letter to Leo as an “appeal” to the see of Rome in the later and tech-

nical sense of the word. Whether St. Hilary of Arles ever did or did not give the lie to his
short life of strenuous protest against the growing aggrandizement of the see of Rome, there
is no doubt that before his death at the age of 41 in 449 his suffragans had been released by
Leo from allegiance to a Metropolitan disobedient to the Roman chair, and that Valentinian
had issued an edict confirming Leo’s claims and making the authority of the Bishop of Rome
supreme in the West.73 It would be useful to maintainers of the Roman supremacy if they
could adduce instances of any assertion or acceptance of similar authority in the East. So it
has been said that Theodoret appealed to the Pope.74 In a sense this is of course perfectly
true. Theodoret did appeal to the Pope. But the whole superstructure of papal supremacy,
so far as Theodoret is concerned, is really based upon a poor paronomasia. The bishop of
Cyrus “appealed” to the bishop of Rome as any bishop believing himself to lie under an
unjust sentence might appeal to any other bishop, and as Theodoret did appeal to other
bishops. It is quite true that the church of Rome had many claims to honour and regard, as
Theodoret himself felicitously and opportunely points out, and that the present occupant
of its throne was a man of unblemished orthodoxy and of commanding personal dignity.
But to recognise these facts is a long way from admitting that this very dignified see had
either de facto or de jure any coercive jurisdiction over the Metropolitans of Alexandria or
of Hierapolis, to the latter of whom Cyrus was subordinate. Theodoret himself quotes the
crucial passage in St. Matthew’s gospel75 apparently without any idea that the “Petra” means
all the successors of the “Petrus.”76 What Theodoret asked from Leo was not the sentence
of a superior but the sympathy and support of an influential brother. What made it so peculiarly
important that he should gain the ear and the approval of Leo was that Rome had been
wholly unconcerned in the intrigue which condemned him. He could have had no more
idea of papal authority in the later ultramontane sense than he could of the decrees of the
Vatican Council. Bound as he was to do his utmost to vindicate not so much his own position
and doctrinal soundness, as the truth now trampled on by the combined factions of Alexandria
and the court, he naturally turned to Leo as alike the most respected and most independent
bishop of his age.77</p>
<note type="footnote">73 Cf. Milman Lat. Christ. Book ii. Chap. iv; Const. Valentin. iii Aug. apud S. Leon. op. epist. xi.</note>
<note type="footnote">74 Garnerius, the Jesuit, in his dissertation on the life of Theodoret writes: “When Theodoret got news of his
deposition he determined to send envoys to the apostolic see, that is to the head of all the churches in the world,
to plead his cause before the righteous judgment seat of St. Leo,” and in his summary of his own chapter he says
“Theodoret appeals to the apostolic see.”</note>

<p>Leo, however, could do little or nothing to help him. Theodosius, completely under the
influence of Chrysaphius and Dioscorus, was quite satisfied as to the proper constitution
and equity of the Latrocinium.</p>
<note type="footnote">pealed to the holy see, and by the holy see both were cleared and restored to their ecclesiastical dignities.” It
would be difficult in the compass of so short a sentence to combine more statements so completely misleading.
To say that Chrysostom and Theodoret both appealed to the “holy see” is as much an anachronism as to say
that they appealed to the Court of the Vatican or to the Dome of St. Peter’s. In their day there was no holy see,
that is to say, κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν. All sees were holy sees, just as all bishops were styled your holiness. Rome, it is true,
was the only apostolical see in the West, but it was not the only apostolical see, and whatever official precedence
it could claim over Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, was due to its being the see of the old imperial capital,
a precedence expressly ordered at Chalcedon to be shared with the new Rome on the Bosphorus. As to the
“appeal,” we have seen what it meant in the case of Theodoret. It meant the same in the case of Chrysostom.
Cut to the quick at the cruel and brutal treatment of his friends after his banishment from Constantinople in
the summer of 404 he pleaded his cause in letters sent as well to Venerius of Milan and Chromatius of Aquileia
as to Innocent of Rome. Innocent very properly espoused his cause, declared his deposition void, and did his
best to move Honorius to move Arcadius to convoke a council. The cruel story of the long martyrdom of bitter
exile and the death in the lonely chapel at Comana is a terrible satire on the restoration to ecclesiastical dignities.
The unwary reader of “the historical sketch” might imagine the famous John of the mouth of gold brought back
in triumph to Constantinople by the authority of the pope in 404 as he had been by the enthusiasm of his flock
in 403, and Arcadius and Eudoxia cowering before the power of Holy Church like Henry IV. at Canossa in 1077.
The true picture of the three years of agony which preceded the old man’s passage to the better world in 407 is
a painful contrast to contemplate (Pallad. Dial. 1–3. Theodoret V. 34. Sozomen viii. 26, 27, 28.) Of Theodoret’s
restoration to “ecclesiastical dignity,” and Leo’s part in it, we shall see further on.</note>

<head>V.—Theodoret and Chalcedon.</head>
<p>Now, not for the last time in history, an important part was played by a horse. In July,
450, Theodosius, while hunting in the neighbourhood of his capital, was thrown from the
saddle into a stream, hurt his spine, and a few days afterwards died.78 With him died the
cause of Eutyches and of Chrysaphius. The eunuch was promptly executed, and at last a
Council was conceded to reconsider and rectify the crimes and blunders of the Latrocinium.79
But the Empress and her venerable husband did not wait for the Council to undo some of
the wrong done to Theodoret, and the large place he filled in the eyes and estimation of the
oriental world is shewn by the interest shewn at Constantinople in his behalf.80 The decree
of relegation appears to have been rescinded, and he was free to present himself at the synod.
On the first assembling of the five hundred bishops,81 under the presidency of the imperial
Commissioners,82 the minutes of the Latrocinium were read; the presence of Dioscorus was
protested against by the Roman representation as having dared to hold a synod unauthorized
by Rome; and the claim of Theodoret to sit and vote, allowed both by the imperial Commissioners
and by the westerns, since Leo83 had accepted him as an orthodox bishop, was
vehemently resisted by the Eutychians. He entered, but at first did not vote, and his enemies
at last succeeded in wringing from him a personal anathema not only of Nestorianism, but
of Nestorius. The scenes reported in detail are too characteristic alike of the earlier Councils
and of Theodoret to be omitted.</p>
<p>“The illustrious Presidents and the honorable Assessors ordered that the most religious
bishop Theodoret should enter, that he might be a partaker of the Council, because the holy
Archbishop Leo had restored the bishopric to him; and the most sacred and pious Emperor
determined that he was to be present at the Holy Council. And on the entrance of the most

shouted out: ‘We had to sign a blank paper; we were scourged, and so we signed. Cast out
the Manichæans; cast out the enemies of Flavian; cast out the enemies of the faith.’ Dioscorus,
the most religious bishop of Alexandria said: ‘Why is Cyril being cast out, who is anathematized
by Theodoret?’ The Eastern and Pontic and Asian and Thracian most religious bishops
shouted out: ‘Cast out Dioscorus the murderer. Who does not know the deeds of Dioscorus?’
The Egyptian and the Illyrian and the Palestinian most religious bishops shouted out: ‘Long
years to the Empress!’ The Eastern and the most religious bishops with them shouted out:
‘Cast out the murderers!’ The Egyptians and the most religious bishops with them shouted
out: ‘The Empress has cast out Nestorius. Long years to the orthodox Empress! The Council
will not receive Theodoret.’ Theodoret, the most religious bishop, came up into the midst
and said: ‘I have offered petitions to the most godlike, most religious and Christ-loving
masters of the world, and I have related the disasters which have befallen me, and I claim
that they shall be read.’ The most illustrious Presidents and the most honourable Assessors
said: ‘Theodoret, the most religious bishop, having received his proper place from the holy
Archbishop of the renowned Rome, now occupies the place of an accuser. Wherefore, that
there be no confusion in our proceedings, allow the things which have had a beginning to
be finished. No prejudice will accrue to anyone from the appearance of the most religious
Theodoret. Every argument for you and for him, if you desire to make one on one side or
the other is of course reserved.’ And after Theodoret, the most religious bishop, had sat
down in the midst, the Eastern, and the most religious bishops who were with them, shouted
out: ‘He is worthy! He is worthy!’ The Egyptians and the most religious bishops who were
with them shouted out: ‘Do not call him a bishop! He is not a bishop! Cast out the fighter
against God! Cast out the Jew!’ The Easterns and the most religious bishops who were with
them shouted out: ‘The orthodox for the Council! Cast out the rebels! Cast out the murderers!’
The Egyptians and the most religious bishops who were with them shouted out: ‘Cast
out the fighter against God! Cast out the insulter of Christ! Long years to the Empress! Long
years to the Emperor! Long years to the orthodox Emperor! Theodoret has anathematized
Cyril.’ The Easterns and the most religious bishops who were with them shouted out: ‘Cast
out the murderer Dioscorus!’ The Egyptians and the most religious bishops with them
shouted out: ‘Long years to the Assessors! He has not the right of speech. He is expelled
from the whole Synod!’ Basil, the most religious bishop of Trajanopolis, in the province of
Rhodope, rose up and said: ‘Theodoret has been condemned by us.’ The Egyptians and the
most religious bishops with them shouted out: ‘Theodoret has accused Cyril. We cast out
Cyril if we receive Theodoret. The Canons cast out Theodoret. God has turned away from
him.’ The most illustrious Presidents and the most honourable Assessors said: ‘The vulgar
cries are not worthy of bishops, nor will they assist either side. Suffer, therefore, the reading
of all the documents.’ The Egyptians and the most religious bishops with them shouted out:

<pb n="33"/>
‘Cast out one man, and we will all hear. We shout out in the cause of Religion. We say these
things for the sake of the orthodox Faith.’ The most illustrious Presidents and the honourable
Assessors said: ‘Rather acquiesce, in God’s name, that the hearing of the documents should
take place, and concede that all shall be read in proper order.’ And at last they were silent,
and Constantine, the most holy Secretary and Magistrate of the Divine Synod, read these
documents.”84</p>
<p>One more sad incident must be given—the demand made at the eighth session that
Theodoret should pronounce a curse on his ancient friend. “The most reverend bishops all
stood before the rails of the most holy altar, and shouted “Theodoret must now anathematize
Nestorius.” Theodoret, the most reverend bishop, passed into the midst, and said: “I have
made my petition to the most divine and religious Emperor, and I have laid documents
before the most reverend bishops occupying the place of the most sacred Archbishop Leo;
and if you think fit, they shall be read to you, and you will know what I think.’ The most
reverend bishops shouted ‘We want nothing to be read—only anathematize Nestorius.’
Theodoret, the most reverend bishop, said: ‘I was brought up by the orthodox, I was taught
by the orthodox, I have preached orthodoxy, and not only Nestorius and Eutyches, but any
man who thinks not rightly, I avoid and count him an alien.’ The most reverend bishops
shouted out: ‘Speak plainly; anathema to Nestorius and his doctrine—anathema to
Nestorius and to those who defend him.’ Theodoret, the most reverend bishop said: ‘Of a
truth I say nothing except so far as I know it to be pleasing to God. First I will convince you
that I am here, not because I care for my city, not because I covet rank. Because I have been
falsely accused, I come to satisfy you that I am orthodox, and that I anathematize Nestorius
and Eutyches, and every one who says that there are two Sons.’ Whilst he was speaking, the
most reverend bishops shouted out: ‘Speak plainly; anathematize Nestorius and those who
think with him.’ Theodoret, the most reverend bishop, said: ‘Unless I set forth at length my
faith I cannot speak. I believe’—And whilst he spoke the most reverend bishops shouted:
‘He is a heretic! He is a Nestorian! Away with the heretic! Anathema to Nestorius and to
any one who does not confess that the Holy Virgin Mary is the Parent of God, and who divides
the only begotten Son to two Sons.’ Theodoret, the most reverend bishop, said, ‘Anathema
to Nestorius and to whoever denies that the Holy Virgin Mary is the Parent of God,
and who divides the only begotten Son into two Sons. I have subscribed the definition of
faith, and the epistle of the most holy Archbishop Leo.”85</p>

<head>VI.—Retirement after Chalcedon, and Death.</head>
<p>Some doubt hangs over the question whether after his vindication at Chalcedon
Theodoret resumed his labours at Cyrus, or occupied himself with literary work in the
congenial seclusion of Nicerte. Garnerius makes it about the time of his quitting Chalcedon
that Sporacius charged him with the duty of writing on the Heresies,86 and if so his five
books on this subject would seem to have constituted the first fruit of his comparative leisure.
Sporacius87 he styles his “Christ-loving Son,” and no doubt owed something to the aid of
the influential “Comes domesticorum,” who was present at Chalcedon, when the question
of his admission to the Council was being agitated. To this period has also been referred his
commentary on the Octateuch.88 On Dr. Newman’s statement that Theodoret made over
the charge of his diocese to Hypatius (one of his chorepiscopi, who had been entrusted with
his appeal to Pope Leo) and retired into his monastery, and there regaining the peace which
he had enjoyed in youth, passed from the peace of the Church to the peace of eternity,
Canon Venables89 remarks that there is no authority for so pleasing a picture, and that
Tillemont90 contradicts it altogether. Garnerius quotes his congratulation to Sabinianus91
on leaving Perrha as suggestive of what conduct he might have preferred.</p>
<p>It is at least certain that during this period he received a long and sympathetic letter
from Leo, from which it is clear that the Roman bishop reposed great confidence in him.92
It is characteristic of one in whom the mere man was merged in the theologian and ecclesiastic
that, as of the year of his birth, so of the year of his death, we have no specific information,
and are compelled to form our conclusions on evidence which though valuable, is
not overwhelming. Theodorus Lector, the composer of the Historia Tripartita, in the 6th
century, states93 that Theodoret prepared a sepulchral urn for the burial of the famous as-

to write to Theodoret, par parenthèse, of the Roman See as one “quam coeteris omnium Dominus statuit proesidere.”
If in “statuit” Leo had meant to refer to a Divine Providence overruling history, and in “proesidere” to the fact
that Rome was for many years the capital of the world, his remark would have been open to little objection. But

mentions Jacobus Syrus as still living when the Emperor Leo sent his Circular Letter to the
bishops in 458, though then he must have been in extreme old age. And Gennadius, who
lived not long after Theodoret, says that he died in the reign of Leo. The evidence is not
strong. Theodoret may have died some years before Jacob. But Gennadius probably knew.
On the whole we may conclude that there is some probability that Theodoret survived till
458; none that he lived longer. Like Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland, to whom, in his isolation,
Dean Stanley96 compares him, Theodoret must have expired with the cry of “Peace, Peace,”
in his heart, if not on his lips. Garnerius is careful to prove that he died in “the peace of the
Church,” and appeals in support of this contention to the laudatory testimony of Popes
Vigilius, Pelagius I., Pelagius II., and Gregory the Great. The peace of the Church, in the
narrower sense, has not always been accorded to holy men and women who have assuredly
departed this life in the faith and fear of their Lord. In its truer and holier connotation it
coincides with a state in which we trust we may contemplate the godly old man of Cyrus,
forgetting the storms that had beaten now and again on the life he was leaving behind him,
and stepping quietly into the calm of the windless haven of souls,—the Peace not of man,
but of God.</p>

<head>VII.—The Condemnation of “the Three Chapters.”</head>
<p>A sketch of the life of Theodoret might well be supposed to terminate with his death.
But it can hardly be regarded as complete without a brief supplementary notice of the
posthumous controversy which has contributed to his fame in ecclesiastical history. The
Council of Chalcedon was designed to give rest to the Church, and to undo a great wrong,
and catholic common sense has since vindicated its decisions. But it was not to be supposed
that the opinions and passions which had achieved a combined triumph at Ephesus in 449
would die away and disappear in consequence of the imperial and synodical action of 451.
The face of the world was changing. The vandal Genseric captured and pillaged Rome. The
Teutonic races were pushing to a foremost place, and accepting first of all an Arian Christianity.
Clovis represented orthodoxy almost alone. Theodoric, the Arian Ostrogoth, mastered
Italy. Then the turning tide saw Rome once again a city of sole empire, but not the chief
city. The victories of Belisarius made of Rome a suburb of Constantinople, and empire and
theology swayed and were swayed by the policy of Justinian and the palace plots of Theodora.
All through monophysitism had had its friends and defenders. Metropolitans, monks, and
mobs had anathematized one another for nearly a century. At Alexandria Dioscorus had
won almost a local canonization, and the patriarch Timotheus, nicknamed “the Cat,” had
left a strong monophysite party, consolidated under Peter the Stutterer as the “acephali.”97
At Antioch Peter the Fuller had anathematized all who refused to accept the Shibboleth he
appended to the Trisagion, “who wast crucified on our account.” Leo, Marcian’s successor
on the Eastern throne, had followed Marcian’s theology, and Zeno, Leo; but the usurper
Basiliscus had seen elements of strength in a bold bid for monophysite support. Zeno, on
the fall of Basiliscus, had attempted to atone the disunited sections of Christendom by the
henoticon, or edict of unity, but the henoticon had been for years a watchword of division.
Anastasius had favoured the Eutychians. And in his reign Theodoret had been twice condemned,
at the synods of Constantinople and Sidon, in 499 and 512.98</p>
<p>Justin I., the unlettered barbarian, supported the Chalcedonians, but in 544 Belisarius
had made the Eutychian Vigilius bishop of Rome. When Justinian aspired to become a
second Constantine, and give theological as well as civil law to the world, it was proposed
to condemn in a fifth oecumenical council certain so-called Nestorian writings, on the plea
that such a condemnation might reconcile the opponents of Chalcedon. The writings in
question were the Letter of Ibas of Edessa to Maris, praising Theodore of Mopsuestia; the
works of Theodore himself, and the writings of Theodoret against Cyril. These three literary

<pb n="37"/>
monuments were known as “the Three Chapters.”99 Of the controversy of the Three Chapters
it has been said that it “filled more volumes than it was worth lines.”100 The Council satisfied
nobody. Pope Vigilius, detained at Constantinople and Marmora with something of the
same violence with which Napoleon I. detained Pius VI. at Valence, declined to preside over
a gathering so exclusively oriental. The West was outraged by the constitution of the synod,
irrespective of its decisions. The Monophysites were disappointed that the credit of Chalcedon
should be even nominally saved by the nice distinction which damaged the writings, but
professed complete agreement with the council which had refused to damn the writers. The
orthodox wanted no slur cast upon Chalcedon, and, however fenced, the condemnation of
the Three Chapters indubitably involved such a slur. Practically, the decrees of the fourth
and fifth councils are mutually inconsistent, and it is impossible to accept both. Theodoret
was reinstated at Chalcedon in spite of what he had written, and what he had written was
anathematized at Constantinople in spite of his reinstatement.</p>
<p>The xiii Canon of the fifth Council runs as follows, “if any one defends the impious
writings of Theodoret which he published against the true faith, against the first holy synod
of Ephesus and against the holy Cyril and his twelve chapters; and all that he wrote in defence
of the impious Theodorus and Nestorius, and others who held the same opinions as the
aforesaid Theodorus and Nestorius, defending them and their impiety, and accordingly
calling impious the doctors of the church who confess the union according to hypostasis of
God the Word in the flesh; and does not anathematize these writings and those who have
held or do hold similar opinions, above all those who have written against the true faith and
the holy Cyril and his twelve chapters, and have remained to the day of their death in such
impiety; let him be anathema.”</p>
<p>In this condemnation the works certainly included are Theodoret’s “Objections to Cyril’s
Chapters,” some of his letters, and, among his lost works, the “Pentalogium,” namely five
books on the Incarnation written against Cyril and his supporters at Ephesus, of which
<note type="footnote">99 Dean Milman (Lat. Christ. iv, 4), following in the wake of Gibbon, remarks that “the church was not now
disturbed by the sublime, if inexplicable, dogmas concerning the nature of God, the Persons of the Trinity, or
the union of the divine and human nature of Christ, concerning the revelations of Scripture, or even the opinions
of the ancient fathers. The orthodoxy or heterodoxy of certain writings by bishops but recently dead became
the subject of imperial edicts of a fifth so-called OEcumenic Council, held at Constantinople, and a religious war
between the East and the West,” but it was on their explanation of sublime if inexplicable dogmas that the orthodoxy
or heterodoxy of these bishops depended, and so far as the subject matter of dispute is concerned, the
position in 553 was not very different from that of 451. In both cases the church was moved at once by honest
conviction and partisan passion; the state was influenced partly by a healthy desire to promote peace through
out the empire, partly by the meaner ambition of posing as theological arbitrator.</note>

<pb n="38"/>
fragments are preserved, and two allocutions against Cyril delivered at Chalcedon in 431,
of which portions exist in the acts of the fifth Council, and do not exhibit Theodoret at his
best.</p>
<p>The Council has at least preserved to us an interesting little record of the survival at
Cyrus of the memory of her great bishop, for it appears that at the seventh collation, held
at the end of May, notice was taken of an enquiry ordered by Justinian respecting a statue
or portrait of Theodoret which was said to have been carried in procession into his cathedral
town, by Andronicus a presbyter and George a deacon.101 A more important tribute to his
memory is the fact that, though it officially anathematized writings some of which, composed
in the thick of the fight, and soiled with its indecorous dust, Theodoret himself may well
have regretted and condemned, the Council advisedly abstained from directly condemning
a bishop whose character and person were protected by the notorious iniquity of the robber
council that had deposed him, the friendship of the illustrious Leo, and the solemn vindication
of the church in Synod at Chalcedon, as well as by his own confession of the faith, his
repudiation of the errors of Nestorius, and the stainless beauty and pious close of his long
life.</p>
<p>No better reconciliation between Chalcedon and Constantinople can be proffered than
that which Garnerius quotes from the letter said to have been written by Gregory the Great,
though sent in the name of Pelagius II, to the Illyrians on the fifth council, “It is the part of
unwarrantable rashness to defend those writings of Theodoret which it is notorious that
Theodoret himself condemned in his subsequent profession of the right faith. So long as
we at once accept himself and repudiate the erroneous writings which have long remained
unknown we do not depart in any way from the decision of the sacred synod, because so
long as we only reject his heretical writings, we, with the synod, attack Nestorius, and with
the synod express our veneration for Theodoret in his right confession. His other writings
we not only accept, but use against our foes.”102</p>

<head>VIII.—The Works of Theodoret.</head>
<p>Of authorities for the works of Theodoret we may first cite himself. In four of his letters
he mentions his own writings; viz.: in lxxxii, to Eusebius of Ancyra; in cxiii, to Leo of Rome;
in cxvi, to the Presbyter Renatus; and in cxlv, to the monks at Constantinople. Of these the
first was written in 445 and the last three in 449 and a reference to them will show the works
mentioned. It is to be noticed103 that no allusion is made to the refutation of the twelve
chapters; to the defence of Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodorus of Mopsuestia, nor to the
Dialogues, though all are held to have been written before the Latrocinium. It may have
been, as Garnerius conjectures, that Theodoret did not judge it politic at this time to call
attention to these particular works, but the assumption is not based on strong grounds, and
Theodoret never appears as one unwilling to avow his convictions, which indeed, were
perfectly well known.</p>
<p>Gennadius, presbyter of Marseilles, who died in 496, writes “Theodoretus, bishop of
Cyrus, is said to have written many works: those, however, which have come to my knowledge
are the following; of the Incarnation of the Lord, against the presbyter Eutyches, and Dioscorus,
bishop of Alexandria, who deny that there was in Christ human flesh,—powerful
writings wherein he proves, as well by argument as by scriptural evidence, that Christ had
very flesh of the substance of His mother, which He took from the Virgin, and very Godhead,
which by eternal generation He received, in being generated, from God the father begetting
Him. There exist also his books of Ecclesiastical History, which he wrote in imitation of
Eusebius of Cæsarea, beginning from the end of the books of Eusebius down to his own
time, viz.: from the twentieth year of Constantine down to the reign of Leo I, in whose reign
he died.”104</p>
<p>Photius, in the ninth century, says that he has read the Ecclesiastical History; twentyseven
books against Heresies, among which he reckons the “Eranistes;” five books
“Hæreticarum Fabularum;” five in praise of Chrysostom; with Commentaries on Daniel,
the Octateuch, Kings, Chronicles, and the Twelve Minor Prophets.</p>
<p>Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopulus in the fourteenth century, Hist. Ecc. xiv. 54, writes:
“Theodoretus, Syrian by birth, was a follower of the great Chrysostom, whom he set before
him as a model of style. His own was flowing and copious, eloquent and easy, and not destitute
of Attic grace.” He mentions expositions of difficult passages of the Old Testament;
Commentaries on the Prophets and the Psalms; the “de Providentia;” a volume “On the
Apostles;” the Confutation of heresies, called “the battle between truth and falsehood;” the

<head>IX.—Contents and Character of the Extant Works.</head>
<p>(a) The character of the Commentary on the Octateuch and the Books of Kings and
Chronicles is indicated by the Title “εἰς τὰ ᾽άπορα τῆς θείας Γραφῆς κατ᾽ ᾽εκλογήν,” or “On
selected difficulties in Holy Scripture.” These questions are treated, with occasional deflexions
into allegory, from the historico-exegetical point of view of the Syrian School,107 of which
Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia were distinguished representatives. On
Diodorus Socrates108 remarks, “he composed many works, relying on the bare letter of
Scripture, and avoiding their speculative aspect.” This might be said of Diodorus’ great pupil
too. Nevertheless, though generally following a line of interpretation in broad contrast with
that of Origen, Theodoret quotes Origen as well as Diodore and Theodore of Mopsuestia
as authorities. Of the 182 “questions” on Genesis and Exodus the following may be taken
as specimens.</p>
<p>Question viii. “What spirit moved upon the waters?” Theodoret’s conclusion is that the
wind is indicated.</p>
<p>Question x. “Why did the author add, ‘And God saw that it was good’?” To persuade
the thankless not to find fault with what the divine judgment pronounces good.</p>
<p>Question xix. “To whom did God say ‘let us make man in our image and likeness’?”
The reply, carefully elaborated, is that here is an indication of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Question xx. “What is meant by ‘image’?”</p>
<p>Here long extracts from Diodorus, Theodorus, and Origen are given.</p>
<p>Question xxiv. “Why did God plant paradise, when He intended straightway to drive
out Adam thence?”</p>
<p>God condemns none of foreknowledge. And besides, He wished to shew the saints the
Kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world.109</p>
<p>Question xl. “What is the meaning of the statement ‘The man is become as one of us’?”
Theodoret thinks this is said ironically. God had forbidden Adam to take of the fruit of the
tree of life, not because he grudged man immortal life, but to check the course of sin. So
death is a means of cure, not a punishment.</p>
<p>Question xlvii. “Whom did Moses call sons of God?” A long argument replies, the sons
of Seth.</p>
<p>Question lxxxi suggests an ingenious excuse for Jacob. “Did not Jacob lie when he said,
I am Esau thy firstborn?” He had bought the precedence of primogeniture, and therefore
spoke the truth when he called himself firstborn.</p>

<p>Exodus. “Question xii. What is the meaning of the phrase ‘I will harden Pharaoh’s
heart’?” This is answered at great length.</p>
<p>The information given in these notes, as we might call them, is theological, exegetic,
and explanatory of peculiar terms, and is often of interest and value. On the fourteen Books
of Questions and Answers Canon Venables,110 quoting Ceillier, remarks that the whole
form a literary and historical commentary of great service for the right comprehension of
the text, characterized by honesty and common sense, and seldom straining or evading the
meaning to avoid dangerous conclusions.</p>
<p>(b) On the Psalms and the rest of the Books of the Old Testament the Commentary is
no longer in the catechetical form, but is styled Interpretation.111</p>
<p>The Psalmist, Theodoret observes,112 in many places predicts the passion and resurrection
of our Lord, and to attentive readers causes real delight by the variety of his prophesying.
In view of some recent discussions concerning the authorship of certain Psalms it is interesting
to find the enthusiast for orthodoxy in the 5th century writing “It has been contended
by some critics that the Psalms are not all the work of David, but are to be ascribed in some
cases to other writers. Accordingly, from the titles, some have been attributed to Idithum,
some to Etham, some to the sons of Core, some to Asaph, by men who have learned from
the Chronicles that these writers were prophets.113 On this point I make no positive statement.
What difference indeed does it make to me whether all the Psalms are David’s, or
some were the composition of others, when it is clear that all were written by the active operation
of the Holy Spirit?”</p>
<p>The importance of the commentary on the Psalms may be estimated by the fact that it
is longer than all the catechetical commentary on the preceding Books combined.</p>
<p>The interpretation on the Canticles follows spiritual, as distinguished from literal, lines.
The lover is Jesus Christ;—the bride, the Church. From the prologue it appears that Theodoret
held all the Old Testament to have been re-written, under divine inspiration, by Ezra. This
is regarded as the earliest of the exegetical works.</p>
<p>The original commentary on Isaiah has been lost. The only existing portions are passages
collected from the Greek catenæ by Sirmond and edited in his edition, but the opinion has
been entertained114 that these passages should be referred to Theodore of Mopsuestia who
also commented on Isaiah, and who is sometimes confused with Theodoret by the compilers
of the Greek catenæ.</p>

<p>The commentary on Jeremiah includes Baruch and the Lamentations.115</p>
<p>(c) The epistles of St. Paul, among which Theodoret reckons the Epistle to the Hebrews,
are the only portions of the New Testament on which we possess our author’s commentaries.
On them the late Bishop Lightfoot writes, “Theodoret’s commentaries on St. Paul are superior
to his other exegetical writings, and have been assigned the palm over all patristic expositions
of Scripture. See Schröckh xviii. p. 398. sqq., Simon, p. 314 sqq. Rosenmüller iv. p. 93
sqq., and the monograph of Richter, de Theodoreto Epist. Paulin, interprete (Lips. 1822.)
For appreciation, terseness of expression and good sense, they are perhaps unsurpassed,
and, if the absence of faults were a just standard of merit, they would deserve the first place;
but they have little claim to originality, and he who has read Chrysostom and Theodore of
Mopsuestia will find scarcely anything in Theodoret which he has not seen before. It is right
to add however that Theodoret modestly disclaims any such merit. In his preface he apologises
for attempting to interpret St. Paul after two such men who are ‘luminaries of the
world:’ and he professes nothing more than to gather his stores ‘from the blessed fathers.’
In these expressions he alludes doubtless to Chrysostom and Theodore.”116</p>
<p>As a specimen of the mode of treatment of a crucial passage, of interest in view of the
writer’s relations to the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies, the notes on I. Cor. xv. 27,
28 may be quoted. “This is a passage which Arians and Eunomians have been wont to be
constantly adducing with the notion that they are thereby belittling the dignity of the onlybegotten.
They ought to have perceived that the divine apostle has written nothing in this
passage about the Godhead of the only-begotten. He is exhorting us to believe in the resurrection
of the flesh, and endeavours to prove the resurrection of the flesh by the resurrection
of the Lord. It is obvious that like is conformed to like. On this account he calls Him ‘the
first fruits of them that have fallen asleep,’ and styles Him ‘Man,’ and by comparison with
Adam proves that by Him the general resurrection will come to pass, with the object of
persuading objectors, by shewing the resurrection of one of like nature, to believe that all
mankind will share His resurrection. It must therefore be recognised that the natures of the
Lord are two: and that divine Scripture names Him sometimes from the human, and
sometimes from the divine. If it speaks of God, it does not deny the manhood: if it mentions
man it at the same time confesses the Godhead. It is impossible always to speak of Him in
terms of sublimity, on account of the nature which He received from us, for if even when
lowly terms are employed some men deny the assumption of the flesh, clearly still more
would have been found infected with this unsoundness, had no lowly terms been used. What
then is the meaning of ‘then is subjected’? This expression is applicable to sovereigns exercising
sovereignty now, for if He then is subjected He is not yet subjected. So they are all in

<pb n="45"/>
error who blaspheme and try to make subject Him who has not yet submitted to the limits
of subjection. We must wait, and learn the mode of the subjection. But we have gone through
long discussions on these points in our contests with them. It is enough now to indicate
briefly the Apostle’s aim. He is writing to the Corinthians who have only just been set free
from the fables of heathendom. Their fables are full of violence and iniquity. Not to name
others, and pollute my lips, they worship parricide gods, and say that sons revolted against
their fathers, drove them from their realm, and seized their sovereignty. So after saying great
things of Christ, in that He shall destroy all rule and authority and power, and shall put an
end to death, and hath subdued all things under his feet; lest starting from those fables of
theirs they should expect Him to treat His father like the Dæmons whom they adore; after
mentioning, as was necessary, the subjugation of all things the apostle adds ‘The Son Himself
shall be subject to Him that did put all things under Him.’ For not only shall He not subject
the Father to Himself, but shall Himself accept the subjection becoming to a son. So the divine
apostle, suspecting the mischief arising from the pagan mythology, uses expressions of
lowliness because such terms are helpful. But let objectors tell us the form of that subjection.
If they are willing to consider the truth, He shewed obedience when He was made man, and
wrought out our salvation. How then shall He then be subjected, and how shall He then
deliver the kingdom to God the Father? If the case be viewed in this way, it will appear that
God the Father does not hold the kingdom now. So full of absurdity are their arguments.
But He makes what is ours His own, since we are called His body, and He is called our Head.
‘He took our iniquities and bore our diseases.’117 So He says in the Psalm ‘my God, my God,
look upon me, why hast Thou forsaken me. The words of my transgressions are far from
my health.’118 And yet He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. But a mouth
is made of our nature, in that He was made the first fruits of the nature. So He appropriates
our frequent disobedience and the then subjection, and, when we are subjected after our
delivery from corruption He is said to be subjected. What follows leads us on to this sense.
For after the words ‘then shall the son be subject to Him that did put all things under Him,’
the Apostle adds ‘that God may be all in all.’ He is everywhere now in accordance with His
essence, for His nature is uncircumscribed, as says the divine apostle, ‘in Him we live and
move and have our being.’119 But, as regards His good pleasure, He is not in all, for ‘the
Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in his mercy.’120 But in these
He is not wholly. For no one is pure of uncleanness, and In thy sight shall no man living be
justified121 and ‘If thou Lord shouldst mark iniquities O Lord who shall stand?’ Therefore

the Lord taketh pleasure wherein they do right and taketh not pleasure wherein they err.
But in the life to come where corruption ceases and immortality is given passions have no
place; and after these have been quite driven out no kind of sin is committed for the future.
Thus hereafter God shall be all in all, when all have been released from sin and turned to
Him and are incapable of any inclination to the worse. And what in this place the divine
Apostle has said of God in another passage he has laid down of Christ. His words are these.
‘Where there is neither Jew nor Greek, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian,
Scythian<gap reason="omitted"/>but Christ is all and in all.’122 He would not have applied to the Son what is attributable
to the Father had he not of divine grace learnt that He is of equal honour with
Him.’123</p>
<p>On the meaning of the passage about them that are baptized for the dead it is curious
to find only one interpretation curtly proffered in apparent unconsciousness of any other
being known or possible. Theodoret’s words are “He, says the apostle, who is baptized is
buried with the Lord, that as he has been sharer in the death so he may be sharer in the resurrection.
But if the body is dead and does not rise why then is he baptized?” The dead for
which a man is baptized seems to be regarded as his own dead body i.e., dead in trespasses
and sin and subject to corruption.124</p>

spective; a fulness of detail is sometimes conceded to mere episode and parenthesis, while
characters and events of high and crucial importance would scarcely be known to be so,
were we dependent for our estimation of them on Theodoret alone. Valesius inclines to the
opinion that his opening words about supplying things omitted128 refer to Socrates and
Sozomen, and compares him in his composition of a history after those writers (there is just
a possibility that he might have completed the parallel by referring to a third predecessor—
Rufinus) to St. John filling up the gaps left by the synoptists.129 But this view is
open to question. Theodoret names no previous writers but Eusebius. A special importance
attaches to his account of such events and persons as his local knowledge enables him to
give with completeness of detail, as for instance, all that relates to Antioch and its bishops.
Garnerius is of opinion that the work might with propriety be entitled A History of the
Arian Heresy; all other matter introduced he views as merely episodic.130 He also quotes
the letter131 of Gregory the great in which the Roman bishop states that “the apostolic see
refuses to receive the History of ‘Sozomenus’ (sic) inasmuch as it abounds with lies, and
praises Theodore of Mopsuestia, maintaining that he was up to the day of his death, a great
Doctor.” “Sozomen” is supposed to be a slip of the pen, or of the memory, for “Theodoret.”
But, if this be so, “multa mentitur” is an unfair description of the errors of the historian.
Fallible he was, and exhibits failure in accuracy, especially in chronology, but his truthfulness
of aim is plain.132</p>

Theodoret, a disciple of the “prosaic and critical” school of Antioch, accepts and repeats
marvellous tales of the miracles of his contemporary hermits, has been invested with fresh
interest in our own time by the apparent sympathy and similar belief of Dr. Newman, who
asks “What made him drink in with such relish what we reject with such disgust? Was it
that, at least, some miracles were brought home so absolutely to his sensible experience that
he had no reason for doubting the others which came to him second-hand? This certainly
will explain what to most of us is sure to seem the stupid credulity of so well-read, so intellectual
an author.”134 Cardinal Newman evidently implies that the evidence was irresistible,
even to a keen and trained intelligence. Probably in many cases the explanation is to be
found, as has been already suggested in the remarks on Theodoret’s birth, in the ready acceptance
of the current views of the age and place as to cause and effect. Theodoret believed
in the marvels of his monks. Matthew Hale believed in witchcraft. Neither, that is, was some
centuries removed from his own age. Neither need be accused of stupid credulity. The enthusiasm
which led him to reckon on finding the noble army of martyrs a very present help
in time of trouble because he had a little bottle of their oil, probably that burned at their
graves, slung over his bed; and his assurance that the old cloak of Jacobus, folded for his
pillow, was a more than adamantine bulwark against the wiles of the devil, indicate no more
than an exaggerated reliance on the power of material memorials to affect the imagination.135
And it is curious to remark that with all this acceptance of the cures effected by ascetics,
Theodoret made a provision of medical skill for his flock at Cyrus.136</p>
<p>(e) The works reckoned as theological, as distinct from the controversial, are three: (i)
The twelve discourses entitled ῾Ελληνικῶν θεραπευτικὴ παθημάτων, or “Græcarum affectionum
curatio, seu evangelicæ veritatis ex gentilium philospohia cognitio.’ They contain an
elaborate apology for Christian philosophy, with a refutation of the attacks of paganism
against the doctrines of the gospel, and may have been designed, as Garnerius conjectures,
to serve as an antidote against whatever might still survive of the influence of Julian and his
writings. Here we see at once our author’s “genius and erudition” (Mosheim). In these
orations he exhibits a wide acquaintance with Greek literature, and we find cited, or referred
to, among other writers, Homer, Hesiod, Alcman, Theognis, Xenophanes, Pindar, Heraclitus,
Zeno, Parmenides, Empedocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,
Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Porphyry. Homer and Plato are largely quoted.
Basnage,137 indeed, contested their genuineness, but without weakening their position
among Theodoret’s accepted works. They have seemed to some to encourage undue honour

to and invocation of saints and martyrs138 but their author seems to anticipate later exaggeration
of their reverence by the distinction, “We ascribe Godhead to nothing visible. Them
that have been distinguished in virtue we honour as excellent men, but we worship none
but the God and Father of all, His Word, and the Holy Spirit.”139 (ii). The Discourses against
paganism were followed by ten on Divine Providence, a work justly eulogized as exhibiting
Theodoret’s literary power in its highest form. Of it Garnerius, who is by no means disposed
to bestow indiscriminate laudation on the writer, remarks that nothing was ever published
on this subject more eloquent or more admirable, either by Theodoret, or by any other.140
The discourses may not improbably have been delivered in public at Antioch, and have
been the occasion of the enthusiastic admiration described as shewn by the patriarch John.141
In them he presses the argument of the divine guidance of the world from the constitution
of the visible creation, and specially of the body of man. The preacher draws many illustrations
from the animal world and shews himself to be an intelligent observer. The pursuit of
righteousness is proved not to be vain, even though the achieved result is not seen until the
resurrection, and it is argued that from the beginning God has not cared for one chosen
race alone but for all mankind. The crowning evidence of divine providence is in the incarnation.
“I have taught you”—so the great orations conclude—“the universal providence of
God. You behold His unfathomable loving kindness;—His boundless mercy; cease then to
strive against Him that made you; learn to do honour to your benefactor, and requite his
mighty benefits with grateful utterance. Offer to God the sacrifice of praise; defile not your
tongue with blasphemy, but make it the instrument of worship for which it was designed.
Such divine dispensations as are plain, reverence; about such as are hidden make no ado,
but wait for knowledge in the time to come. When we shall put off the senses, then we shall
win perfect knowledge. Imitate not Adam who dared to pluck the forbidden fruit; lay not
hold of hidden things, but leave the knowledge of them to their own fit season. Obey the
words of the wise man—say not What is this? For what purpose is this! ‘For all things were
made for good.’142 Gathering then from every source occasion for praise, and mingling one
melody, offer it with me to the Creator, the giver of good, and Christ the Saviour, our very
God. To them be glory and worship and honour for endless age on age. Amen.”</p>

<p>(iii) The Discourse on Divine Love. This love, says Theodoret, is the source of the holy
life of the ascetics. For his own part he would not accept the kingdom of heaven without it,
or with it, were such a thing possible, shrink from the pains of hell. It was really love, he
says, which led to Peter’s denial; he need not have denied if he could have borne to keep
aloof, but love goaded him to be near his Lord.</p>
<p>(f.) The controversial works are</p>
<p>(i.) The “Eranistes,” or Dialogues, of which the translation is included in the text. They
contain a complete refutation of the Eutychian position, and the quotations in them are in
several cases valuable as giving portions of the writing of Fathers not elsewhere preserved.
They are supposed to have been written shortly after the death of Cyril in 444, and are intended
at once to vindicate Theodoret’s own orthodoxy, and to expose the errors of the
party protected by Dioscorus.</p>
<p>(ii.) The Hæreticarum Fabularum Compendium, (Αἱρετικῆς κακομυσιας ἐπιτομή) was
composed at the request of Sporacius, one of the representatives of Marcian at Chalcedon,
and is, as its title indicates, an account of past or present heresies. It is divided into five
Books, which treat of the following heretics.</p>
<p>I. Simon Magus, Menander, Saturnilus,143 Basilides, Isidorus, Carpocrates, Epiphanes,
Prodicus, Valentinus, Secundus, Marcus the Wizard, the Ascodruti,144 the Colorbasii, the
Barbelioti,145 the Ophites, the Cainites, the Antitacti, the Perati, Monoimus, Hermogenes,
Tatianus, Severus, Bardesanes, Harmonius, Florinus, Cerdo, Marcion, Apelles, Potitus,
Prepo, and Manes.</p>
<p>II. The Ebionites, the Nazarenes, Cerinthus, Artemon, Theodotus, the Melchisedeciani,
the Elkesites, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Marcellus, Photinus.</p>
<p>III. The Nicolaitans, the Montanists, Noetus of Smyrna, the Tessarescædecatites (i.e.
Quartodecimani) Novatus, Nepos.</p>
<p>IV. Arius, Eudoxius, Eunomius, Aetius, the Psathyriani, the Macedoniani, the Donatists,
the Meletians, Appollinarius, the Audiani, the Messaliani, Nestorius, Eutyches.</p>
<p>V. The last book is an “Epitome of the Divine Decrees.”</p>
<p>This catalogue, it has been remarked, does not include Origenism and Pelagianism.146
But though Theodoret did not sympathize with Origen’s school of scriptural interpretation,
<note type="footnote">143 Σατορνεῖλος or Σατορνῖλος in Hippolytus, Epiphanius, and Theodoret; but Σατορνῖνος (Saturninus) in

there was no reason why he should damn him as unsound in the faith. And the controversy
between Jerome and Rufinus as to Origen was a distinctively western controversy. So was
Pelagianism a western heresy, with which Theodoret was not brought into immediate contact.</p>
<p>The fourth book is obviously the most important, as treating of heresies of which the
writer would have contemporary knowledge. And special interest has attached to the chapter
on Nestorius, who is condemned not merely for erroneous opinion on the incarnation and
person of Christ, but as a timeserver and pretender, seeking rather to be thought, than to
be, a Christian. Garnerius indeed doubts the genuineness of the chapter, and Schulze, in
defending it, points out the similarity of its line of argument to that employed in the treatise
“against Nestorius,” which is very generally regarded as spurious. It may have been added
after Chalcedon, when the writer had been forced into the denunciation of his old friend.
But the expressions used alike of the incarnation and of Nestorius seem somewhat in contrast
with other writings of Theodoret. Schröckh147 inclines to the view in which Ceillier concurs,
that this damning account of Nestorius was really written by his old champion, and accounts
for the harshness of condemnation by the influence of the clamours of Chalcedon and the
induration which old age sometimes brings on tender spirits. It can only be said that if this
is Theodoret, it is Theodoret at his worst.</p>
<p>The heads of the Epitome of Divine Decrees are the following twenty-nine: Of the
Father; of the Son; of the Holy Ghost; of Creation; of Matter; of Æons; of Angels; of Dæmons;
of Man; of Providence; of the Incarnation of the Saviour; that the Lord took a body; that He
took a soul as well as His body; that the human nature which He took was perfect; that He
raised the nature which He took; that He is good and just; that He gave the Old and the New
Testament; of Baptism; of Resurrection; of Judgment; of Promises; of the Second Advent
(᾽Επιφάνεια) of the Saviour; of Antichrist; of Virginity; of Marriage; of Second Marriage; of
Fornication; of Repentance; of Abstinence.</p>
<p>The short chapter on the Incarnation has a special value in view of the author’s connection
with the Nestorian Controversy. “It is worth while,” he writes in it, “to exhibit what we
hold concerning the Incarnation, for this exposition proclaims more clearly the providence
of the God of all. In his forged fables Valentinus maintained a distinction between the onlybegotten
and the Word, and further between the Christ within the pleroma and Jesus, and
also the Christ who is without. He said that Jesus became man, by putting on the Christ that
is without, and assuming a body of the substance of the soul; and that He made a passage
only through the Virgin, having assumed nothing of the nature of man. Basilides in like
manner distinguished between the only-begotten, the Word and the Wisdom. Cerdon, on
the other hand, Marcion, and Manes, said that the Christ appeared as man, though he had
nothing human. Cerinthus maintained that Jesus was generated of Joseph and Mary after
<note type="footnote">147 xviii. 416.</note>

<pb n="52"/>
the common manner of men, but that the Christ came down from on high on Jesus. The
Ebionites, the Theodotians, the Artemonians, and Photinians said that the Christ was bare
man born of the Virgin. Arius and Eunomius taught that He assumed a body, but that the
Godhead discharged the function of the soul. Apollinarius held that the body of the Saviour
had a soul,148 but had not the reasonable soul; for, according to his views, intelligence was
superfluous, God the Word being present. I have stated the opinions taught by the majority
of heresies with the wish of making plain the truth taught by the church. Now the church
makes no distinction between (τὸν αὐτὸν ὀνομαζει) the Son, the only begotten, God the
Word, the Lord the Saviour, and Jesus Christ. ‘Son,’ ‘only begotten,’ ‘God the Word,’ and
‘Lord,’ He was called before the Incarnation; and is so called also after the Incarnation; but
after the Incarnation the same (Lord) was called Jesus Christ, deriving the titles from the
facts. ‘Jesus’ is interpreted to mean the Saviour, whereof Gabriel is witness in his words to
the Virgin ‘Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.’149
But He was styled ‘Christ’ on account of the unction of the Spirit. So the Psalmist David
says ‘Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.’
150 And through the Prophet Isaiah the Lord Himself says ‘The spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me.’151 Thus the Lord Himself taught us to understand
the prophecy, for when He had come into the synagogue, and opened the book of
the Prophets, He read the passage quoted, and said to those present ‘This day is the Scripture
fulfilled in your ears.’152 The great Peter, too, preached in terms harmonious with the
prophets, for in his explanation of the mystery to Cornelius he said ‘That word ye know
which was published throughout all Judæa, and began from Galilee after the Baptism which
John preached; how God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and with power.’153
Hence it is clear that He is called Christ on account of the unction of the spirit. But he was
anointed not as God, but as man. And as in His human nature He was anointed, after the
Incarnation He was called also ‘Christ.’ But yet there is no distinction between God the
Word and the Christ, for God the Word incarnate was named Christ Jesus. And He was
incarnate that He might renew the nature corrupted by sin. The reason of His taking all the
nature which had sinned was that He might heal all. For He did not take the nature of the
body using it as a veil of His Godhead, according to the wild teaching of Arius and Eunomius;
for it had been easy for Him even without a body to be made visible as He was seen of old

by Abraham, Jacob and the rest of the saints. But he wished the very nature that had been
worsted to beat down the enemy and win the victory. For this reason He took both a body
and a reasonable soul. For Holy Scripture does not divide man in a threefold division, but
states that this living being consists of a body and a soul.154 For God after forming the body
out of the dust breathed into it the soul and shewed it to be two natures not three. And the
same Lord in the Gospels says, ‘Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill
the soul,’155 and many similar passages may be found in divine Scripture. And that He did
not assume man’s nature in its perfection, contriving it as a veil for His Godhead, according
to the heretics’ fables, but achieving victory by means of the first fruits for the whole race,
is truly witnessed and accurately taught by the divine apostle, for in His Epistle to the Romans,
when unveiling the mystery of the Incarnation, he writes ‘Wherefore as by one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned: for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not sinned after
the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of Him that is to come.’156</p>
<p>(iii.) The refutations of the Twelve Chapters of Cyril are translated in the Prolegomena.157</p>
<p>In the Epistle of Cyril to Celestinus and the Commonitorium datum Posidonio158 Cyril
shows what sense he wishes to fix on the utterances of Nestorius. “The faith, or rather the
‘cacodoxy’ of Nestorius, has this force; he says that God the Word, prescient that he who
was to be born of the Holy Virgin would be holy and great, therefore chose him and arranged
that he should be generated of the Virgin without a husband and conferred on him the
privilege of being called by His own names, and raised him so that even though after the
incarnation he is called the only begotten Word of God, he is said to have been made man
because He was always with him as with a holy man born of the Virgin. And as He was with
the prophets so, says Nestorius, was He by a greater conjunction (συνάφεια). On this account
Nestorius always shrinks from using the word union (ἔνωσις) and speaks of ‘conjunction,’
as of some one without, and, as He says to Joshua ‘as I was with Moses so will I be with
thee.’159 But, to conceal his impiety, Nestorius says that He was with him from the womb.
Wherefore he does not say that Christ was very God, but that Christ was so called of God’s
good pleasure; and, if he was called Lord, so again Nestorius understands him to be Lord
because the divine Word conceded him the boon of being so named. Nor does he say as we

do that the Son of God died and rose again on our behalf. The man died and the man rose,
and this has nothing to do with God the Word. And in the mysteries what lies (i.e. on the
Holy Table) (τὸ προκείμενον) is a man’s body; but we believe that it is flesh of the Word,
having power to quicken because it is made flesh and blood of the Word that quickeneth
all things.”</p>
<p>Nestorius was not unnaturally indignant at this misrepresentation of his words, and
complains of Cyril for leaving out important clauses and introducing additions of his own.160
Cyril succeeded in pressing upon Celestinus the idea that Nestorius, who had vigorously
opposed the Pelagians, was really in sympathy with them, and so secured the condemnation
of his opponent at Rome and at Alexandria, and published twelve anathemas to complete
his own vindication. These were answered by Theodoret on behalf of the eastern church in
431. In 433 formal peace was made, so far as the theological, as apart from the personal,
dispute was concerned, by the acceptance by both John of Antioch and Cyril of the formula,
slightly modified, which Theodoret himself had drawn up at Ephesus two years before.161
It is as follows: “We confess our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only begotten, to be
perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, begotten before the ages of the
Father, as touching His godhead, and in the last days on account of us and our salvation
(born) of the Virgin Mary as touching His manhood; that He is of one substance with the
Father as touching His godhead, of one substance with us as touching His manhood; for
there is made an union of two natures; wherefore we confess one Christ, one Son, one Lord.
According to this meaning of the unconfounded union we confess the holy Virgin to be
‘θεοτόκος’ on account of God the Word being made flesh and becoming man, and of this
conception uniting to Himself the temple taken of her. We acknowledge that theologians
use the words of evangelists and apostles about the Lord some in common, as of one person,
and some distinctively, as of two natures, and deliver the divine as touching the Godhead
of the Christ, and the lowly as touching His manhood.”162</p>
<p>This is substantially what Theodoret says again and again. This satisfied Cyril. This
would probably have been accepted by Nestorius too.163 What then was it, apart from the
odium theologicum, which kept Nestorius and Cyril apart? Below the apparent special
pleading and word-jugglery on the surface of the controversy lay the principle that in the
Christ God and man were one; the essence of the atonement or reconciliation lying in the
complete union of the human and the divine in the one Person; the “I” in the “I am” of the

Temple and the “I thirst” of the Cross being really the same. “God and man is one Christ.”
The position which the Cyrillians viewed with alarm was a reduction of this unity to a mere
partnership or alliance;—God dwelling in Jesus of Nazareth as He dwells in all good men,
only to a greater degree;—the eternal Word being in close contact with the son of Mary
(συνάφεια). So, whatever may have been the unhappy faction-fights with which the main
issue was confused there was in truth a great crisis, a great question for decision; was Jesus
of Nazareth an unique personality, or only one more in the goodly fellowship of prophets?
Was He God, or was He not? There can be little doubt as to the answer Nestorius would
have given. There can be none as to that of Theodoret. But on the part of Cyril there was
the quite mistaken conviction that Theodoret was practically contending for two Christs.
On the other hand Theodoret erroneously identified Cyril with the confusion of the substance
and practical patripassianism which he scathes in the “Eranistes,” and which the common
sense of Christendom has condemned in Eutyches.</p>

known,164 and he is eloquent in their praise. Now, the collection, including several by other
writers, comprises only one hundred and eighty one. The value of their contributions to the
history of the times as well as of their writer will be evident on their study. The order in
which they are published is preserved in the translation for the sake of reference. A chronological
order would have obvious advantages, but this in many cases could only be conjectural.
Where the indications of time are fairly plain the probable date is suggested in a note.
The letters are divided into (a) dogmatic, (b) consolatory, (c) festal, (d) commendatory, (e)
congratulatory, (f) commenting on passing events. Of them Schulze writes “Nihil eo in
genere scribendi perfectius; nam quæ sunt epistolarum virtutes, brevitas, perspicuitas, elegantia,
urbanitas, modestia, observantia decori, et ingeniosa prudensque ac erudita simplicitas,
in epistolis Theodoreti admirabiliter ita elucent ut scribentibus exempla esse possint.” “They
not only” says Schröckh,165 “vindicate the admiration of Nicephorus, but are specially attractive
on account of their exhibition of the writer’s simplicity, modesty, and love of peace.”</p>
<p>From the study of these letters “we rise,” writes Canon Venables,166 “with a heightened
estimate of Theodoret himself, his intellectual power, his theological precision, his warmhearted
affection for his friends, and the Christian virtues with which, notwithstanding
some weaknesses and an occasional bitterness for which, however distressing, his persecutions
offered some palliation, his character was adorned.”</p>
<p>The reputation of Theodoret in the Church is a growing reputation, and the practical
canonization which he has won in the heart of Christendom is a testimony to the power

and worth of character and conduct. Though never officially dignified by a higher ecclesiastical
title than “Beatus” he is yet to Marcellinus “Episcopus sanctus Cyri”167 and to Photius168
“divinus vir.” His earnest, sometimes bitter, conflict with the great intellect and strong
will of Cyril, and apparent discomfiture in the war which raged, often with dire confusion,
up and down the long lines of definition, have not succeeded in robbing him of one of the
highest places among the Fathers of whom the Church is proudest. He exhibits, each in a
lofty and conspicuous form, all the qualities which mark a great and good churchman. His
theological writings would have won high fame in a recluse. His administration of his diocese,
as we learn it from his modest letters, would have gained him the character of an excellent
bishop, even had he been no scholar. His temper in controversy, though occasionally
breaking out into the fiery heat of the oriental, is for the most part in happy contrast with
that of his opponents. His devotion to his duty is undeniable, and his industry astonishing.
It is impossible not to feel as we read his writings that he is no self-seeker arguing for victory.
He believes that the fate of the Church rests on the fidelity of Christians to the Nicene
Confession, and in his championship of this creed, and his opposition to all that seems to
him to threaten its adulteration or defeat, he knows no awe of prince or court. Owning but
one Lord, he is true through evil and good report to Him, and his figure stands out large,
bright, and gracious across the centuries, against a background of intrigue and controversy
sometimes very dark, as of a patient and faithful soldier and servant of Christ.169 If his
shortcomings were those of his own age,—and in an age of virulent strife and of denial of
all mercy to opponents his memory rises as a comparative monument of moderation,—his
graces were the graces of all the ages.170 Were it customary, or even possible, in our own
church and time to maintain the ancient custom of reciting before the Holy Table the names
approved as of good men and true in the past history of the Holy Society, in the long catalogue
of the faithful departed for whom worshippers bless the name of their common Lord, a
place must indubitably be kept for Theodoretus, bishop of Cyrus.</p>

the holy Virgin is Mother of God (θεοτόκος), for she gave birth after a fleshly manner to
the Word of God made flesh; let him be anathema.</p>

to flesh, and is one Christ with His own flesh, the same being at once both God and man,
let him be anathema.</p>

them by the conjunction alone which is according to dignity, independence, or
prerogative, and not rather by the concurrence which is according to natural union, let him
be anathema.</p>
<p>IV. If any one divides between two persons or hypostases the expressions used in the
writings of evangelists and apostles, whether spoken by the saints of Christ or by Him about
Himself, and applies the one as to a man considered properly apart from the Word of God,
and the others as appropriate to the divine and the Word of God the Father alone, let him
be anathema.</p>

He is God in truth, and one Son, and by nature, according as the Word was made flesh, and
shared blood and flesh in like manner with ourselves, let him be anathema.</p>

the Christ, and does not rather confess that the same was at once both God and man, the
Word being made flesh according to the Scriptures, let him be anathema.</p>

invested with the glory of the only begotten as being another beside Him, let him be anathema.</p>

with the divine Word, and be glorified with Him, and with Him be called God as one with
another (in that the continual rise of the preposition “with” in composition makes this sense
compulsory), and does not rather in one act of worship honour the Emmanuel and praise
Him in one doxology, in that He is the Word made flesh, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>IX. If any one says that the one Lord Jesus Christ is glorified by the Spirit, using the
power that works through Him as a foreign power, and receiving from Him the ability to
operate against unclean spirits, and to complete His miracles among men; and does not

rather say that the Spirit is His own, whereby also He wrought His miracles, let him be
anathema.</p>

offered Himself on our behalf for a sweet-smelling savour to God and our Father.172 If,
then, any one says that He, the Word of God, was not made our High Priest and Apostle
when He was made flesh and man after our manner; but as being another, other than
Himself, properly man made of a woman; or if any one says that He offered the offering on
His own behalf, and not rather on our behalf alone; for He that knew no sin would not have
needed an offering, let him be anathema.</p>

Word of God Himself, but (states) that it is of another than Him, united indeed to Him in
dignity, yet as only possessing a divine indwelling; and not rather, as we said, giver of life,
because it is proper to the Word of Him who hath might to engender all things alive, let
him be anathema.</p>

in flesh, and tasted death in flesh, and was made firstborn of the dead, in so far as He is life
and giver of life, as God; let him be anathema.</p>

<head>Counter-statements of Theodoret.</head>
<p>(Opp. Ed. Schulze. V. I. seq. Migne, Lat. 76. col. 391.)</p>
<p>Against I.—But all we who follow the words of the evangelists state that God the Word
was not made flesh by nature, nor yet was changed into flesh; for the Divine is immutable
and invariable. Wherefore also the prophet David says, “Thou art the same, and thy years
shall not fail.”174 And this the great Paul, the herald of the truth, in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
states to have been spoken of the Son.175 And in another place God says through the
Prophet, “I am the Lord: I change not.”176 If then the Divine is immutable and invariable,
it is incapable of change or alteration. And if the immutable cannot be changed, then God
the Word was not made flesh by mutation, but took flesh and tabernacled in us, according
to the word of the evangelist. This the divine Paul expresses clearly in his Epistle to the
Philippians in the words, “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of no
reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.”177 Now it is plain from these words
that the form of God was not changed into the form of a servant, but, remaining what it
was, took the form of the servant. So God the Word was not made flesh, but assumed living
and reasonable flesh. He Himself is not naturally conceived of the Virgin, fashioned, formed,
and deriving beginning of existence from her; He who is before the ages, God, and with
God, being with the Father and with the Father both known and worshipped; but He fashioned
for Himself a temple in the Virgin’s womb, and was with that which was formed and
begotten. Wherefore also we style that holy Virgin θεοτόκος, not because she gave birth in
natural manner to God, but to man united to the God that had fashioned Him. Moreover
if He that was fashioned in the Virgin’s womb was not man but God the Word Who is before
the ages, then God the Word is a creature of the Holy Ghost. For that which was conceived
in her, says Gabriel, is of the Holy Ghost.178 But if the only begotten Word of God is uncreate
and of one substance and co-eternal with the Father it is no longer a formation or creation
of the Spirit. And if the Holy Ghost did not fashion God the Word in the Virgin’s womb, it
follows that we understand the form of the servant to have been fashioned, formed, conceived,
and generated. But since the form was not stripped of the form of God, but was a Temple

containing God the Word dwelling in it, according to the words of Paul “For it pleased the
Father that in him should all fulness dwell” “bodily,”179 we call the Virgin not mother of
man (ἀνθρωποτόκος) but mother of God (θεοτόκος), applying the former title to the fashioning
and conception, but the latter to the union. For this cause the child who was born is
called Emmanuel, neither God separated from human nature nor man stripped of Godhead.
For Emmanuel is interpreted to mean “God with us”, according to the words of the Gospels;
and the expression “God with us” at once manifests Him Who for our sakes was assumed
out of us, and proclaims God the Word Who assumed. Therefore the child is called Emmanuel
on account of God Who assumed, and the Virgin θεοτόκος on account of the union
of the form of God with the conceived form of a servant. For God the Word was not changed
into flesh, but the form of God took the form of a servant.</p>
<p>Against II.—We, in obedience to the divine teaching of the apostles, confess one Christ;
and, on account of the union, we name the same both God and man. But we are wholly ignorant
of the union according to hypostasis180 as being strange and foreign to the divine
Scriptures and the Fathers who have interpreted them. And if the author of these statements
means by the union according to hypostasis that there was a mixture of flesh and Godhead,
we shall oppose his statement with all our might, and shall confute his blasphemy, for the
mixture is of necessity followed by confusion; and the admission of confusion destroys the
individuality of each nature. Things that are undergoing mixture do not remain what they
were, and to assert this in the case of God the Word and of the seed of David would be most
absurd. We must obey the Lord when He exhibits the two natures and says to the Jews,
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”181 But if there had been mixture
then God had not remained God, neither was the temple recognised as a temple; then the
temple was God and God was temple. This is involved in the theory of the mixture. And it
was quite superfluous for the Lord to say to the Jews, “Destroy this temple and in three days
I will raise it up.” He ought to have said, Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised, if
there had really been any mixture and confusion. As it is, He exhibits the temple undergoing
destruction and God raising it up. Therefore the union according to hypostasis, which in
my opinion they put before us instead of mixture, is superfluous. It is quite sufficient to
mention the union, which both exhibits the properties of the natures and teaches us to
worship the one Christ.</p>
<p>Against III.—The sense of the terms used is misty and obscure. Who needs to be told
that there is no difference between conjunction and concurrence? The concurrence is a
concurrence of the separated parts; and the conjunction is a conjunction of the distinguished
<note type="footnote">179 Coloss. i. 19, and ii. 9</note>
<note type="footnote">180 cf. n. p. 72.</note>
<note type="footnote">181 John ii. 19</note>

<pb n="62"/>
parts. The very clever author of the phrases has laid down things that agree as though they
disagreed. It is wrong, he says, to conjoin the hypostases by conjunction; they ought to be
conjoined by concurrence, and that a natural concurrence. Possibly he states this not
knowing what he says; if he knows, he blasphemes. Nature has a compulsory force and is
involuntary; as for instance, if I say we are naturally hungry, we do not feel hunger of freewill
but of necessity; and assuredly paupers would have left off begging if the power of
ceasing to be hungry had lain in their own will; we are naturally thirsty; we naturally sleep;
we naturally breathe; and all these actions, I repeat, belong to the category of the involuntary,
and he who is no longer capable of them necessarily ceases to exist. If then the concurrence
in union of the form of God and the form of a servant was natural, then God the Word was
united to the form of the servant under the compulsion of necessity, and not because He
put in force His loving kindness, and the Lawgiver of the Universe will be found to be a
follower of the laws of necessity. Not thus have we been taught by the blessed Paul; on the
contrary, we have been taught that He took the form of a servant and “emptied Himself;”182
and the expression “emptied Himself” indicates the voluntary act. If then He was united by
purpose and will to the nature assumed from us, the addition of the term natural is superfluous.
It suffices to confess the union, and union is understood of things distinguished, for
if there were no division an union could never be apprehended. The apprehension then of
the union implies previous apprehension of the division. How then can he say that the hypostases
or natures ought not to be divided? He knows all the while that the hypostasis of
God the Word was perfect before the ages; and that the form of the servant which was assumed
by It was perfect; and this is the reason why he said hypostases and not hypostasis.
If therefore either nature is perfect, and both came together, it is obvious that after the form
of God had taken the form of a servant, piety compels us to confess one son and Christ;
while to speak of the united hypostases or natures as two, so far from being absurd, follows
the necessity of the case. For if in the case of the one man we divide the natures, and call the
mortal nature body, but the immortal nature soul, and both man, much more consonant is
it with right reason to recognise the properties alike of the God who took and of the man
who was taken. We find the blessed Paul dividing the one man into two where he says in
one passage, “Though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed,”183 and in
another “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.”184 And again “that Christ
may dwell in the inner man.”185 Now if the apostle divides the natural conjunction of the
synchronous natures, with what reason can the man who describes the mixture to us by

<pb n="63"/>
means of other terms indite us as impious when we divide the properties of the natures of
the everlasting God and of the man assumed at the end of days?</p>
<p>Against IV.—These statements, too, are akin to the preceding. On the assumption that
there has been a mixture, he means that there is a distinction of terms as used both in the
holy Gospels and in the apostolic writings. And he uses this language while glorifying himself
that he is at war at once with Arius and Eunomius and the rest of the heresiarchs. Let then
this exact professor of theology tells us how he would confute the blasphemy of the heretics,
while applying to God the Word what is uttered humbly and appropriately by the form of
the servant. They indeed while thus doing lay down that the Son of God is inferior, a creature,
made, and a servant. To whom then are we, holding as we do the opposite opinion to theirs,
and confessing the Son to be of one substance and co-eternal with God the Father, Creator
of the Universe, Maker, Beautifier, Ruler, and Governor, All-wise, Almighty, or rather
Himself, Power, Life and Wisdom, to refer the words “My God, my God why hast thou
forsaken me;”186 or “Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me;”187 or “Father save
me from this hour;”188 or “That hour no man knoweth, not even the Son of Man;”189 and
all the other passages spoken and written in lowliness by Him and by the holy apostles about
Him? To whom shall we apply the weariness and the sleep? To whom the ignorance and
the fear? Who was it who stood in need of angelic succour? If these belong to God the Word,
how was wisdom ignorant? How could it be called wisdom when affected by the sense of
ignorance? How could He speak the truth in saying that He had all that the Father hath,190
when not having the knowledge of the Father? For He says, “The Father alone knoweth that
day.”191 How could He be the unchanged image of Him that begat Him if He has not all
that the Begetter hath? If then He speaks the truth when saying that He is ignorant, any one
might suppose this of Him. But if He knoweth the day, but says that He is ignorant with the
wish to hide it, you see in what a blasphemy the conclusion issues. For the truth lies and
could not properly be called truth if it has any quality opposed to truth. But if the truth does
not lie, neither is God the Word ignorant of the day which He Himself made, and which
He Himself fixed, wherein He purposes to judge the world, but has the knowledge of the
Father as being unchanged image. Not then to God the Word does the ignorance belong,
but to the form of the servant who at that time knew as much as the indwelling Godhead
revealed. The same position may be maintained about other similar cases. How for instance
<note type="footnote">186 Matt. xxvii. 48</note>
<note type="footnote">187 Matt. xxvi. 39</note>
<note type="footnote">188 John xii. 27</note>

<pb n="64"/>
could it be reasonable for God the Word to say to the Father, “Father if it be possible let this
cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt”?192 The absurdities which
necessarily thence follow are not a few. First it follows that the Father and the Son are not
of the same mind, and that the Father wishes one thing and the Son another, for He said,
“Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt.” Secondly we shall have to contemplate great
ignorance in the Son, for He will be found ignorant whether the cup can or cannot pass
from Him; but to say this of God the Word is utter impiety and blasphemy. For exactly did
He know the end of the mystery of the oeconomy Who for this very reason came among us,
Who of His own accord took our nature, Who emptied Himself. For this cause too He
foretold to the Holy Apostles, “Behold we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be
betrayed<gap reason="omitted"/>into the hands of the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and
the third day He shall rise again.”193 How then can He Who foretold these things, and, when
Peter deprecated their coming to pass, rebuked him, Himself deprecate their coming to
pass, when He clearly knows all that is to be? Is it not absurd that Abraham many generations
ago should have seen His day and have been glad,194 and that Isaiah in like manner, and
Jeremiah, and Daniel, and Zechariah, and all the fellowship of the prophets, should have
foretold His saving passion, and He Himself be ignorant, and beg release from and deprecate
it, though it was destined to come to pass for the salvation of the world? Therefore these
words are not the words of God the Word, but of the form of the servant, afraid of death
because death was not yet destroyed.195 Surely God the Word permitted the utterance of
these expressions allowing room for fear, that the nature of Him that had to be born may
be plain, and to prevent our supposing the Son of Abraham and David to be an unreality
or appearance. The crew of the impious heretics has given birth to this blasphemy through
entertaining these sentiments. We shall therefore apply what is divinely spoken and acted
to God the Word; on the other hand what is said and done in humility we shall connect
with the form of a servant, lest we be tainted with the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius.</p>

or patriot’s high calling, who have nevertheless faced death and pain with calm and cheerful fortitude. The bitterness
of the cup which the Saviour prayed might if possible pass from Him seems rather to have lain in the
culmination of the sin of the race and nation with which His love for men had identified Him; the greed, the
treachery, the meanness, the cruelty, the disloyalty, shewn by the Sons of Israel to the Son of David, by the sons

<pb n="65"/>
<p>Against V.—We assert that God the Word shared like ourselves in flesh and blood, and
in immortal soul, on account of the union relating to them; but that God the Word was
made flesh by any change we not only refuse to say, but accuse of impiety those who do,
and it may be seen that this is contrary to the very terms laid down. For if the Word was
changed into flesh He did not share with us in flesh and blood: but if He shared in flesh and
blood He shared as being another besides them: and if the flesh is anything other besides
Him, then He was not changed into flesh. While therefore we use the term sharing196 we
worship both Him that took and that which was taken as one Son. But we reckon the distinction
of the natures. We do not object to the term man bearing God, as employed by
many of the holy Fathers, one of whom is the great Basil, who uses this term in his argument
to Amphilochius about the Holy Ghost, and in his interpretation of the fifty-ninth psalm.
But we call Him man bearing God, not because He received some particular divine grace,
but as possessing all the Godhead of the Son united. For thus says the blessed Paul in his
interpretation, “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after
the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him
dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”197</p>
<p>Against VI.—The blessed Paul calls that which was assumed by God the Word “form
of a servant,”198 but since the assumption was prior to the union, and the blessed Paul was
discoursing about the assumption when he called the nature which was assumed “form of
a servant,” after the making of the union the name of “servitude” has no longer place. For
seeing that the Apostle when writing to them that believed in Him said, “So thou art not a
servant but a son”199 and the Lord said to His disciples, “Henceforth I will not call you servants
but friends;”200 much more the first fruits of our nature, through whom even we were
guerdoned with the boon of adoption, would be released from the title of servant. We
therefore confess even “the form of the servant” to be God on account of the form of God
united to it; and we bow to the authority of the prophet when he calls the babe also Emmanuel,
and the child which was born, “Angel of great counsel, wonderful Counsellor,
mighty God, powerful, Prince of peace, and Father of the age to come.”201 Yet the same
prophet, even after the union, when proclaiming the nature of that which was assumed,
calls him who is of the seed of Abraham “servant” in the words “Thou art my servant O Israel
and in thee will I be glorified;”202 and again, “Thus says the Lord that formed me from the

womb to be his servant;”203 and a little further on, “Lo I have given thee for a covenant of
the people, for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
earth.”204 But what was formed from the womb was not God the Word but the form of the
servant. For God the Word was not made flesh by being changed, but He assumed flesh
with a rational soul.</p>
<p>Against VII.—If the nature of man is mortal, and God the Word is life and giver of life,
and raised up the temple which had been destroyed by the Jews, and carried it into heaven,
how is not the form of the servant glorified through the form of God? For if being originally
and by nature mortal it was made immortal through its union with God the Word, it
therefore received what it had not; and after receiving what it had not, and being glorified,
it is glorified by Him who gave. Wherefore also the Apostle exclaims, “According to the
working of His mighty power which he wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the
dead.”205</p>
<p>Against VIII.—As I have often said, the doxology which we offer to the Lord Christ is
one, and we confess the same to be at once God and man, as the method of the union has
taught us; but we shall not shrink from speaking of the properties of the natures. For God
the Word did not undergo change into flesh, nor yet again did the man lose what he was
and undergo transmutation into the nature of God. Therefore we worship the Lord Christ,
while we maintain the properties of either nature.</p>
<p>Against IX.—Here he has plainly had the hardihood to anathematize not only those
who at the present time hold pious opinions, but also those who were in former days heralds
of truth; aye even the writers of the divine gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in
addition to these, Gabriel the archangel. For he indeed it was who first, even before the
conception, announced the birth of the Christ according to the flesh; saying in reply to Mary
when she asked, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” “The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing
that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”206 And to Joseph he said, “Fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Ghost.”207 And the Evangelist says, “When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph<gap reason="omitted"/>she

was found with child of the Holy Ghost.”208 And the Lord Himself when He had come into
the synagogue of the Jews and had taken the prophet Isaiah, after reading the passage in
which he says, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me” and so on,
added, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.”209 And the blessed Peter in his sermon
to the Jews said, “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.”210 And Isaiah
many ages before had predicted, “There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
a branch shall grow out of his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
and of the fear of the Lord;”211 and again, “Behold my servant whom I uphold, my beloved
in whom my soul delighteth. I will put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment
to the Gentiles.”212 This testimony the Evangelist too has inserted in his own writings. And
the Lord Himself in the Gospels says to the Jews, “If I with the spirit of God cast out devils,
no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.”213 And John says, “He that sent me to
baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”214 So this
exact examiner of the divine decrees has not only anathematized prophets, apostles, and
even the archangel Gabriel, but has suffered his blasphemy to reach even the Saviour of the
world Himself. For we have shewn that the Lord Himself after reading the passage “The
spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me,” said to the Jews, “This day is
this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” And to those who said that He was casting out devils
by Beelzebub He replied that He was casting them out by the Spirit of God. But we maintain
that it was not God the Word, of one substance and co-eternal with the Father, that was
formed by the Holy Ghost and anointed, but the human nature which was assumed by Him
at the end of days. We shall confess that the Spirit of the Son was His own if he spoke of it
as of the same nature and proceeding from the Father, and shall accept the expression as
consistent with true piety. But if he speaks of the Spirit as being of the Son, or as having its
origin through the Son we shall reject this statement as blasphemous and impious. For we
believe the Lord when He says, “The spirit which proceedeth from the Father;”215 and

likewise the very divine Paul saying, “We have received not the spirit of the world, but the
spirit which is of God.”216</p>
<p>Against X.—The unchangeable nature was not changed into nature of flesh, but assumed
human nature and set it over the common high priests, as the blessed Paul teaches in the
words, “For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining
to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the
ignorant and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is encompassed with
infirmity. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people so also for himself.”217 And a
little further on interpreting this he says, “As was Aaron so also was the Christ.”218 Then
pointing out the infirmity of the assumed nature he says, “Who in the days of His flesh,
when He had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto Him
that was able to save Him from death, and was heard for His godly fear, though He was a
son yet learned obedience by the things that He suffered: and having been made perfect He
became unto all that obey Him the author of eternal salvation; named of God a high priest
of the order of Melchisedec.”219 Who then is He who was perfected by toils of virtue and
who was not perfect by nature? Who is He who learnt obedience by experience, and before
his experience was ignorant of it? Who is it that lived with godly fear and offered supplication
with strong crying and tears, not able to save Himself but appealing to Him that is able to
save Him and asking for release from death? Not God the Word, the impassible, the immortal,
the incorporeal, whose memory is joy and release from tears, “For he has wiped away tears
from off all faces,”220 and again the prophet says, “I remembered God and was glad,”221
Who crowneth them that live in godly fear, “Who knoweth all things before they be,”222
“Who hath all things that the Father hath;”223 Who is the unchangeable image of the Father,
224 “Who sheweth the Father in himself.”225 It is on the contrary that which was assumed
by Him of the seed of David, mortal, passible, and afraid of death; although this itself afterwards
destroyed the power of death through union with the God who had assumed it;226

which walked through all righteousness and said to John, “Suffer it to be so now for thus it
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.”227 This took the name of the priesthood of
Melchisedec, for it put on infirmity of nature;—not the Almighty God the Word. Wherefore
also, a little before, the blessed Paul said, “We have not a high priest which cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without
sin.”228 It was the nature taken from us for our sakes which experienced our feelings without
sin, not He that on account of our salvation assumed it. And in the beginning of this part
of his subject he teaches us in the words “Consider the apostle and high priest of our profession,
Jesus, who was faithful to Him that appointed Him as also Moses was faithful in all
His house.”229 But no one holding the right faith would call the unmade the uncreate, God
the Word coeternal with the Father, a creature; but on the contrary, Him of David’s seed
Who being free from all sin was made our high priest and victim, after Himself offering
Himself on our behalf to God having in Himself the Word, God of God, united to Himself
and inseparably conjoined.</p>
<p>Against XI.—In my opinion he appears to give heed to the truth, in order that, by concealing
his unsound views by it, he may not be detected in asserting the same dogmas as the
heretics. But nothing is stronger than truth, which by its own rays uncovers the darkness
of falsehood. By the aid of its illumination we shall make his heterodox belief plain. In the
first place he has nowhere made mention of intelligent flesh, nor confessed that the assumed
man was perfect, but everywhere in accordance with the teaching of Apollinarius he speaks
of flesh. Secondly, after introducing the conception of the mixture under other terms, he
brings it into his arguments; for there he clearly states the flesh of the Lord to be soulless.
For, he says, if any one states that the flesh of the Lord is not proper flesh of the very Word
who is of God the Father, but that it is of another beside Him, let him be anathema. Hence
it is plain that he does not confess God the Word to have assumed a soul, but only flesh,
and that He Himself stands to the flesh in place of soul. We on the contrary assert that the
flesh of the Lord having in it life230 was life-giving and reasonable, on account of the lifegiving
Godhead united to it. And he himself unwillingly confesses the difference between
the two natures, speaking of flesh, and “God the Word” and calling it “His own flesh.”
Therefore God the Word was not changed into nature of flesh, but has His own flesh, the
assumed nature, and has made it life-giving by the union.</p>

permitting it to suffer on account of the salvation brought forth of the sufferings, and
making the sufferings its own on account of the union. Therefore it was not the Christ231
who suffered, but the man assumed of us by God. Wherefore also the blessed Isaiah exclaims
in his prophecy, “A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.”232 And the Lord Christ
Himself said to the Jews, “Why seek ye to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth?”233
But what is threatened with death is not the very life, but he that hath a mortal nature. And
giving this lesson in another place the Lord said to the Jews, “Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up.”234 Therefore what was destroyed was the (temple descended)
from David, and, after its destruction, it was raised up by the only begotten Word of God
impassibly begotten of the Father before the ages.</p>
<note type="footnote">231 For “the Christ” we might expect here “the Word,” for that the Christ suffered is the plain statement of

<head>Book I.</head>
<p>Prologue.—Design of the History.</p>
<p>When artists paint on panels and on walls the events of ancient history, they alike delight
the eye, and keep bright for many a year the memory of the past. Historians substitute books
for panels, bright description for pigments, and thus render the memory of past events both
stronger and more permanent, for the painter’s art is ruined by time. For this reason I too
shall attempt to record in writing events in ecclesiastical history hitherto omitted, deeming
it indeed not right to look on without an effort while oblivion robs235 noble deeds and useful
stories of their due fame. For this cause too I have been frequently urged by friends to undertake
this work. But when I compare my own powers with the magnitude of the undertaking,
I shrink from attempting it. Trusting, however, in the bounty of the Giver of all good,
I enter upon a task beyond my own strength.</p>
<p>Eusebius of Palestine236 has written a history of the Church from the time of the holy
Apostles to the reign of Constantine, the prince beloved of God. I shall begin my history
from the period at which his terminates.237</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Origin of the Arian Heresy.</head>
<p>After the overthrow of the wicked and impious tyrants, Maxentius, Maximinus, and
Licinius, the surge which those destroyers, like hurricanes, had roused was hushed to sleep;
the whirlwinds were checked, and the Church henceforward began to enjoy a settled calm.
This was established for her by Constantine, a prince deserving of all praise, whose calling,
like that of the divine Apostle, was not of men, nor by man, but from heaven. He enacted
laws prohibiting sacrifices to idols, and commanding churches238 to be erected. He appointed
Christians to be governors of the provinces, ordering honour to be shown to the priests,
and threatening with death those who dared to insult them. By some the churches which
had been destroyed were rebuilt; others erected new ones still more spacious and magnificent.
Hence, for us, all was joy and gladness, while our enemies were overwhelmed with gloom
and despair. The temples of the idols were closed; but frequent assemblies were held, and
festivals celebrated, in the churches. But the devil, full of all envy and wickedness, the destroyer
of mankind, unable to bear the sight of the Church sailing on with favourable winds,
stirred up plans of evil counsel, eager to sink the vessel steered by the Creator and Lord of
the Universe. When he began to perceive that the error of the Greeks had been made
manifest, that the various tricks of the demons had been detected, and that the greater
number of men worshipped the Creator, instead of adoring, as heretofore, the creature, he
did not dare to declare open war against our God and Saviour; but having found some who,
though dignified with the name of Christians, were yet slaves to ambition and vainglory, he
made them fit instruments for the execution of his designs, and by their means drew others
back into their old error, not indeed by the former method of setting up the worship of the
creature, but by bringing it about that the Creator and Maker of all should be reduced to a
level with the creature. I shall now proceed to relate where and by what means he sowed
these tares.</p>
<p>Alexandria is an immense and populous city, charged with the leadership not only of
Egypt, but also of the adjacent countries, the Thebaid and Libya. After Peter239, the victorious
champion of the faith, had, during the sway of the aforesaid impious tyrants, obtained the
crown of martyrdom, the Church in Alexandria was ruled for a short time by Achillas240.

He was succeeded by Alexander241, who proved himself a noble defender of the doctrines
of the gospel. At that time, Arius, who had been enrolled in the list of the presbytery, and
entrusted with the exposition of the Holy Scriptures, fell a prey to the assaults of jealousy,
when he saw that the helm of the high priesthood was committed to Alexander. Stung by
this passion, he sought opportunities for dispute and contention; and, although he perceived
that Alexander’s irreproachable conduct forbade his bringing any charges against him, envy
would not allow him to rest. In him the enemy of the truth found an instrument whereby
to stir and agitate the angry waters of the Church, and persuaded him to oppose the
apostolical doctrine of Alexander. While the Patriarch, in obedience to the Holy Scriptures,
taught that the Son is of equal dignity with the Father, and of the same substance with God
who begat Him, Arius, in direct opposition to the truth, affirmed that the Son of God is
merely a creature or created being, adding the famous dictum, “There once was a time when
He was not242;” with other opinions which may be learned from his own writings. He taught
these false doctrines perseveringly, not only in the church, but also in general meetings and
assemblies; and he even went from house to house, endeavouring to make men the slaves
of his error. Alexander, who was strongly attached to the doctrines of the Apostles, at first
tried by exhortations and counsels to convince him of his error; but when he saw him
playing the madman243 and making public declaration of his impiety, he deposed him from
the order of the presbytery, for he heard the law of God loudly declaring, “If thy right eye
offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee244.”</p>

<p>Of the church of Rome at this period Silvester245 held the reins. His predecessor in the
see was Miltiades246, the successor of that Marcellinus247 who had so nobly distinguished
himself during the persecution.</p>
<p>In Antioch, after the death of Tyrannus248, when peace began to be restored to the
churches, Vitalis249 received the chief authority, and restored the church in the “Palæa250”
which had been destroyed by the tyrants. He was succeeded by Philogonius251, who completed
all that was wanting in the work of restoration: he had, during the time of Licinius,
signalised himself by his zeal for religion.</p>
<p>After the administration of Hermon252, the government of the church in Jerusalem was
committed to Macarius253, a man whose character was equal to his name, and whose mind
was adorned by every kind of virtue.</p>
<p>At this same period also, Alexander, illustrious for his apostolical gifts, governed the
church of Constantinople254.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, perceiving that Arius, enslaved
by the lust of power, was assembling those who had been taken captive by his blasphemous
doctrines, and was holding private meetings, communicated an account of his heresy by
letter to the rulers of the principal churches. That the authenticity of my history may not

<head>Chapter III.—The Epistle of Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria to Alexander, Bishop of Constantinople.</head>
<p>“To his most revered and likeminded brother Alexander, Alexander sendeth greeting
in the Lord.</p>
<p>“Impelled by avarice and ambition, evil-minded persons have ever plotted against the
wellbeing of the most important dioceses. Under various pretexts, they attack the religion
of the Church; and, being maddened by the devil, who works in them, they start aside from
all piety according to their own pleasure, and trample under foot the fear of the judgment
of God. Suffering as I do from them myself, I deem it necessary to inform your piety, that
you may be on your guard against them, lest they or any of their party should presume to
enter your diocese (for these cheats are skilful in deception), or should circulate false and
specious letters, calculated to delude one who has devoted himself to the simple and undefiled
faith.</p>
<p>“Arius and Achillas have lately formed a conspiracy, and, emulating the ambition of
Colluthus, have gone far beyond him255. He indeed sought to find a pretext for his own
pernicious line of action in the charges he brought against them. But they, beholding his
making a trade of Christ for lucre256, refused to remain any longer in subjection to the
Church; but built for themselves caves, like robbers, and now constantly assemble in them,
and day and night ply slanders there against Christ and against us. They revile every godly
apostolical doctrine, and in Jewish fashion have organized a gang to fight against Christ,
denying His divinity, and declaring Him to be on a level with other men. They pick out
every passage which refers to the dispensation of salvation, and to His humiliation for our
sake; they endeavour to collect from them their own impious assertion, while they evade all
those which declare His eternal divinity, and the unceasing257 glory which He possesses
with the Father. They maintain the ungodly doctrine entertained by the Greeks and the Jews
concerning Jesus Christ; and thus, by every means in their power, hunt for their applause.
Everything which outsiders ridicule in us they officiously practise. They daily excite persecutions
and seditions against us. On the one hand they bring accusations against us before
the courts, suborning as witnesses certain unprincipled women whom they have seduced
into error. On the other they dishonour Christianity by permitting their young women to
<note type="footnote">255 Alexander’s words seem to imply that Colluthus began his schismatical proceedings in assuming to exercise
episcopal functions before the separation of Arius from the Church, and that one cause of his wrong action was
impatience at the mild course at first adopted by Alexander towards Arius. The Council of Alexandria held in
a.d. 324 under Hosius, decided that he was only a Presbyter.</note>

ramble about the streets. Nay, they have had the audacity to rend the seamless garment of
Christ, which the soldiers dared not divide.</p>
<p>“When these actions, in keeping with their course of life, and the impious enterprise
which had been long concealed, became tardily known to us, we unanimously ejected them
from the Church which worships the divinity of Christ. They then ran hither and thither
to form cabals against us, even addressing themselves to our fellow-ministers who were of
one mind with us, under the pretence of seeking peace and unity with them, but in truth
endeavouring by means of fair words, to sweep some among them away into their own
disease. They ask them to write a wordy letter, and then read the contents to those whom
they have deceived, in order that they may not retract, but be confirmed in their impiety,
by finding that bishops agree with and support their views. They make no acknowledgment
of the evil doctrines and practices for which they have been expelled by us, but they either
impart them without comment, or carry on the deception by fallacies and forgeries. Thus
concealing their destructive doctrine by persuasive and meanly truckling language, they
catch the unwary, and lose no opportunity of calumniating our religion. Hence it arises that
several have been led to sign their letter, and to receive them into communion, a proceeding
on the part of our fellow-ministers which I consider highly reprehensible; for they thus not
only disobey the apostolical rule, but even help to inflame their diabolical action against
Christ. It is on this account, beloved brethren, that without delay I have stirred myself up
to inform you of the unbelief of certain persons who say that “There was a time when the
Son of God was not258;” and “He who previously had no existence subsequently came into
existence; and when at some time He came into existence He became such as every other
man is.” God, they say, created all things out of that which was non-existent, and they include
in the number of creatures, both rational and irrational, even the Son of God. Consistently
with this doctrine they, as a necessary consequence, affirm that He is by nature liable to
change, and capable both of virtue and of vice, and thus, by their hypothesis of his having
been created out of that which was non-existent, they overthrow the testimony of the Divine
Scriptures, which declare the immutability of the Word and the Divinity of the Wisdom of
the Word, which Word and Wisdom is Christ. ‘We are also able,’ say these accursed wretches,
‘to become like Him, the sons of God; for it is written,—I have nourished and brought up
children259.’ When the continuation of this text is brought before them, which is, ‘and they
have rebelled against Me,’ and it is objected that these words are inconsistent with the Saviour’s
nature, which is immutable, they throw aside all reverence, and affirm that God

foreknew and foresaw that His Son would not rebel against Him, and that He therefore
chose Him in preference to all others. They likewise assert that He was not chosen because
He had by nature any thing superior to the other sons of God; for no man, say they, is son
of God by nature, nor has any peculiar relation to Him. He was chosen, they allege, because,
though mutable by nature, His painstaking character suffered no deterioration. As though,
forsooth, even if a Paul and a Peter made like endeavours, their sonship would in no respects
differ from His.</p>
<p>“To establish this insane doctrine they insult the Scriptures, and bring forward what is
said in the Psalms of Christ, ‘Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore thy
God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows260.’ Now that the Son of
God was not created out of the non-existent261, and that there never was a time in which
He was not, is expressly taught by John the Evangelist, who speaks of Him as ‘the only begotten
Son which is in the bosom of the Father262.’ This divine teacher desired to show that the
Father and the Son are inseparable; and, therefore, he said, ‘that the Son is in the bosom of
the Father.’ Moreover, the same John affirms that the Word of God is not classed among
things created out of the non-existent, for, he says that ‘all things were made by Him263,’
and he also declares His individual personality264 in the following words: ‘In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<gap reason="omitted"/>All things were made
by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made265.’ If, then, all things were
made by Him, how is it that He who thus bestowed existence on all, could at any period
have had no existence himself? The Word, the creating power, can in no way be defined as
of the same nature as the things created, if indeed He was in the beginning, and all things
were made by Him, and were called by Him out of the non-existent into being. ‘That which
is266’ must be of an opposite nature to, and essentially different from, things created out of
the non-existent. This shows, likewise, that there is no separation between the Father and
the Son, and that the idea of separation cannot even be conceived by the mind; while the
fact that the world was created out of the non-existent involves a later and fresh genesis of
its essential nature267, all things having been endowed with such an origin of existence by

the Father through the Son. John, the most pious apostle, perceiving that the word ‘was’
applied to the Word of God268 was far beyond and above the intelligence of created beings,
did not presume to speak of His generation or creation, nor yet dared to name the Maker
and the creature in equivalent syllables. Not that the Son of God is unbegotten, for the
Father alone is unbegotten; but that the ineffable personality of the only-begotten God is
beyond the keenest conception of the evangelists and perhaps even of angels. Therefore, I
do not think men ought to be considered pious who presume to investigate this subject, in
disobedience to the injunction, ‘Seek not what is too difficult for thee, neither enquire into
what is too high for thee269.’ For if the knowledge of many other things incomparably inferior
is beyond the capacity of the human mind, and cannot therefore be attained, as has been
said by Paul, ‘Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him270,’ and as God also said to Abunder.
<note type="footnote">Hence, materially, it means in (i) Classical Greek, sediment, prop. foundation: substances as opposed to
their reflexions, substantial nature, as of timber [Theoph. C. P. 5. 16. 4]. So naturally grew the signification of
ground of hope, actual existence; and, in the later philosophy, it had come to be employed instead of οὐσία for
the noetic substratum “underlying” the phænomena. (ii) Scriptural. In the N.T. it is found five times, twice in
2 Cor. and thrice in Heb. (α) 2 Cor. ix. 4, and (β) xi. 17. “Confidence” of boasting. (γ) Heb. i. 3, ὁ χαρακτὴρ τῆς
ὑποστάσεως, A.V. the express image of His “person.” R.V., the very image of His “substance.” (δ) Heb. iii. 14,
“Confidence”. (ε) Heb. xi. 1, A.V. “substance” of things hoped for. R.V. Assurance of things hoped for. (iii) Ecclesiastical.
The earlier ecclesiastical use, like the later philosophical, identified it with οὐσία, and so the Nicene
Confession anathematized those who maintained the Son to be of a different substance or essence from the
Father (ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας). In the version of Hilary of Poictiers (de Synodis, §84; Op. ii. 510) οὐσία is
translated by “substantia,” the etymological equivalent of ὑπόστασις, except in the phrase quoted, when “substantia
aut essentia” represents οὐσία by its own etymological equivalent “essentia.” Thus in a.d. 325 to have
contended for τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις would have been heretical. But as the subtilty of controversy required greater
nicety of phrase, it was laid down (Basil the Great, Ep. 38) that while οὐσία is an universal denoting that which
is common to the individuals of a species, ὑπόστασις makes an individual that which it is, and constitutes personal
existence. Hence μία ὑπόστασις became Sabellian, and τρεῖς οὐσίαι Arian, while τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις was
orthodox. cf Theod. Dial. i. 7. Eranistes loq. “Is there any distinction between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις?” Orthodoxus.
“In extra-Christian philosophy there is not; for οὐσία signifies τὸ ὄν, that which is, and ὑπόστασις that which subsists.
But according to the doctrine of the Fathers there is the same difference between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις as between the
common and the particular; the race, and the species or individual.”…“The Divine οὐσία (substance) means the Holy
Trinity; but the ὑπόστασις indicates any πρόσωπον (person) as of the Father, the Son, or of the Holy Ghost. For we who
follow the definitions of the Fathers assert ὑπόστασις, πρόσωπον and ἰδιότης (substantial nature, person, or individuality)
to mean the same thing.” Vide also Newman’s Arians of the Fourth Century, Appendix, Note iv. fourth Edition.</note>

raham, that the stars could not be numbered by him271; and it is likewise said, ‘Who shall
number the grains of sand by the sea-shore, or the drops of rain272?’ how then can any one
but a madman presume to enquire into the nature of the Word of God? It is said by the
Spirit of prophecy, ‘Who shall declare His generation273?’ And, therefore, our Saviour in His
kindness to those men who were the pillars of the whole world, desiring to relieve them of
the burden of striving after this knowledge, told them that it was beyond their natural
comprehension, and that the Father alone could discern this most divine mystery; ‘No man,’
said He, ‘knoweth the Son but the Father, and no man knoweth the Father save the Son274.’
It was, I think, concerning this same subject that the Father said, ‘My secret is for Me and
for Mine275.’</p>
<p>“But the insane folly of imagining that the Son of God came into being out of that which
had no being, and that His sending forth took place in time, is plain from the words ‘which
had no being,’ although the foolish are incapable of perceiving the folly of their own utterances.
For the phrase ‘He was not’ must either have reference to time, or to some interval
in the ages. If then it be true that all things were made by Him, it is evident that every age,
time, all intervals of time, and that ‘when’ in which ‘was not’ has its place, were made by
Him. And is it not absurd to say that there was a time when He who created all time, and
ages, and seasons, with which the ‘was not’ is confused, was not? For it would be the height
of ignorance, and contrary indeed to all reason, to affirm that the cause of any created thing
can be posterior to that caused by it. The interval during which they say the Son was still
unbegotten of the Father was, according to their opinion, prior to the wisdom of God, by
whom all things were created. They thus contradict the Scripture which declares Him to be
‘the firstborn of every creature276.’ In consonance with this doctrine, Paul with his usual
mighty voice cries concerning Him; ‘whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom
also He made the worlds277 ’ ‘For by Him were all things created that are in heaven, and that
are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers: all things were created by Him and for Him: and He is before all things278 ’ Since the

hypothesis implied in the phrase ‘out of the non-existent’ is manifestly impious, it follows
that the Father is always Father. And He is Father from the continual presence of the Son,
on account of whom He is called279 Father. And the Son being ever present with Him, the
Father is ever perfect, wanting in no good thing, for He did not beget His only Son in time,
or in any interval of time, nor out of that which had no previous existence.</p>
<p>“Is it not then impious to say that there was a time when the wisdom of God was not?
Who saith, ‘I was by Him as one brought up with Him: I was daily His delight280?’ Or that
once the power of God was not, or His Word, or anything else by which the Son is known,
or the Father designated, defective? To assert that the brightness of the Father’s glory ‘once
did not exist,’ destroys also the original light of which it is the brightness281; and if there
ever was a time in which the image of God was not, it is plain that He Whose image He is,
is not always: nay, by the non-existence of the express image of God’s Person, He also is
taken away of whom this is ever the express image. Hence it may be seen, that the Sonship
of our Saviour has not even anything in common with the sonship of men. For just as it has
been shown that the nature of His existence cannot be expressed by language, and infinitely
surpasses in excellence all things to which He has given being, so His Sonship, naturally
partaking in His paternal Divinity, is unspeakably different from the sonship of those who,
by His appointment, have been adopted as sons. He is by nature immutable, perfect, and
all-sufficient, whereas men are liable to change, and need His help. What further advance
can be made by the wisdom of God282? What can the Very Truth, or God the Word, add
to itself? How can the Life or the True Light in any way be bettered? And is it not still more
contrary to nature to suppose that wisdom can be susceptible of folly? that the power of
God can be united with weakness? that reason itself can be dimmed by unreasonableness,
or that darkness can be mixed with the true light? Does not the Apostle say, ‘What communion
hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial283?’ and Solomon,
that ‘the way of a serpent upon a rock284 ’ was ‘too wonderful’ for the human mind to comprehend,
which ‘rock,’ according to St. Paul, is Christ285. Men and angels, however, who
are His creatures, have received His blessing, enabling them to exercise themselves in virtue
and in obedience to His commands, that thus they may avoid sin. And it is on this account

that our Lord being by nature the Son of the Father, is worshipped by all; and they who have
put off the spirit of bondage, and by brave deeds and advance in virtue have received the
spirit of adoption through the kindness of Him Who is the Son of God by nature, by adoption
also become sons.</p>
<p>“His true, peculiar, natural, and special Sonship was declared by Paul, who, speaking
of God, says, that ‘He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us286,’ who are not
by nature His sons. It was to distinguish Him from those who are not ‘His own,’ that he
called Him ‘His own son.’ It is also written in the Gospel, ‘This is My beloved Son in whom
I am well pleased287;’ and in the Psalms the Saviour says, ‘The Lord said unto Me, Thou art
My Son288.’ By proclaiming natural sonship He shows that there are no other natural sons
besides Himself.</p>
<p>“And do not these words, I begot thee ‘from the womb before the morning289,’ plainly
show the natural sonship of the paternal birth290 of One whose lot it is, not from diligence
of conduct, or exercise in moral progress, but by individuality of nature? Hence it ensues
that the filiation of the only-begotten Son of the Father is incapable of fall; while the adoption
of reasonable beings who are not His sons by nature, but merely on account of fitness of
character, and by the bounty of God, may fall away, as it is written in the word, ‘The sons of
God saw the daughters of men, and took them as wives,’ and so forth291. And God, speaking
by Isaiah, said, ‘I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against
Me292.’</p>

<p>“And now amongst us there have sprung up, ‘out of the non-existent’ men who have
greedily sucked down the dregs of this impiety, offsets of the same stock: I mean Arius and
Achillas, and all their gang of rogues. Three bishops296 of Syria, appointed no one knows
how, by consenting to them, fire them to more fatal heat. I refer their sentence to your decision.
Retaining in their memory all that they can collect concerning the suffering, humiliation,
emptying of Himself297, and so-called poverty, and everything of which the Saviour
for our sake accepted the acquired name, they bring forward those passages to disprove His
eternal existence and divinity, while they forget all those which declare His glory and nobility
and abiding with the Father; as for instance, ‘I and My father are one298.’ In these words the
Lord does not proclaim Himself to be the Father, neither does He represent two natures as
one; but that the essence of the Son of the Father preserves accurately the likeness of the
Father, His nature taking off the impress of likeness to Him in all things, being the exact
image of the Father and the express stamp of the prototype. When, therefore, Philip, desirous
of seeing the Father, said to Him, ‘Lord, show us the Father,’ the Lord with abundant plainness
said to him, ‘He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father299,’ as though the Father were beheld
in the spotless and living mirror of His image. The same idea is conveyed in the Psalms,
where the saints say, ‘In Thy light we shall see light300.’ It is on this account that ‘he who
honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father301.’ And rightly, for every impious word which
men dare to utter against the Son is spoken also against the Father.</p>

us. They think it beneath them to be compared with any of those of old time, nor do they
endure to be put on a par with the teachers we have been conversant with from childhood.
They will not admit that any of our fellow-ministers anywhere possess even mediocrity of
intelligence. They say that they themselves alone are the wise and the poor, and discoverers
of doctrines, and to them alone have been revealed those truths which, say they, have never
entered the mind of any other individuals under the sun. O what wicked arrogance! O what
excessive folly! What false boasting, joined with madness and Satanic pride, has hardened
their impious hearts! They are not ashamed to oppose the godly clearness of the ancient
scriptures, nor yet does the unanimous piety of all our fellow-ministers concerning Christ
blunt their audacity. Even devils will not suffer impiety like this; for even they refrain from
speaking blasphemy against the Son of God.</p>
<p>“These then are the questions I have to raise, according to the ability I possess, with
those who from their rude resources throw dust on the Christ, and try to slander our reverence
for Him. These inventors of silly tales assert that we, who reject their impious and unscriptural
blasphemy concerning the creation of Christ from the non-existent, teach that
there are two unbegotten Beings. For these ill-instructed men contend that one of these alternatives
must hold; either He must be believed to have come out of the non-existent, or
there are two unbegotten Beings. In their ignorance and want of practice in theology they
do not realize how vast must be the distance between the Father who is uncreate, and the
creatures, whether rational or irrational, which He created out of the non-existent; and that
the only-begotten nature of Him Who is the Word of God, by Whom the Father created
the universe out of the non-existent, standing, as it were, in the middle between the two,
was begotten of the self-existent Father, as the Lord Himself testified when He said, ‘Every
one that loveth the Father, loveth also the Son that is begotten of Him302.’</p>
<p>“We believe, as is taught by the apostolical Church, in an only unbegotten Father, Who
of His being hath no cause, immutable and invariable, and Who subsists always in one state
of being, admitting neither of progression nor of diminution; Who gave the law, and the
prophets, and the gospel; of patriarchs and apostles, and of all saints, Lord: and in one Lord
Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten not out of that which is not, but of the
Father, Who is; yet not after the manner of material bodies, by severance or emanation, as
Sabellius303 and Valentinus304 taught; but in an inexpressible and inexplicable manner,
according to the saying which we quoted above, ‘Who shall declare His generation305?’ since

be comprehended, because the nature of reasonable beings is unable to grasp the manner
in which He was begotten of the Father306.</p>
<p>“But those who are led by the Spirit of truth have no need to learn these things of me,
for the words long since spoken by the Saviour yet sound in our ears, ‘No one knoweth who
the Father is but the Son, and no one knoweth who the Son is but the Father307.’ We have
learnt that the Son is immutable and unchangeable, all-sufficient and perfect, like the Father,
lacking only His “unbegotten.” He is the exact and precisely similar image of His Father.
For it is clear that the image fully contains everything by which the greater likeness exists,
as the Lord taught us when He said, ‘My Father is greater than I308.’ And in accordance with
this we believe that the Son always existed of the Father; for he is the brightness of His glory,
and the express image of His Father’s Person309.” But let no one be led by the word ‘always’
to imagine that the Son is unbegotten, as is thought by some who have their intellects blinded:
for to say that He was, that He has always been, and that before all ages, is not to say that
He is unbegotten.</p>
<p>“The mind of man could not possibly invent a term expressive of what is meant by being
unbegotten. I believe that you are of this opinion; and, indeed, I feel confident in your or-
thodox view that none of these terms in any way signify the unbegotten. For all the terms
appear to signify merely the extension of time, and are not adequate to express the divinity
and, as it were, the primæval being of the only-begotten Son. They were used by the holy
men who earnestly endeavoured to clear up the mystery, and who asked pardon from those
who heard them, with a reasonable excuse for their failure, by saying ‘as far as our comprehension
has reached.’ But if those who allege that what was ‘known in part’ has been ‘done
away310’ for them, expect from human lips anything beyond human powers, it is plain that
the terms ‘was,’ and ‘ever,’ and ‘before all ages,’ fall far short of this expectation. But whatever
they may mean, it is not the same as ‘the unbegotten.’ Therefore His own individual dignity
must be reserved to the Father as the Unbegotten One, no one being called the cause of His
existence: to the Son likewise must be given the honour which befits Him, there being to
Him a generation from the Father which has no beginning; we must render Him worship,
as we have already said, only piously and religiously ascribing to Him the ‘was’ and the
‘ever,’ and the ‘before all ages;’ not however rejecting His divinity, but ascribing to Him a
perfect likeness in all things to His Father, while at the same time we ascribe to the Father

alone His own proper glory of ‘the unbegotten,’ even as the Saviour Himself says, ‘My
Father is greater than I311.’</p>
<p>“And in addition to this pious belief respecting the Father and the Son, we confess as
the Sacred Scriptures teach us, one Holy Ghost, who moved the saints of the Old Testament,
and the divine teachers of that which is called the New. We believe in one only Catholic
Church, the apostolical, which cannot be destroyed even though all the world were to take
counsel to fight against it, and which gains the victory over all the impious attacks of the
heterodox; for we are emboldened by the words of its Master, ‘Be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world312.’ After this, we receive the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead,
of which Jesus Christ our Lord became the first-fruits; Who bore a Body, in truth, not in
semblance, derived from Mary the mother of God313; in the fulness of time sojourning
among the race, for the remission of sins: who was crucified and died, yet for all this suffered
no diminution of His Godhead. He rose from the dead, was taken into heaven, and sat down
at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</p>

wearisome to dwell minutely on each article, since they are well known to your pious diligence.
These things we teach, these things we preach; these are the dogmas of the apostolic

<p>“Arius and Achillas, together with their fellow foes, have been expelled from the Church,
because they have become aliens from our pious doctrine: according to the blessed Paul,
who said, ‘If any of you preach any other gospel than that which you have received, let him
be accursed, even though he should pretend to be an angel from heaven314, and ‘But if any
man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing315,’
and so forth. Since, then, they have been condemned by the brotherhood, let none of you
receive them, nor attend to what they say or write. They are deceivers, and propagate lies,
and they never adhere to the truth. They go about to different cities with no other intent
than to deliver letters under the pretext of friendship and in the name of peace, and by hypocrisy
and flattery to obtain other letters in return, in order to deceive a few ‘silly women
who are laden with sins316.’ I beseech you, beloved brethren, to avoid those who have thus

have eagerly sought to make a display before judicial tribunals, who have endeavoured to
excite a persecution against us at a period of the most entire peace, and who have enervated
the unspeakable mystery of the generation of Christ. Unite unanimously in opposition to

likewise, I trust, will follow. Many kindly attempts have been made by me to gain back those

who have been deceived by them and leading them to repentance, than the manifestation

<p>Alexander wrote in the same strain to Philogonius318, bishop of Antioch, to Eustathius319,
who then ruled the church of the Beroeans, and to all those who defended the doctrines
of the Apostles. But Arius could not endure to keep quiet, but wrote to all those whom he
believed to agree with him in opinion. His letter to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, is a clear
proof that the divine Alexander wrote nothing that was false concerning him. I shall here

<p>“To his very dear lord, the man of God, the faithful and orthodox Eusebius, Arius, unjustly
persecuted by Alexander the Pope320, on account of that all-conquering truth of which
you also are a champion, sendeth greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“Ammonius, my father, being about to depart for Nicomedia, I considered myself bound
to salute you by him, and withal to inform that natural affection which you bear towards
the brethren for the sake of God and His Christ, that the bishop greatly wastes and persecutes
us, and leaves no stone unturned321 against us. He has driven us out of the city as atheists,
because we do not concur in what he publicly preaches, namely, God always, the Son always;
as the Father so the Son; the Son co-exists unbegotten with God; He is everlasting; neither
by thought nor by any interval does God precede the Son; always God, always Son; he is
begotten of the unbegotten; the Son is of God Himself. Eusebius, your brother bishop of
Cæsarea, Theodotus, Paulinus, Athanasius, Gregorius, Aetius, and all the bishops of the
East, have been condemned because they say that God had an existence prior to that of His
Son; except Philogonius, Hellanicus, and Macarius, who are unlearned men, and who have
embraced heretical opinions. Some of them say that the Son is an eructation, others that He
is a production, others that He is also unbegotten. These are impieties to which we cannot
listen, even though the heretics threaten us with a thousand deaths. But we say and believe,
and have taught, and do teach, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor in any way part of the
unbegotten; and that He does not derive His subsistence from any matter; but that by His
own will and counsel He has subsisted before time, and before ages, as perfect God, only
begotten and unchangeable, and that before He was begotten, or created, or purposed, or
established, He was not. For He was not unbegotten. We are persecuted, because we say
that the Son has a beginning, but that God is without beginning. This is the cause of our
persecution, and likewise, because we say that He is of the non-existent322. And this we say,
because He is neither part of God, nor of any essential being323. For this are we persecuted;

Hellanicus, of Tripolis, and Macarius, of Jerusalem. He spread calumnies against them because
they said that the Son is eternal, existing before all ages, of equal honour and of the

this alone would not be fatal to the brotherhood, for Seneca (Ep. Mor. 104), calls his brother Gallio dominus.

Theodotus, bishop of Laodicea, Syria, (not the Phrygian Laodicea of the Apocalypse), was a Physician
of the body was well as of the soul (Euseb. H.E. vii. 32). Paulinus, bishop first of Tyre, and then of Antioch for

of Cæsarea). Athanasius, bishop of Anazarbus, an important town of Cilicia Campestris, is accused of dangerous
Arianism by his great namesake. (Athan. de Synod, 584.) Gregorius succeeded Eusebius of Nicomedia at Berytus
(Beyrout), on the translation of the latter to Nicomedia. Aetius, Bishop of Lydda, (the Lydda of the Acts, on the
plain of Sharon, now Ludd, the city of El-Khudr, who is identified with St. George), died soon after the Arian
Synod of Antioch, a.d. 330 (Philost. H.E. iii. 12), and is to be distinguished from the arch-Arian Aetius, Julian’s
friend, who survived till a.d. 367 (Phil. H.E. ix. 6). Philogonius was raised to the episcopate per saltum, like St.
Ambrose (Chrysost. Orat. 71, tom. v. p. 507), he preceded the Arian Paulinus. Hellanicus was present at Nicæa,
but was driven from the See of Tripolis, in Phoenicia, by the Arians (Athan. Hist. Ar. ad Mon. §5). Macarius is

<head>Chapter V.—The Letter of Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia, to Paulinus, Bishop of Tyre.</head>
<p>“To my lord Paulinus, Eusebius sendeth greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“The zeal of my lord Eusebius in the cause of the truth, and likewise your silence concerning
it, have not failed to reach our ears. Accordingly, if, on the one hand, we rejoiced
on account of the zeal of my lord Eusebius; on the other we are grieved at you, because even
the silence of such a man appears like a defeat of our cause. Hence, as it behoves not a wise
man to be of a different opinion from others, and to be silent concerning the truth, stir up,
I exhort you, within yourself the spirit of wisdom to write, and at length begin what may be
profitable to yourself and to others, specially if you consent to write in accordance with
Scripture, and tread in the tracks of its words and will.</p>
<p>“We have never heard that there are two unbegotten beings, nor that one has been divided
into two, nor have we learned or believed that it has ever undergone any change of a
corporeal nature; but we affirm that the unbegotten is one and one also that which exists in
truth by Him, yet was not made out of His substance, and does not at all participate in the
nature or substance of the unbegotten, entirely distinct in nature and in power, and made
after perfect likeness both of character and power to the maker. We believe that the mode
of His beginning not only cannot be expressed by words but even in thought, and is incomprehensible
not only to man, but also to all beings superior to man. These opinions we advance
not as having derived them from our own imagination, but as having deduced them
from Scripture, whence we learn that the Son was created, established, and begotten in the
same substance and in the same immutable and inexpressible nature as the Maker; and so
the Lord says, ‘God created me in the beginning of His way; I was set up from everlasting;
before the hills was I brought forth328.’</p>
<p>“If He had been from Him or of Him, as a portion of Him, or by an emanation of His
substance, it could not be said that He was created or established; and of this you, my lord,
are certainly not ignorant. For that which is of the unbegotten could not be said to have
been created or founded, either by Him or by another, since it is unbegotten from the beginning.
But if the fact of His being called the begotten gives any ground for the belief that,
having come into being of the Father’s substance, He also has from the Father likeness of
nature, we reply that it is not of Him alone that the Scriptures have spoken as begotten, but
that they also thus speak of those who are entirely dissimilar to Him by nature. For of men
it is said, ‘I have begotten and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me329;’ and in
another place, ‘Thou hast forsaken God who begat thee330;’ and again it is said, ‘Who begat

<pb n="90"/>
the drops of dew331?’ This expression does not imply that the dew partakes of the nature of
God, but simply that all things were formed according to His will. There is, indeed, nothing
which is of His substance, yet every thing which exists has been called into being by His
will. He is God; and all things were made in His likeness, and in the future likeness of His
Word, being created of His free will. All things were made by His means by God. All things
are of God.</p>
<p>“When you have received my letter, and have revised it according to the knowledge and
grace given you by God, I beg you will write as soon as possible to my lord Alexander. I feel
confident that if you would write to him, you would succeed in bringing him over to your
opinion. Salute all the brethren in the Lord. May you, my lord, be preserved by the grace of
God, and be led to pray for us.”</p>
<p>It is thus that they wrote to each other, in order to furnish one another with weapons
against the truth332. And so when the blasphemous doctrine had been disseminated in the
churches of Egypt and of the East, disputes and contentions arose in every city, and in every
village, concerning theological dogmas. The common people looked on, and became judges
of what was said on either side, and some applauded one party, and some the other. These
were, indeed, scenes fit for the tragic stage, over which tears might have been shed. For it
was not, as in bygone days, when the church was attacked by strangers and by enemies, but
now natives of the same country, who dwelt under one roof, and sat down at one table,
fought against each other not with spears, but with their tongues. And what was still more
sad, they who thus took up arms against one another were members of one another, and
belonged to one body.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—General Council of Nicæa.</head>
<p>The emperor, who possessed the most profound wisdom, having heard of these things,
endeavoured, as a first step, to stop up their fountain-head. He therefore despatched a
messenger renowned for his ready wit to Alexandria with letters, in the endeavour to extinguish
the dispute, and expecting to reconcile the disputants. But his hopes having been
frustrated, he proceeded to summon the celebrated council of Nicæa333; and pledged his
word that the bishops and their officials should be furnished with asses, mules, and horses
for their journey at the public expense. When all those who were capable of enduring the
fatigue of the journey had arrived at Nicæa, he went thither himself, with both the wish of
seeing the multitude of bishops, and the yearning desire of maintaining unanimity amongst
them. He at once arranged that all their wants should be liberally supplied. Three hundred
and eighteen bishops were assembled. The bishop of Rome334, on account of his very advanced
age, was absent, but he sent two presbyters335 to the council, with authority to agree
to what was done.</p>
<p>At this period many individuals were richly endowed with apostolical gifts; and many,
like the holy apostle, bore in their bodies the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ336. James,
bishop of Antioch, a city of Mygdonia, which is called Nisibis by the Syrians and Assyrians,
raised the dead and restored them to life, and performed many other wonders which it
would be superfluous to mention again in detail in this history, as I have already given an
account of them in my work, entitled “Philotheus337.” Paul, bishop of Neo-Cæsarea, a
fortress situated on the banks of the Euphrates, had suffered from the frantic rage of Licinius.
He had been deprived of the use of both hands by the application of a red-hot iron, by which
the nerves which give motion to the muscles had been contracted and rendered dead. Some
had had the right eye dug out, others had lost the right arm. Among these was Paphnutius
of Egypt. In short, the Council looked like an assembled army of martyrs. Yet this holy and
celebrated gathering was not entirely free from the element of opposition; for there were
some, though so few as easily to be reckoned, of fair surface, like dangerous shallows, who
really, though not openly, supported the blasphemy of Arius.</p>

<pb n="92"/>
<p>When they were all assembled338, the emperor ordered a great hall to be prepared for
their accommodation in the palace, in which a sufficient number of benches and seats were
placed; and having thus arranged that they should be treated with becoming dignity, he
desired the bishops to enter in, and discuss the subjects proposed. The emperor, with a few
attendants, was the last to enter the room; remarkable for his lofty stature, and worthy of
admiration for personal beauty, and for the still more marvellous modesty which dwelt on
his countenance. A low stool was placed for him in the middle of the assembly, upon which,
however, he did not seat himself until he had asked the permission of the bishops. Then all
the sacred assembly sat down around him. Then forthwith rose first the great Eustathius,
bishop of Antioch, who, upon the translation of Philogonius, already referred to, to a better
life, had been compelled reluctantly to become his successor by the unanimous suffrages of
the bishops, priests, and of the Christ-loving laity. He crowned the emperor’s head with the
flowers of panegyric, and commended the diligent attention he had manifested in the regulation
of ecclesiastical affairs.</p>
<p>The excellent emperor next exhorted the Bishops to unanimity and concord; he recalled
to their remembrance the cruelty of the late tyrants, and reminded them of the honourable
peace which God had, in his reign and by his means, accorded them. He pointed out how
dreadful it was, aye, very dreadful, that at the very time when their enemies were destroyed,
and when no one dared to oppose them, they should fall upon one another, and make their
amused adversaries laugh, especially as they were debating about holy things, concerning
which they had the written teaching of the Holy Spirit. “For the gospels” (continued he),
“the apostolical writings, and the oracles of the ancient prophets, clearly teach us what we
ought to believe concerning the divine nature. Let, then, all contentious disputation be discarded;
and let us seek in the divinely-inspired word the solution of the questions at issue.”
These and similar exhortations he, like an affectionate son, addressed to the bishops as to
fathers, labouring to bring about their unanimity in the apostolical doctrines. Most members
of the synod, won over by his arguments, established concord among themselves, and embraced
sound doctrine. There were, however, a few, of whom mention has been already
made, who opposed these doctrines, and sided with Arius; and amongst them were Menophantus,
bishop of Ephesus, Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis, Theognis, bishop of Nicæa,
and Narcissus, bishop of Neronias, which is a town of the second Cilicia, and is now called
Irenopolis; also Theonas, bishop of Marmarica, and Secundus, bishop of Ptolemais in
Egypt339. They drew up a formulary of their faith, and presented it to the council. As soon

the uproar raised against them, and so many were the reproaches cast on them for having
betrayed religion, that they all, with the exception of Secundus and Theonas, stood up and
took the lead in publicly renouncing Arius. This impious man, having thus been expelled
from the Church, a confession of faith which is received to this day was drawn up by unanimous
consent; and, as soon as it was signed, the council was dissolved.</p>

part in the Arian movement: Athanasius says that he was thrice degraded by different synods, and is the worst
of the Eusebians (Ath. Ap. de fuga, sec. 28). Marmarica is not a town, but a district. It lay west of Egypt, about
the modern Barca. There were two cities in Egypt named Ptolemais, one in Upper Egypt below Abydos; one a
port of the Red Sea. After the time of Constantine, Cilicia was divided into three districts; Cilicia Prima, with Tarsus
for chief town; Secunda, with Anazarbus; Tertia, with Seleuceia.</note>

<head>Chapter VII.—Confutation of Arianism deduced from the Writings of Eustathius and Athanasius.</head>
<p>The above-named bishops, however, did not consent to it in sincerity, but only in appearance.
This was afterwards shewn by their plotting against those who were foremost in
zeal for religion, as well as by what these latter have written about them. For instance, Eustathius,
the famous bishop of Antioch, who has been already mentioned, when explaining
the text in the Proverbs, ‘The Lord created me in the beginning of His way, before His works
of old340,’ wrote against them, and refuted their blasphemy.</p>
<p>341 “I will now proceed to relate how these different events occurred. A general council
was summoned at Nicæa, and about two hundred and seventy bishops were convened.
There were, however, so many assembled that I cannot state their exact number, neither,
indeed, have I taken any great trouble to ascertain this point. When they began to inquire
into the nature of the faith, the formulary of Eusebius was brought forward, which contained
undisguised evidence of his blasphemy. The reading of it before all occasioned great grief
to the audience, on account of its departure from the faith, while it inflicted irremediable
shame on the writer. After the Eusebian gang had been clearly convicted, and the impious
writing had been torn up in the sight of all, some amongst them by concert, under the pretence
of preserving peace, imposed silence on all the ablest speakers. The Ariomaniacs,
fearing lest they should be ejected from the Church by so numerous a council of bishops,
sprang forward to anathematize and condemn the doctrines condemned, and unanimously
signed the confession of faith. Thus having retained possession of their episcopal seats
through the most shameful deception, although they ought rather to have been degraded,
they continue, sometimes secretly, and sometimes openly, to patronize the condemned
doctrines, plotting against the truth by various arguments. Wholly bent upon establishing
these plantations of tares, they shrink from the scrutiny of the intelligent, avoid the observant,
and attack the preachers of godliness. But we do not believe that these atheists can ever thus
overcome the Deity. For though they ‘gird themselves’ they ‘shall be broken in pieces,’ according
to the solemn prophecy of Isaiah342.”</p>
<p>These are the words of the great Eustathius. Athanasius, his fellow combatant, the
champion of the truth, who succeeded the celebrated Alexander in the episcopate, added
the following, in a letter addressed to the Africans.</p>
<note type="footnote">340 Prov. viii. 22, lxx. Κύριος ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἔργα αὐτοῦ</note>

<p>“The bishops convened in council being desirous of refuting the impious assertions invented
by the Arians, that the Son was created out of that which was non-existent343, that
He is a creature and created being344, that there was a period in which He was not345, and
that He is mutable by nature, and being all agreed in propounding the following declarations,
which are in accordance with the holy Scriptures; namely, that the Son is by nature onlybegotten
of God, Word, Power, and sole Wisdom of the Father; that He is, as John said, ‘the
true God346,’ and, as Paul has written, ‘the brightness of the glory, and the express image
of the person of the Father347,’ the followers of Eusebius, drawn aside by their own vile
doctrine, then began to say one to another, Let us agree, for we are also of God; ‘There is
but one God, by whom are all things348; ‘Old things are passed away; behold, all things are
become new, and all things are of God349.’ They also dwelt particularly upon what is contained
in ‘The Shepherd350:’ ‘Believe above all that there is one God, who created and fashioned
all things, and making them to be out of that which is not.’</p>
<p>“But the bishops saw through their evil design and impious artifice, and gave a clearer
elucidation of the words ‘of God,’ and wrote, that the Son is of the substance of God; in order
that while the creatures, which do not in any way derive their existence of or from themselves,
are said to be of God, the Son alone is said to be of the substance of the Father; this being
peculiar to the only-begotten Son, the true Word of the Father. This is the reason why the
bishops wrote, that He is of the substance of the Father.</p>
<p>“But when the Arians, who seemed few in number, were again interrogated by the
Bishops as to whether they admitted ‘that the Son is not a creature, but Power, and sole
Wisdom, and eternal unchangeable351 Image of the Father; and that He is very God,’ the
Eusebians were noticed making signs to one another to shew that these declarations were
equally applicable to us. For it is said, that we are ‘the image and glory of God352;’ and ‘for
always we who live353:’ there are, also, they said, many powers; for it is written—‘All the

power of God went out of the land of Egypt354.’ The canker-worm and the locust are said to
be ‘a great power355.’ And elsewhere it is written, The God of powers is with us, the God of
Jacob helper356.’ To which may be added that we are God’s own not simply, but because the
Son called us ‘brethren357.’ The declaration that Christ is ‘the true God’ does not distress
us, for, having come into being, He is true.</p>
<p>“Such was the corrupt opinion of the Arians; but on this the bishops, having detected
their deceitfulness in this matter, collected from Scripture those passages which say of Christ
that He is the glory, the fountain, the stream, and the express image of the person; and they
quoted the following words: ‘In thy light we shall see light358;’ and likewise, ‘I and the Father
are one359.’ They then, with still greater clearness, briefly declared that the Son is of one
substance with the Father; for this, indeed, is the signification of the passages which have
been quoted. The complaint of the Arians, that these precise words are not to be found in
Scripture, is proved groundless by their own practice, for their own impious assertions are
not taken from Scripture; for it is not written that the Son is of the non-existent, and that
there was a time when He was not: and yet they complain of having been condemned by
expressions which, though not actually in Scripture, are in accordance with true religion.
They themselves, on the other hand, as though they had found their words on a dunghill,
uttered things verily of earth. The bishops, on the contrary, did not find their expressions
for themselves; but, received their testimony from the fathers, and wrote accordingly. Indeed,
there were bishops of old time, nearly one hundred and thirty years ago, both of the great
city of Rome and of our own city360, who condemned those who asserted that the Son is a
creature, and that He is not of one substance with the Father. Eusebius, the bishop of Cæsarea,
was acquainted with these facts; he, at one time, favoured the Arian heresy, but he afterwards
signed the confession of faith of the Council of Nicæa. He wrote to the people of his diocese,
maintaining that the word ‘consubstantial’ was ‘used by illustrious bishops and learned
writers as a term for expressing the divinity of the Father and of the Son361.’”</p>

<p>So these men concealed their unsoundness through fear of the majority, and gave their
assent to the decisions of the council, thus drawing upon themselves the condemnation of
the prophet, for the God of all cries unto them, “This people honour Me with their lips, but
in their hearts they are far from Me362.” Theonas and Secundus, however, did not like to
take this course, and were excommunicated by common consent as men who esteemed the
Arian blasphemy above evangelical doctrine. The bishops then returned to the council, and
drew up twenty laws to regulate the discipline of the Church.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Facts relating to Meletius the Egyptian, from whom originated the Meletian
Schism, which remains to this day.—Synodical Epistle respecting him.</head>
<p>After Meletius363 had been ordained bishop, which was not long before the Arian controversy,
he was convicted of certain crimes by the most holy Peter, bishop of Alexandria,
who also received the crown of martyrdom. After being deposed by Peter he did not acquiesce
in his deposition, but filled the Thebaid and the adjacent part of Egypt with tumult and
disturbance, and rebelled against the primacy of Alexandria. A letter was written by the
council to the Church of Alexandria, stating what had been decreed against his revolutionary
practices. It was as follows:—</p>
<p>Synodical Epistle.</p>
<p>“To the Church of Alexandria which, by the grace of God, is great and holy, and to the
beloved brethren in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, the bishops who have been convened to
the great and holy council of Nicæa, send greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“The great and holy council of Nicæa having been convened by the grace of God, and
by the most religious emperor, Constantine, who summoned us from different provinces
and cities, we judge it requisite that a letter be sent from the whole Holy Synod to inform
you also what questions have been mooted and debated, and what has been decreed and
established.</p>
<p>“In the first place, the impious doctrines of Arius were investigated before our most
religious emperor Constantine; and his impiety was unanimously anathematized, as well
as the blasphemous language and views which he had propounded, alleging that the Son of
God was out of what was not, that before He was begotten He was not, that there was a
period in which He was not, and that He can, according to His own freewill, be capable
either of virtue or of vice. The holy council anathematized all these assertions, and even refused
so much as to listen to such impious and foolish opinions, and such blasphemous
expressions. The final decision concerning him you already know, or will soon hear; but we
will not mention it now, lest we should appear to trample upon a man who has already received
the recompense due to his sins. Such influence has his impiety obtained as to involve
Theonas, bishop of Marmarica, and Secundus, bishop of Ptolemais, in his ruin, and they
have shared his punishment.</p>
<p>“But after Egypt had, by the grace of God, been delivered from these false and blasphemous
opinions, and from persons who dared to raise discord and division among a hitherto
peaceable people, there yet remained the question of the temerity of Meletius, and of those
ordained by him. We now inform you, beloved brethren, of the decrees of the council on
<note type="footnote">363 Meletius (Μελέτιος), Bishop of Lycopolis, in Upper Egypt, was accused of apostasy. During the Patriarch
Peter’s withdrawal under persecution he intruded into the see of Alexandria. He was deposed in 306.</note>

<pb n="99"/>
this subject. It was decided by the holy council, that Meletius should be treated with clemency,
though, strictly speaking, he was not worthy of even the least concession. He was permitted
to remain in his own city, but was divested of all power, whether of nomination or of ordination,
neither was he to shew himself in any province or city for these purposes: but only to
retain the bare name of his office. Those who had received ordination at his hands were to
submit to a more religious re-ordination; and were to be admitted to communion on the
terms of retaining their ministry, but of ranking in every diocese and church below those
who had been ordained before them by Alexander, our much-honoured fellow-minister.
Thus they would have no power of choosing or nominating others to the ministry, according
to their pleasure, or indeed of doing anything with out the consent of the bishops of the
Catholic and Apostolic Church, who are under Alexander. But they who, by the grace of
God, and in answer to your prayers, have been detected in no schism, and have continued
spotless in the Catholic and Apostolic Church, are to have the power of electing, and of
nominating men worthy of the clerical office, and are permitted to do whatsoever is in accordance
with law and the authority of the Church. If it should happen, that any of those
now holding an office in the Church should die, then let these recently admitted be advanced
to the honours of the deceased, provided only that they appear worthy, and that the people
choose them, and that the election be confirmed and ratified by the catholic bishop of Alexandria.
The same privilege has been conceded to all the others. With respect to Meletius,
however, an exception has been made, both on account of his former insubordination, and
of the rashness and impetuosity of his disposition; for if the least authority were accorded
to him, he might abuse it by again exciting confusion. These are the chief points which relate
to Egypt, and to the holy Church of Alexandria. Whatever other canons were made, or
dogmas decreed, you will hear of them from Alexander, our most-honoured fellow-minister
and brother, who will give you still more accurate information, because he himself directed,
as well as participated in, every thing that took place.</p>
<p>“We also give you the good news that, according to your prayers, the celebration of the
most holy paschal feast was unanimously rectified, so that our brethren of the East, who did
not previously keep the festival at the same time as those of Rome, and as yourselves, and,
indeed, all have done from the beginning, will henceforth celebrate it with you. Rejoice,
then, in the success of our undertakings, and in the general peace and concord, and in the
extirpation of every heresy, and receive with still greater honour and more fervent love,
Alexander, our fellow-minister and your bishop, who imparted joy to us by his presence,
and who, at a very advanced age, has undergone so much fatigue for the purpose of restoring
peace among you. Pray for us all, that what has been rightly decreed may remain steadfast,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, being done, as we trust, according to the good pleasure of
God and the Father in the Holy Ghost, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>

<pb n="100"/>
<p>Notwithstanding the endeavours of that divine assembly of bishops to apply this medicine
to the Meletian disease, vestiges of his infatuation remain even to this day; for there are in
some districts bodies of monks who refuse to follow sound doctrine, and observe certain
vain points of discipline, agreeing with the infatuated views of the Jews and the Samaritans.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Epistle of the Emperor Constantine, concerning the matters transacted at
the Council, addressed to those Bishops who were not present.</head>
<p>The great emperor also wrote an account of the transactions of the council to those
bishops who were unable to attend. And I consider it worth while to insert this epistle in
my work, as it clearly evidences the piety of the writer.</p>
<p>“Constantinus Augustus to the Churches.</p>
<p>“Viewing the common public prosperity enjoyed at this moment, as the result of the
great power of divine grace, I am desirous above all things that the blessed members of the
Catholic Church should be preserved in one faith, in sincere love, and in one form of religion,
towards Almighty God. But, since no firmer or more effective measure could be adopted
to secure this end, than that of submitting everything relating to our most holy religion to
the examination of all, or most of all, the bishops, I convened as many of them as possible,
and took my seat among them as one of yourselves; for I would not deny that truth which
is the source of my greatest joy, namely, that I am your fellow-servant. Every point obtained
its due investigation, until the doctrine pleasing to the all-seeing God, and conducive to
unity, was made clear, so that no room should remain for division or controversy concerning
the faith.</p>
<p>“The commemoration of the most sacred paschal feast being then debated, it was unanimously
decided, that it would be well that it should be everywhere celebrated upon the
same day. What can be more fair, or more seemly, than that that festival by which we have
received the hope of immortality should be carefully celebrated by all, on plain grounds,
with the same order and exactitude? It was, in the first place, declared improper to follow
the custom of the Jews in the celebration of this holy festival, because, their hands having
been stained with crime, the minds of these wretched men are necessarily blinded. By rejecting
their custom, we establish and hand down to succeeding ages one which is more reasonable,
and which has been observed ever since the day of our Lord’s sufferings. Let us, then,
have nothing in common with the Jews, who are our adversaries. For we have received from
our Saviour another way. A better and more lawful line of conduct is inculcated by our holy
religion. Let us with one accord walk therein, my much-honoured brethren, studiously
avoiding all contact with that evil way. They boast that without their instructions we should
be unable to commemorate the festival properly. This is the highest pitch of absurdity. For
how can they entertain right views on any point who, after having compassed the death of
the Lord, being out of their minds, are guided not by sound reason, but by an unrestrained
passion, wherever their innate madness carries them. Hence it follows that they have so far

<pb n="102"/>
lost sight of truth, wandering as far as possible from the correct revisal, that they celebrate
a second Passover in the same year. What motive can we have for following those who are
thus confessedly unsound and in dire error? For we could never tolerate celebrating the
Passover twice in one year. But even if all these facts did not exist, your own sagacity would
prompt you to watch with diligence and with prayer, lest your pure minds should appear
to share in the customs of a people so utterly depraved. It must also be borne in mind, that
upon so important a point as the celebration of a feast of such sanctity, discord is wrong.
One day has our Saviour set apart for a commemoration of our deliverance, namely, of His
most holy Passion. One hath He wished His Catholic Church to be, whereof the members,
though dispersed throughout the most various parts of the world, are yet nourished by one
spirit, that is, by the divine will. Let your pious sagacity reflect how evil and improper it is,
that days devoted by some to fasting, should be spent by others in convivial feasting; and
that after the paschal feast, some are rejoicing in festivals and relaxations, while others give
themselves up to the appointed fasts. That this impropriety should be rectified, and that all
these diversities of commemoration should be resolved into one form, is the will of divine
Providence, as I am convinced you will all perceive. Therefore, this irregularity must be
corrected, in order that we may no more have any thing in common with those parricides
and the murderers of our Lord. An orderly and excellent form of commemoration is observed
in all the churches of the western, of the southern, and of the northern parts of the world,
and by some of the eastern; this form being universally commended, I engaged that you
would be ready to adopt it likewise, and thus gladly accept the rule unanimously adopted
in the city of Rome, throughout Italy, in all Africa, in Egypt, the Spains, the Gauls, the Britains,
Libya, Greece, in the dioceses of Asia, and of Pontus, and in Cilicia, taking into your
consideration not only that the churches of the places above-mentioned are greater in point
of number, but also that it is most pious that all should unanimously agree in that course
which accurate reasoning seems to demand, and which has no single point in common with
the perjury of the Jews.</p>
<p>“Briefly to summarize the whole of the preceding, the judgment of all is, that the holy
Paschal feast should be held on one and the same day; for, in so holy a matter, it is not becoming
that any difference of custom should exist, and it is better to follow the opinion
which has not the least association with error and sin. This being the case, receive with
gladness the heavenly gift and the plainly divine command; for all that is transacted in the
holy councils of the bishops is to be referred to the Divine will. Therefore, when you have
made known to all our beloved brethren the subject of this epistle, regard yourselves bound
to accept what has gone before, and to arrange for the regular observance of this holy day,
so that when, according to my long-cherished desire, I shall see you face to face, I may be
able to celebrate with you this holy festival upon one and the same day; and may rejoice
with you all in witnessing the cruelty of the devil destroyed by our efforts, through Divine

<pb n="103"/>
grace, while our faith and peace and concord flourish throughout the world. May God preserve
you, beloved brethren.”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The daily wants of the Church supplied by the Emperor, and an account of his
other virtues.</head>
<p>Thus did the emperor write to the absent. To those who attended the council, three
hundred and eighteen in number, he manifested great kindness, addressing them with much
gentleness, and presenting them with gifts. He ordered numerous couches to be prepared
for their accommodation and entertained them all at one banquet. Those who were most
worthy he received at his own table, distributing the rest at the others. Observing that some
among them had had the right eye torn out, and learning that this mutilation had been undergone
for the sake of religion, he placed his lips upon the wounds, believing that he would
extract a blessing from the kiss. After the conclusion of the feast, he again presented other
gifts to them. He then wrote to the governors of the provinces, directing that provisionmoney
should be given in every city to virgins and widows, and to those who were consecrated
to the divine service; and he measured the amount of their annual allowance more by
the impulse of his own generosity than by their need. The third part of the sum is distributed
to this day. Julian impiously withheld the whole. His successor364 conferred the sum which
is now dispensed, the famine which then prevailed having lessened the resources of the state.
If the pensions were formerly triple in amount to what they are at present, the generosity
of the emperor can by this fact be easily seen.</p>
<p>I do not account it right to pass over the following circumstance in silence. Some quar-
relsome individuals wrote accusations against certain bishops, and presented their indictments
to the emperor. This occurring before the establishment of concord, he received the
lists, formed them into a packet which he sealed with his ring, and ordered them to be kept
safely. After the reconciliation had been effected, he brought out these writings, and burnt
them in their presence, at the same time declaring upon oath that he had not read a word
of them. He said that the crimes of priests ought not to be made known to the multitude,
lest they should become an occasion of offence, and lead them to sin without fear. It is reported
also that he added that if he were to detect a bishop in the very act of committing
adultery, he would throw his imperial robe over the unlawful deed, lest any should witness
the scene, and be thereby injured. Thus did he admonish all the priests, as well as confer
honours upon them, and then exhorted them to return each to his own flock.</p>

<head>Chapter XI</head>
<p>I shall here insert the letter respecting the faith, written by Eusebius, bishop of Cæsarea,
as it describes the effrontery of the Arians, who not only despise our fathers, but reject their
own: it contains a convincing proof of their madness. They certainly honour Eusebius, because
he adopted their sentiments, but yet they openly contradict his writings. He wrote
this epistle to some of the Arians, who were accusing him, it seems, of treachery. The letter
itself explains the writer’s object.</p>
<p>Epistle of Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea, which he wrote from Nicæa when the great Council
was assembled.</p>
<p>“You will have probably learnt from other sources what was decided respecting the faith
of the church at the general council of Nicæa, for the fame of great transactions generally
outruns the accurate account of them: but lest rumours not in strict accordance with the
truth should reach you, I think it necessary to send to you, first, the formulary of faith originally
proposed by us, and, next, the second, published with additions made to our terms.
The following is our formulary, which was read in the presence of our most pious emperor,
and declared to be couched in right and proper language.</p>
<p>The Faith put forth by us.</p>
<p>“‘As in our first catechetical instruction, and at the time of our baptism, we received
from the bishops who were before us and as we have learnt from the Holy Scriptures, and,
alike as presbyters, and as bishops, were wont to believe and teach; so we now believe and
thus declare our faith. It is as follows:—</p>
<p>“‘We believe in one God, Father Almighty, the Maker of all things, visible and invisible;
and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God, God of God, Light of Light, Life of Life,
Only-begotten Son, First-born of every creature, begotten of the Father before all worlds;
by Whom all things were made; Who for our salvation was incarnate, and lived among
men365. He suffered and rose again the third day, and ascended to the Father; and He will
come again in glory to judge the quick and the dead. We also believe in one Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>“‘We believe in the being and continual existence of each of these; that the Father is in
truth the Father; the Son in truth the Son; the Holy Ghost in truth the Holy Ghost; as our
Lord, when sending out His disciples to preach the Gospel, said, ‘Go forth and teach all nations,
baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost366.’
We positively affirm that we hold this faith, that we have always held it, and that we adhere
<note type="footnote">365 “πολιτευσάμενον.” Cf. Phil. i. 27, and iii. 20, and Acts xxiii. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">366 Matt. xxviii. 19</note>

<pb n="106"/>
to it even unto death, condemning all ungodly heresy. We testify, as before God the Almighty
and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we have thought thus from the heart, and from the soul,
ever since we have known ourselves; and we have the means of showing, and, indeed, of
convincing you, that we have always during the past thus believed and preached.’</p>
<p>“When this formulary had been set forth by us, there was no room to gainsay it; but our
beloved emperor himself was the first to testify that it was most orthodox, and that he coincided
in opinion with it; and he exhorted the others to sign it, and to receive all the doctrine
it contained, with the single addition of the one word—‘consubstantial.’ He explained that
this term implied no bodily condition or change367, for that the Son did not derive His existence
from the Father either by means of division or of abscission, since an immaterial,
intellectual, and incorporeal nature could not be subject to any bodily condition or change368.
These things must be understood as bearing a divine and mysterious signification. Thus
reasoned our wisest and most religious emperor. The addition of the word consubstantial
has given occasion for the composition of the following formulary:—</p>
<p>The Creed published by the Council.</p>
<p>“‘We believe in one God, Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible. And
in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father; only-begotten, that is, of
the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God, begotten
not made, being of one substance with the Father: by Whom all things were made both in
heaven and on earth: Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and
was incarnate, and was made man; He suffered, and rose gain the third day; He ascended
into heaven, and is coming to judge both quick and dead. And we believe in the Holy Ghost.
The holy Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes all who say that there was a time
when the Son of God was not; that before He was begotten He was not; that He was made
out of the non-existent; or that He is of a different essence and of a different substance369
from the Father; and that He is susceptible of variation or change.’</p>
<p>“When they had set forth this formulary, we did not leave without examination that
passage in which it is said that the Son is of the substance of the Father, and consubstantial
with the Father. Questions and arguments thence arose, and the meaning of the terms was
exactly tested. Accordingly they were led to confess that the word consubstantial signifies
that the Son is of the Father, but not as being a part of the Father. We deemed it right to
receive this opinion; for that is sound doctrine which teaches that the Son is of the Father,
but not part of His substance. From the love of peace, and lest we should fall from the true
<note type="footnote">367 πάθη, πάθος</note>
<note type="footnote">368 πάθη, πάθος</note>
<note type="footnote">369 ὑποστάσεως and οὐσίας</note>

<pb n="107"/>
belief, we also accept this view, neither do we reject the term ‘consubstantial.’ For the same
reason we admitted the expression, ‘begotten, but not made;’ for they alleged that the word
‘made’ applies generally to all things which were created by the Son, to which the Son is in
no respect similar; and that consequently He is not a created thing, like the things made by
Him, but is of a substance superior to all created objects. The Holy Scriptures teach Him to
be begotten of the Father, by a mode of generation which is incomprehensible and inexplicable
to all created beings. So also the term ‘of one substance with the Father,’ when investigated,
was accepted not in accordance with bodily relations or similarity to mortal beings.
For it was also shown that it does not either imply division of substance, nor abscission, nor
any modification or change or diminution in the power of the Father, all of which are alien
from the nature of the unbegotten Father. It was concluded that the expression ‘being of one
substance with the Father,’ implies that the Son of God does not resemble, in any one respect,
the creatures which He has made; but that to the Father alone, who begat Him, He is in all
points perfectly like: for He is of the essence and of the substance370 of none save of the
Father. This interpretation having been given of the doctrine, it appeared right to us to assent
to it, especially as we were aware that of the ancients some learned and celebrated bishops
and writers have used the term ‘consubstantial’ with respect to the divinity of the Father
and of the Son.</p>
<p>“These are the circumstances which I had to communicate respecting the published
formulary of the faith. To it we all agreed, not without investigation, but, after having subjected
the views submitted to us to thorough examination in the presence of our most beloved
emperor, for the above reasons we all acquiesced in it. We also allowed that the anathema
appended by them to their formulary of faith should be accepted, because it prohibits the
use of words which are not scriptural; through which almost all the disorder and troubles
of the Church have arisen. And since no passage of the inspired Scripture uses the terms
‘out of the non-existent,’ or that ‘there was a time when He was not,’ nor indeed any of the
other phrases of the same class, it did not appear reasonable to assert or to teach such things.
In this opinion, therefore, we judged it right to agree; since, indeed, we had never, at any
former period, been accustomed to use such terms371. Moreover, the condemnation of the
<note type="footnote">370 ὑποστάσεως and οὐσίας</note>
<note type="footnote">371 The genuineness of the following sentence is doubted. It is not found in Socrates or in Epiphanius. But
it is not unreasonably held by Valesius that Socrates, who seems to have undertaken to clear the character of
Eusebius of all heretical taint, purposely suppressed the passage as inconsistent with orthodoxy. Soc. i. 8. Dr.
Newman writes of this passage, “It is remarkable as shewing his (Constantine’s) utter ignorance of doctrines
which were never intended for discussion among the unbaptized heathen, or the secularized Christian, that, in
spite of bold avowal of the orthodox faith in detail” (i.e. in his letter to Arius), “yet shortly after he explained to
Eusebius one of the Nicene declarations in a sense which even Arius would scarcely have allowed, expressed as
it is almost after the manner of Paulus. “Arians,” 3rd ed., p. 256.</note>

<pb n="108"/>
assertion that before He was begotten He was not, did not appear to involve any incongruity,
because all assent to the fact that He was the Son of God before He was begotten according
to the flesh. And here our emperor, most beloved by God, began to reason concerning His
divine origin, and His existence before all ages. He was virtually in the Father without generation372,
even before He was actually begotten, the Father having always been the Father,
just as He has always been a King and a Saviour, and, virtually, all things, and has never
known any change of being or action.</p>
<p>“We have thought it requisite, beloved brethren, to transmit you an account of these
circumstances, in order to show you what examination and investigation we bestowed on
all the questions which we had to decide; and also to prove how at one time we resisted
firmly, even to the last hour, when doctrines improperly expressed offended us, and, at another
time, we, without contention, accepted the articles which contained nothing objectionable,
when after a thorough and candid investigation of their signification, they appeared
perfectly conformable with what had been confessed by us in the formulary of faith which
we had published.”</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Confutation of the blasphemies of the Arians of our time, from the writings of
Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea.</head>
<p>Eusebius clearly testifies that the aforesaid term “consubstantial” is not a new one, nor
the invention of the fathers assembled at the council; but that, from the very first373 it has
been handed down from father to son. He states that all those then assembled unanimously
received the creed then published; and he again bears testimony to the same fact in another
work, in which he highly extols the conduct of the great Constantine. He writes as follows374:—</p>
<p>“The emperor having delivered this discourse in Latin, it was translated into Greek by
an interpreter, and then he gave liberty of speech to the leaders of the council. Some at once
began to bring forward complaints against their neighbours, while others had recourse to
recriminations and reproaches. Each party had much to urge, and at the beginning the debate
waxed very violent. The emperor patiently and attentively listened to all that was advanced,
and gave full attention to what was urged by each party in turn. He calmly endeavoured to
reconcile the conflicting parties; addressing them mildly in Greek, of which language he
was not ignorant, in a sweet and gentle manner. Some he convinced by argument, others
he put to the blush; he commended those who had spoken well, and excited all to unanimity;
until, at length, he reduced them all to oneness of mind and opinion on all the disputed
points, so that they all agreed to hold the same faith, and to celebrate the festival of Salvation
upon the same day. What had been decided was committed to writing, and was signed by
all the bishops.”</p>
<p>Soon after the author thus continues the narrative:—</p>
<p>“When matters had been thus arranged, the emperor gave them permission to return
to their own dioceses. They returned with great joy, and have ever since continued to be of
the one opinion, agreed upon in the presence of the emperor, and, though once widely
separated, now united together, as it were, in one body. Constantine, rejoicing in the success
of his efforts, made known these happy results by letter to those who were at a distance. He
ordered large sums of money to be liberally distributed both among the inhabitants of the
country and of the cities, in order that the twentieth anniversary of his reign might be celebrated
with public festivities.”</p>
<p>Although the Arians impiously gainsay the statements of the other fathers, yet they
ought to believe what has been written by this father, whom they have been accustomed to
admire. They ought, therefore, to receive his testimony to the unanimity with which the
confession of faith was signed by all. But, since they impugn the opinions of their own
leaders, they ought to become acquainted with the most foul and terrible manner of the

<head>Chapter XIII.—Extract from the Letter of Athanasius on the Death of Arius375.</head>
<p>After Arius had remained a long time in Alexandria, he endeavoured riotously to obtrude
himself again into the assemblies of the Church, professing to renounce his impiety, and
promising to receive the confession of faith drawn up by the fathers. But not succeeding in
obtaining the confidence of the divine Alexander, nor of Athanasius, who followed376 Alex-
ander alike in the patriarchate and in piety, he, helped and encouraged by Eusebius, bishop
of Nicomedia, betook himself to Constantinople. The intrigues upon which he then entered,
and their punishment by the righteous Judge are all best narrated by the excellent Athanasius,
in his letter to Apion377. I shall therefore now insert this passage in my work. He writes:—</p>
<p>“I was not at Constantinople when he died; but Macarius, the presbyter, was there, and
from him I learnt all the circumstances. The emperor Constantine was induced by Eusebius
and his party to send for Arius. Upon his arrival, the emperor asked him whether he held
the faith of the Catholic church. Arius then swore that his faith was orthodox, and presented
a written summary of his belief; concealing, however, the reasons of his ejection from the
Church by the bishop Alexander, and making a dishonest use of the language of Holy
Scripture. When, therefore, he had declared upon oath that he did not hold the errors for
which he had been expelled from the Church by Alexander, Constantine dismissed him,
saying, ‘If thy faith is orthodox, thou hast well sworn; but if thy faith is impious and yet thou
hast sworn, let God from heaven judge thee.’ When he quitted the emperor, the partizans
of Eusebius, with their usual violence, desired to conduct him into the church; but Alexander,
of blessed memory, bishop of Constantinople, refused his permission, alleging that the inventor
of the heresy ought not to be admitted into communion. Then at last the partizans
of Eusebius pronounced the threat: ‘As, against your will, we succeeded in prevailing on the
emperor to send for Arius, so now, even if you forbid it, shall Arius join in communion378
with us in this church to-morrow.’ It was on Saturday that they said this. The bishop Alexander,
deeply grieved at what he had heard, went into the church and poured forth his
lamentations, raising his hands in supplication to God, and throwing himself on his face
<note type="footnote">375 The letter was written to Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis, not Tmi el Emdid, in Egypt. St. Anthony left one
of his sheepskin to Serapion, the other to Athanasius. Cf. Jer. de Vir. illust. 99.</note>
<note type="footnote">376 Athanasius, chosen alike by the designation of the dying Alexander, by popular acclamation, and by the
election of the Bishop of the Province, was, in spite of his reluctance and retirement, consecrated, a.d. 326.</note>

on the pavement in the sanctuary379, prayed. Macarius went in with him, prayed with him,
and heard his prayers. He asked one of two things. ‘If Arius,’ said he, ‘is to be joined to the
Church to-morrow, let me Thy servant depart, and do not destroy the pious with the impious.
If Thou wilt spare Thy Church, and I know that Thou dost spare her, look upon the words
of the followers of Eusebius, and give not over Thy heritage to destruction and to shame.
Remove Arius, lest if he come into the Church, heresy seem to come in with him, and impiety
be hereafter deemed piety.’ Having thus prayed, the bishop left the church deeply anxious,
and then a horrible and extraordinary catastrophe ensued. The followers of Eusebius had
launched out into threats, while the bishop had recourse to prayer. Arius, emboldened by
the protection of his party, delivered many trifling and foolish speeches, when he was suddenly
compelled by a call of nature to retire, and immediately, as it is written, ‘falling headlong,
he burst asunder in the midst380,’ and gave up the ghost, being deprived at once both
of communion and of life. This, then, was the end of Arius381. The followers of Eusebius
were covered with shame, and buried him whose belief they shared. The blessed Alexander
completed the celebration, rejoicing with the Church in piety and orthodoxy, praying with
all the brethren and greatly glorifying God. This was not because he rejoiced at the death
of Arius—God forbid; for ‘it is appointed unto all men once to die382;’ but because the event
plainly transcended any human condemnation. For the Lord Himself passing judgment
upon the menaces of the followers of Eusebius, and the prayer of Alexander, condemned
the Arian heresy, and shewed that it was unworthy of being received into the communion
of the Church; thus manifesting to all that, even if it received the countenance and support
of the emperor, and of all men, yet by truth itself it stood condemned.”</p>
<p>These were the first fruits, reaped by Arius, of those pernicious seeds which he had
himself sown, and formed the prelude to the punishments that awaited him hereafter. His
impiety was condemned by his punishment.</p>
<p>I shall now turn my narrative to the piety of the emperor. He addressed a letter to all
the subjects of the Roman empire, exhorting them to renounce their former errors, and to
embrace the doctrines of our Saviour, and trying to guide them to this truth. He stirred up
the bishops in every city to build churches, and encouraged them not only by his letter, but

<head>Chapter XIV.—Letter written by the Emperor Constantine respecting the building of
Churches383.</head>
<p>“Constantinus Augustus, the great and the victorious, to Eusebius.</p>
<p>“I am well aware, and am thoroughly convinced, my beloved brother, that as the servants
of our Saviour Christ have been suffering up to the present time from nefarious machinations
and tyrannical persecutions, the fabrics of all the churches must have either fallen into utter
ruin from neglect, or, through apprehension of the impending iniquity, have been reduced
below their proper dignity. But now that freedom is restored, and that dragon384, through
the providence of God, and by our instrumentality, thrust out from the government of the
Empire, I think that the divine power has become known to all, and that those who hitherto,
from fear or from incredulity or from depravity, have lived in error, will now, upon becoming
acquainted with Him who truly is, be led into the true and correct manner of life. Exert
yourself, therefore, diligently in the reparation of the churches under your own jurisdiction,
and admonish the principal bishops, priests, and deacons of other places to engage zealously
in the same work; in order that all the churches which still exist may be repaired or enlarged,
and that new ones may be built wherever they are required. You, and others through your
intervention, can apply to magistrates385 and to provincial governments386, for all that may
be necessary for this purpose; for they have received written injunctions to render zealous
obedience to whatever your holiness may command. May God preserve you, beloved
brother.”</p>
<p>Thus the emperor wrote to the bishops in each province respecting the building of
churches. From his letter to Eusebius of Palestine, it is easily learnt what measures he adopted
to obtain copies of the Holy Bible387.</p>

<p>“In the city388 which bears our name, a great number of persons have, through the
providential care of God the Saviour, united themselves to the holy Church. As all things
there are in a state of rapid improvement, we deemed it most important that an additional
number of churches should be built. Adopt joyfully the mode of procedure determined
upon by us, which we have thought expedient to make known to your prudence, namely,
that you should get written, on fine parchment, fifty volumes389, easily legible and handy
for use; these you must have transcribed by skilled calligraphers, accurately acquainted with
their art. I mean, of course, copies of the Holy Scriptures, which, as you know, it is most
necessary that the congregation of the Church should both have and use. A letter has been
sent from our clemency to the catholicus390 of the diocese, in order that he may be careful
that everything necessary for the undertaking is supplied. The duty devolving upon you is
to take measures to ensure the completion of these manuscripts within a short space of time.
When they are finished, you are authorised by this letter to order two public carriages for
the purpose of transmitting them to us; and thus the fair manuscripts will be easily submitted
to our inspection. Appoint one of the deacons of your church to take charge of this part of
the business; when he comes to us, he shall receive proofs of our benevolence. May God
preserve you, beloved brother.”</p>
<p>What has been already said is enough to shew, nay to clearly prove, how great zeal the
emperor manifested on the matters of religion. I will, however, add his noble acts with regard
to the Sepulchre of our Saviour. For having learnt that the idolaters, in their frantic rage,
had heaped earth over the Lord’s tomb, eager thus to destroy all remembrance of His Salvation,
and had built over it a temple to the goddess of unbridled lust, in mockery of the Virgin’s
birth, the emperor ordered the foul shrine to be demolished, and the soil polluted with ab-
ominable sacrifices to be carried away and thrown out far from the city, and a new temple
of great size and beauty to be erected on the site. All this is clearly set forth in the letter
which he wrote to the president391 of the church of Jerusalem, Macarius, whom we have

<head>Chapter XVI.—Letter from the Emperor to Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, concerning the
building of the Holy Church.</head>
<p>“Constantinus, the victorious and the great, to Macarius.</p>
<p>“The grace of our Saviour is so wonderful, that no words are adequate to express the
present marvel. The fact that the monument of His most holy sufferings should have remained
concealed beneath the earth, during so long a course of years, until the time when,
on the death of the common enemy of all, it was destined to shine forth on His liberated
servants, surpasses every other subject of admiration. If all the wise men throughout the
world were collected into one place, and were to endeavour to express themselves worthily
of it, they could not approach within an infinite distance of it; for this miracle is as much
beyond all human power of belief, as heavenly things by their nature are mightier than human.
Hence it is my first and only object that, as by new miracles the faith in the truth is
daily confirmed, so the minds of us all may be more earnestly devoted to the holy law, wisely,
zealously, and with one accord. As my design is, I think, now generally known, I desire that
you, above all, should be assured that my most intense anxiety is to decorate with beautiful
edifices that consecrated spot, which by God’s command I have relieved from the burden
of the foul idol which encumbered it. For from the beginning He declared it holy, and has
rendered it still more holy from the time that He brought to light the proof and memorial
of the sufferings of our Lord.</p>
<p>I trust, then, to your sagacity to take every necessary care, not only that the basilica itself
surpass all others; but that all its arrangements be such that this building may be incomparably
superior to the most beautiful structures in every city throughout the world. We have
entrusted our friend Dracilianus392, who discharges the functions of the most illustrious
præfect of the province, with the superintendence of the work of the erection and decoration
of the walls. He has received our orders to engage workmen and artisans, and to provide all
that you may deem requisite for the building. Let us know, by letter, when you have inspected
the work, what columns or marbles you consider would be most ornamental, in order that
whatever you may inform us is necessary for the work may be conveyed thither from all
quarters of the world. For that which is of all places the most wonderful, ought to be decorated
in accordance with its dignity. I wish to learn from you whether you think that the vaulted
roof of the basilica ought to be panelled393, or to be adorned in some other way; for if it is
to be panelled it may also be gilt. Your holiness must signify to the aforesaid officers, as
soon as possible, what workmen and artificers, and what sums of money, are requisite; and
let me know promptly not only about the marbles and columns, but also about the panelled

<head>Chapter XVII.—Helena395, Mother of the Emperor Constantine.—Her zeal in the Erection
of the Holy Church.</head>
<p>The bearer of these letters was no less illustrious a personage than the mother of the
emperor, even she who was glorious in her offspring, whose piety was celebrated by all; she
who brought forth that great luminary and nurtured him in piety. She did not shrink from
the fatigue of the journey on account of her extreme old age, but undertook it a little before
her death, which occurred in her eightieth year396.</p>
<p>When the empress beheld the place where the Saviour suffered, she immediately ordered
the idolatrous temple, which had been there erected397, to be destroyed, and the very earth
on which it stood to be removed. When the tomb, which had been so long concealed, was
discovered, three crosses were seen buried near the Lord’s sepulchre. All held it as certain
that one of these crosses was that of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the other two were those
of the thieves who were crucified with Him. Yet they could not discern to which of the three
the Body of the Lord had been brought nigh, and which had received the outpouring of His
precious Blood. But the wise and holy Macarius, the president of the city, resolved this
question in the following manner. He caused a lady of rank, who had been long suffering
from disease, to be touched by each of the crosses, with earnest prayer, and thus discerned
the virtue residing in that of the Saviour. For the instant this cross was brought near the
lady, it expelled the sore disease, and made her whole.</p>
<p>The mother of the emperor, on learning the accomplishment of her desire, gave orders
that a portion of the nails should be inserted in the royal helmet, in order that the head of
her son might be preserved from the darts of his enemies398. The other portion of the nails
she ordered to be formed into the bridle of his horse, not only to ensure the safety of the

“Stabulariam hanc primo fuisse adserunt, sic cognitam Constantio seniori.” (Ambr. de obitu Theod. §42, p.
295.) The story of her being the daughter of a British Prince, and born at York or Colchester, is part of the belief
current since William of Malmesbury concerning Constantine’s British Origin, which is probably due to two
passages of uncertain interpretation in the Panegyrici: (a) Max. et Const. iv., “liberavit ille (Constantius) Britannias
servitute, tu etiam nobiles, illic oriendo, fecisti.” (b) Eum. Pan. Const. ix., “O fortunata et nunc omnibus

emperor, but also to fulfil an ancient prophecy; for long before Zechariah, the prophet, had
predicted that “There shall be upon the bridles of the horses Holiness unto the Lord

<p>She had part of the cross of our Saviour conveyed to the palace400. The rest was enclosed
in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted
to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity401. She
then sent everywhere for workmen and for materials, and caused the most spacious and
most magnificent churches to be erected. It is unnecessary to describe their beauty and
grandeur; for all the pious, if I may so speak, hasten thither and behold the magnificence of
the buildings402.</p>
<p>This celebrated and admirable empress performed another action worthy of being remembered.
She assembled all the women who had vowed perpetual virginity, and placing
them on couches, she herself fulfilled the duties of a handmaid, serving them with food and
handing them cups and pouring out wine, and bringing a basin and pitcher, and pouring
out water to wash their hands.</p>
<p>After performing these and other laudable actions, the empress returned to her son,
and not long after, she joyfully entered upon the other and a better life, after having given
her son much pious advice and her fervent parting blessing. After her death, those honours
were rendered to her memory which her stedfast and zealous service to God deserved403.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Unlawful Translation of Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia.</head>
<p>The Arian party did not desist from their evil machinations. They had only signed the
confession of faith for the purpose of disguising themselves in sheeps’-skins, while they were
acting the part of wolves. The holy Alexander, of Byzantium, for the city was not yet called
Constantinople, who by his prayer had pierced Arius to the heart, had, at the period to
which we are referring, been translated to a better life. Eusebius, the propagator of impiety,
little regarding the definition which, only a short time previously, he with the other bishops
had agreed upon, without delay quitted Nicomedia and seized upon the see of Constantinople,
in direct violation of that canon404 which prohibits bishops and presbyters from being
translated from one city to another. But that those who carry their infatuation so far as to
deny the divinity of the only-begotten Son of God, should likewise violate the other laws,
cannot excite surprise. Nor was this the first occasion that he made this innovation; for,
having been originally entrusted with the see of Berytus, he leapt from thence to Nicomedia.
Whence he was expelled by the synod, on account of his manifest impiety, as was likewise
Theognis, bishop of Nicæa. This is related a second time in the letters of the emperor Constantine;
and I shall here insert the close of the letter which he wrote to the Nicomedians.</p>
<note type="footnote">404 i.e. Apost. Can. xiv., which forbids translation without an “εὔλογος αἰτία, or prospect of more spiritual

<p>“Who has taught these doctrines to the innocent multitude? It is manifestly Eusebius,
the co-operator in the cruelty of the tyrants. For that he was the creature405 of the tyrant
has been clearly shown; and, indeed, is proved by the slaughter of the bishops, and by the
fact that these victims were true bishops. The relentless persecution of the Christians proclaims
this fact aloud.</p>
<p>“I shall not here say anything of the insults directed against me, by which the conspiracies
of the opposite faction were mainly carried out. But he went so far as to send spies to watch
me, and scarcely refrained from raising troops in aid of the tyrant. Let not any one imagine
that I allege what I am not prepared to prove. I am in possession of clear evidence; for I have
caused the bishops and presbyters belonging to his following to be seized. But I pass over

charged as accomplices; for you are influenced by the doctrines of Eusebius, and have thus
been led away from the truth. But your cure will be speedy, if, after obtaining a bishop who
holds pure and faithful doctrines, you will but look unto God. This depends upon you alone;
and you would, no doubt, have thus acted long ago, had not the aforesaid Eusebius come
here, strongly supported by those then in power, and overturned all discipline.</p>
<p>“As it is necessary to say something more about Eusebius, your patience will remember
that a council was held in the city of Nicæa, at which, in obedience to my conscience, I was
present, being actuated by no other motive than the desire of producing unanimity among
all, and before all else of proving and dispelling the mischief which originated from the infatuation
of Arius of Alexandria, and was straightway strengthened by the absurd and pernicious
machinations of Eusebius. But, beloved and much-honoured brethren, you know
not how earnestly and how disgracefully Eusebius, although convicted by the testimony of
his own conscience, persevered in the support of the false doctrines which had been universally
condemned. He secretly sent persons to me to petition on his behalf, and personally
intreated my assistance in preventing his being ejected from his bishopric, although his
crimes had been fully detected. God, who, I trust, will continue His goodness towards you
and towards me, is witness to the truth of what I say. I was then myself deluded and deceived
by Eusebius, as you shall well know. In everything he acted according to his own desire, his
mind being full of every kind of secret evil.</p>
<p>“Omitting the relation of the rest of his misdeeds, it is well that you should be informed
of the crime which he lately perpetrated in concert with Theognis, the accomplice of his
<note type="footnote">405 πρόσφυξ, originally a protected “runaway,” then protégé or client.</note>

folly. I had sent orders for the apprehension of certain individuals in Alexandria who had
deserted our faith, and by whose means the firebrand of dissension was kindled. But these
good gentlemen, forsooth, bishops, whom, by the clemency of the council, I had reserved
for penitence, not only received them under their protection, but also participated in their
evil deeds. Hence I came to the determination to punish these ungrateful men, by apprehending
and banishing them to some far-distant region.</p>
<p>“It is now your duty to look unto God with that same faith which it is clear that you
have ever held, and in which it is fitting you should abide. So let us have cause of rejoicing
in the appointment of pure, orthodox, and beneficent bishops. If any one should make
mention of those destroyers, or presume to speak in their praise, let him know that his audacity
will be repressed by the authority which has been committed to me as the servant of
God. May God preserve you, beloved brethren!”</p>
<p>The above-mentioned bishops were then deposed and banished. Amphion406 was entrusted
with the church of Nicomedia, and Chrestus407 with that of Nicæa. But the exiled
bishops, employing their customary artifices, abused the benevolence of the emperor, renewed
the previous contests, and regained their former power.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—The artful Machinations of Eusebius and his followers against the Holy Eustathius,
Bishop of Antioch.</head>
<p>Eusebius, as I have already stated, seized the diocese of Constantinople by force. And
thus having acquired great power in that city, frequently visiting and holding familiar intercourse
with the emperor, he gained confidence and formed plots against those who were
foremost in the support of the truth. He at first feigned a desire of going to Jerusalem, to
see the celebrated edifices there erected: and the emperor, who was deceived by his flattery,
allowed him to set out with the utmost honour, providing him with carriages, and the rest
of his equipage and retinue. Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, who, as we have before said, was
his accomplice in his evil designs, travelled with him. When they arrived at Antioch, they
put on the mask of friendship, and were received with the utmost deference. Eustathius, the
great champion of the faith, treated them with fraternal kindness. When they arrived at the
holy places, they had an interview with those who were of the same opinions as themselves,
namely, Eusebius, bishop of Cæsarea, Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis, Aetius, bishop of
Lydda, Theodotus, bishop of Laodicea, and others who had imbibed the Arian sentiments;
they made known the plot they had hatched to them, and went with them to Antioch. The
pretext for their journey was, that due honour might be rendered to Eusebius; but their real
motive was their war against religion. They bribed a low woman, who made a traffic of her
beauty, to sell them her tongue, and then repaired to the council, and when all the spectators
had been ordered to retire, they introduced the wretched woman. She held a babe in her
arms, of which she loudly and impudently affirmed that Eustathius was the father. Eustathius,
conscious of his innocence, asked her whether she could bring forward any witness to
prove what she had advanced. She replied that she could not: yet these equitable judges admitted
her to oath, although it is said in the law, that “at the mouth of two or three witnesses
shall the matter be established408;” and the apostle says, “against an elder receive not any
accusation but before two or three witnesses409.” But they despised these divine laws, and
admitted the accusation against this great man without any witnesses. When the woman
had again declared upon oath that Eustathius was the father of the babe, these truth-loving
judges condemned him as an adulterer. When the other bishops, who upheld the apostolical
doctrines, being ignorant of all these intrigues, openly opposed the sentence, and advised
Eustathius not to submit to it, the originators of the plot promptly repaired to the emperor,
and endeavoured to persuade him that the accusation was true, and the sentence of deposition
<note type="footnote">408 Deut. xix. 15</note>

just; and they succeeded in obtaining the banishment of this champion of piety and chastity,
as an adulterer and a tyrant. He was conducted across Thrace to a city of Illyricum410.</p>
<note type="footnote">410 Jerome says Trajanopolis, but Eustathius died at Philippi, circa 337. Athanasius, who calls Eustathius “a
confessor and sound in the faith” (Hist. Ar. §4), says the false charge which had most weight with Constantine
was that the bishop of Antioch had slandered the Empress Helena. Sozomen (II. 19) records the patience with
which Eustathius suffered, and sums up his character as that of “a good and true man, specially remarkable for
eloquence, to which his extant writings testify, admirable as they are alike for the dignity of their style of ancient
cast, the sound wisdom of their sentiments, the beauty of their language, and grace of expression.” The sole
survivor of his works is an attack on Origen’s interpretation of Scripture.</note>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Bishops of Heretical opinions ordained in Antioch after the Banishment of
St. Eustathius411.</head>
<p>Eulalius was first consecrated in place of Eustathius. But Eulalius surviving his elevation
only a short period, it was intended that Eusebius of Palestine should be translated to this
bishopric. Eusebius, however, refused the appointment, and the emperor forbade its being
conferred on him. Next Euphronius was put forward, who also dying, after a lapse of only
one year and a few months, the see was conferred on Flaccillus412. All these bishops secretly
clung to the Arian heresy. Hence it was that most of those individuals, whether of the clergy
or of the laity, who valued the true religion, left the churches and formed assemblies among
themselves. They were called Eustathians, since it was after the banishment of Eustathius
that they began to hold their meetings. The wretched woman above-mentioned was soon
after attacked by a severe and protracted illness, and then avowed the imposture in which
she had been engaged, and made known the whole plot, not only to two or three, but to a
very large number of priests. She confessed that she had been bribed to bring this false and
impudent charge, but yet that her oath was not altogether false, as a certain Eustathius, a
coppersmith, was the father of the babe. Such were some of the crimes perpetrated in Antioch
by this most excellent faction.</p>
<note type="footnote">411 Socrates, H E. i. 24, says that on the deposition of Eustathius “ἐφεξῆς ἐπὶ ἔτη ὀκτὼ λέγεται τὸν ἐν

is much confusion about this succession of bishops. Jerome (Chron. ii. p. 92) gives the names of the Arian
bishops thrust in succession into the place of Eustathius, as Eulalius, Eusebius, Eufronius, Placillus. “Perhaps
Eulalius was put forward for the vacant see, like Eusebius, but never actually appointed.” Bp. Lightfoot, Dict.
Christ. Biog. ii. 315.</note>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Conversion of the Indians413.</head>
<p>At this period, the light of the knowledge of God was for the first time shed upon India.
The courage and the piety of the emperor had become celebrated throughout the world;
and the barbarians, having learnt by experience to choose peace rather than war, were able
to enjoy intercourse with one another without fear. Many persons, therefore, set out on long
journeys; some for the desire of making discoveries, others from a spirit of commercial enterprise.
About this period a native of Tyre414, acquainted with Greek philosophy, desiring
to penetrate into the interior of India, set off for this purpose with his two young nephews.
When he had accomplished the object of his wishes, he embarked for his own country. The
ship being compelled to put in to land in order to obtain a fresh supply of water, the barbarians
fell upon her, drowned some of the crew, and took the others prisoners. The uncle was
among the number of those who were killed, and the lads were conducted to the king. The
name of the one was Ædesius, and of the other Frumentius. The king of the country, in
course of time, perceiving their intelligence, promoted them to the superintendence of his
household. If any one should doubt the truth of this account, let him recall to mind the
history of Joseph in the kingdom of Egypt, and also the history of Daniel, and of the three
champions of the truth, who, from being captives, became princes of Babylon. The king
died; but these young men remained with his son, and were advanced to still greater power.
As they had been brought up in the true religion, they exhorted the merchants who visited
the country to assemble, according to the custom of Romans415, to take part in the divine
liturgy. After a considerable time they solicited the king to reward their services by permitting
them to return to their own country. They obtained his permission, and safely reached Roman
territory. Ædesius directed his course towards Tyre, but Frumentius, whose religious zeal
was greater than the natural feeling of affection for his relatives, proceeded to Alexandria,
and informed the bishop of that city that the Indians were deeply anxious to obtain spiritual
light. Athanasius then held the rudder of that church; he heard the story, and then “Who,”
said he, “better than you yourself can scatter the mists of ignorance, and introduce among
this people the light of Divine preaching?” After having said this, he conferred upon him

Church of Rome, in the later sense of the word, as has sometimes been represented. Cf. Soc. I. 19, τὰς χριστιανικὰς

the episcopal dignity, and sent him to the spiritual culture of that nation. The newly-ordained
bishop left this country, caring nothing for the mighty ocean, and returned to the untilled
ground of his work. There, having the grace of God to labour with him, he cheerfully and
successfully played the husbandman, catching those who sought to gainsay his words by
works of apostolic wonder, and thus, by these marvels, confirming his teaching, he continued
each day to take many souls alive416.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Conversion of the Iberians417.</head>
<p>Frumentius thus led the Indians to the knowledge of God. Iberia, about the same time,
was guided into the way of truth by a captive woman418. She continued instant in prayer,
allowing herself no softer bed than a sack spread upon the ground, and accounted fasting
her highest luxury. This austerity was rewarded by gifts similar to those of the Apostles. The
barbarians, who were ignorant of medicine, were accustomed, when attacked by disease, to
go to one another’s houses, in order to ask those who had suffered in a similar way, and had
got well, by what means they had been cured. In accordance with this custom, a mother
who had a sick child, repaired to this admirable woman, to enquire if she knew of any cure
for the disease. The latter took the child, placed it upon her bed, and prayed to the Creator
of the world to be propitious to it, and cure the disease. He heard her prayer, and made it
whole. This extraordinary woman hence obtained great celebrity; and the queen, who was
suffering from a severe disease, hearing of her by report, sent for her. The captive held herself
in very low estimation, and would not accept the invitation of the queen. But the queen,
forced by her sore need, and careless of her royal dignity, herself ran to the captive. The
latter made the queen lie down upon her mean bed, and once again applied to her disease
the efficacious remedy of prayer. The queen was healed, and offered as rewards for her cure,
gold, silver, tunics, and mantles, and such gifts as she thought worthy of possession, and
such as royal munificence should bestow. The holy woman told her that she did not want
any of these, but that she would deem her greatest reward to be the queen’s knowledge of
true religion. She then, as far as in her lay, explained the Divine doctrines, and exhorted her
to erect a church in honour of Christ who had made her whole. The queen then returned
to the palace, and excited the admiration of her consort, by the suddenness of her cure; she
then made known to him the power of that God whom the captive adored, and besought
him to acknowledge the one only God, and to erect a church to Him, and to lead all the
nation to worship Him. The king was greatly delighted with the miracle which had been
performed upon the queen, but he would not consent to erect a church. A short time after
he went out hunting, and the loving Lord made a prey of him as He did of Paul; for a sudden
darkness enveloped him and forbade him to move from the spot; while those who were

with our nun (Neale, i. 61). Moses of Chorene (ii. 83) gives the name “Nunia.” Rufinus (i. 10) states that he gives

hunting with him enjoyed the customary sunlight, and he alone was bound with the fetters
of blindness. In his perplexity he found a way of escape, for calling to mind his former unbelief,
he implored the help of the God of the captive woman, and immediately the darkness
was dispelled. He then went to the marvellous captive, and asked her to shew him how a
church ought to be built. He who once filled Bezaleel with architectural skill, graciously
enabled this woman to devise the plan of a church. The woman set about the plan, and men
began to dig and build. When the edifice was completed, the roof put on, and every thing
supplied except the priests, this admirable woman found means to obtain these also. For
she persuaded the king to send an embassy to the Roman emperor asking for teachers of
religion. The king accordingly despatched an embassy for the purpose. The emperor Constantine,
who was warmly attached to the cause of religion, when informed of the purport
of the embassy, gladly welcomed the ambassadors, and selected a bishop endowed with
great faith, wisdom, and virtue, and presenting him with many gifts, sent him to the Iberians,
that he might make known to them the true God. Not content with having granted the requests
of the Iberians, he of his own accord undertook the protection of the Christians in
Persia; for, learning that they were persecuted by the heathens, and that their king himself,
a slave to error, was contriving various cunning plots for their destruction, he wrote to him,
entreating him to embrace the Christian religion himself, as well as to honour its professors.
His own letter will render his earnestness in the cause the plainer.</p>

<p>This excellent emperor felt so much solicitude for all who had embraced the true religion,
that he not only watched over those who were his own subjects, but also over the subjects
of other sovereigns. For this reason he was blessed with the special protection of God, so
that although he held the reins of the whole of Europe and of Africa, and the greater part
of Asia, his subjects were all well disposed to his rule, and obedient to his government.
Foreign nations submitted to his sway, some by voluntary submission, others overcome in
war. Trophies were everywhere erected, and the emperor was styled Victorious.</p>
<p>The praises of Constantine have, however, been proclaimed by many other writers. We
must resume the thread of our history. This emperor, who deserves the highest fame, devoted
his whole mind to matters worthy of the apostles, while men who had been admitted to the
sacerdotal dignity not only neglected to edify the church, but endeavoured to uproot it from
the very foundations. They invented all manner of false accusations against those who governed
the church in accordance with the doctrines taught by the apostles, and did their best
to depose and banish them. Their envy was not satisfied by the infamous falsehood which
they had invented against Eustathius, but they had recourse to every artifice to effect the
overthrow of another great bulwark of religion. These tragic occurrences I shall now relate

<head>Chapter XXV.—An account of the plot formed against the Holy Athanasius.</head>
<p>Alexander, that admirable bishop, who had successfully withstood the blasphemies of
Arius, died five months after the council of Nicæa, and was succeeded in the episcopate of
the church of Alexandria by Athanasius. Trained from his youth in sacred studies, Athanasius
had attracted general admiration in each ecclesiastical office that he filled. He had, at
the general council, so defended the doctrines of the apostles, that while he won the approbation
of all the champions of the truth, its opponents learned to look on their antagonist as
a personal foe and public enemy. He had attended the council as one of the retinue of Alexander,
then a very young man, although he was the principal deacon429.</p>
<p>When those who had denied the only-begotten Son of God heard that the helm of the
Church of Alexandria had been entrusted to his hands knowing as they did by experience
his zeal for the truth, they thought that his rule would prove the destruction of their authority.
They, therefore, resorted to the following machinations against him. In order to avert suspicion,
they bribed some of the adherents of Meletius, who, although deposed by the council
of Nicæa, had persevered in exciting commotions in the Thebaid and in the adjacent part
of Egypt, and persuaded them to go to the emperor, and to accuse Athanasius of levying a
tax upon Egypt430, and giving the gold collected to a certain man who was preparing to
usurp the imperial power431. The emperor being deceived by this story, Athanasius was
brought to Constantinople. Upon his arrival he proved that the accusation was false, and
had the charge given him by God restored to him. This is shown by a letter from the emperor
to the Church of Alexandria of which I shall transcribe only the concluding paragraph.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Another plot against Athanasius.</head>
<p>The calumniators of Athanasius, however, did not desist from their attempts. On the
contrary, they devised so bold a fiction against him, that it surpassed every invention of the
ancient writers of the tragic or comic stage. They again bribed individuals of the same party,
and brought them before the emperor, vociferously accusing that champion of virtue of
many abominable crimes. The leaders of the party were Eusebius, Theognis, and Theodorus,
bishop of Perinthus, a city now called Heraclea433. After having accused Athanasius of
crimes which they described as too shocking to be tolerated, or even listened to, they persuaded
the emperor to convene a council at Cæsarea in Palestine, where Athanasius had
many enemies, and to command that his cause should be there tried. The emperor, utterly
ignorant of the plot that had been devised, was persuaded by them to give the required order.</p>
<p>But the holy Athanasius, well aware of the malevolence of those who were to try him,
refused to appear at the council. This served as a pretext to those who opposed the truth to
criminate him still further; and they accused him before the emperor of contumacy and arrogance.
Nor were their hopes altogether frustrated; for the emperor, although exceedingly
forbearing, became exasperated by their representations, and wrote to him in an angry
manner, commanding him to repair to Tyre. Here the council was ordered to assemble,
from the suspicion, as I think, that Athanasius had an apprehension of Cæsarea on account
of its bishop. The emperor wrote also to the council in a style consistent with his devoted
piety. His letter is as follows.</p>

<p>“Constantinus Augustus to the holy council assembled in Tyre.</p>
<p>“In the general prosperity which distinguishes the present time, it seems right that the
Catholic Church should likewise be exempt from trouble, and that the servants of Christ
should be freed from every reproach.</p>
<p>“But certain individuals instigated by the mad desire of contention, not to say leading
a life unworthy of their profession, are endeavoring to throw all into disorder. This appears
to me to be the greatest of all possible calamities. I beseech you, therefore, in post haste, as
the phrase goes, to assemble together, without any delay, in formal synod; so that you may
support those who require your assistance, heal the brethren who are in danger, restore
unanimity to the divided members, and rectify the disorders of the Church while time permits;
and thus restore to those great provinces the harmony which, alas! the arrogance of a
few men has destroyed. I believe every one would admit that you could not perform anything
so pleasing in the sight of God, so surpassing all my prayers as well as your own, or so conducive
to your own reputation, as to restore peace.</p>
<p>“Do not ye therefore delay, but when you have come together with all that sincerity and
fidelity which our Saviour demands of all His servants, almost in words that we can hear,
endeavour with redoubled eagerness to put a fitting end to these dissensions.</p>
<p>“Nothing shall be omitted on my part to further the interests of our religion. I have
done all that you recommended in your letters. I have sent to those bishops whom you
specified, directing them to repair to the council for the purpose of deliberating with you
upon ecclesiastical matters. I have also sent Dionysius435, a man of consular rank, to counsel
those who are to sit in synod with you, and to be himself an eye witness of your proceedings,
and particularly of the order and regularity that is maintained. If any one should dare on
the present occasion also to disobey our command, and refuse to come to the council, which,
however, I do not anticipate, an officer will be despatched immediately to send him into
banishment by imperial order, that he may learn not to oppose the decrees enacted by the
emperor for the support of truth.</p>
<p>“All that now devolves upon your holinesses is to decide with unanimous judgment,
without partiality or prejudice, in accordance with the ecclesiastical and apostolical rule,
and to devise suitable remedies for the offences which may have resulted from error; in order
that the Church may be freed from all reproach, that my anxiety may be diminished, that

<p>The bishops accordingly repaired to the council of Tyre. Amongst them were those who
were accused of holding heterodox doctrines; of whom Asclepas, bishop of Gaza, was one.
The admirable Athanasius also attended. I shall first dwell on the tragedy of the accusation,
and shall then relate the proceedings of this celebrated tribunal.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—The Council of Tyre.</head>
<p>Arsenius was a bishop of the Meletian faction. The men of his party put him in a place
of concealment, and charged him to remain there as long as possible. They then cut off the
right hand of a corpse, embalmed it, placed it in a wooden case, and carried it about everywhere,
declaring that it was the hand of Arsenius, who had been murdered by Athanasius.
But the all-seeing eye did not permit Arsenius to remain long in concealment. He was first
seen alive in Egypt; then in the Thebaid; afterwards he was led by Divine Providence to Tyre,
where the hand of tragic fame was brought before the council. The friends of Athanasius
hunted him up, and brought him to an inn, where they compelled him to lie hid for a time.
Early in the morning the great Athanasius came to the council.</p>
<p>First of all a woman of lewd life was brought in, who deposed in a loud and impudent
manner that she had vowed perpetual virginity, but that Athanasius, who had lodged in her
house, had violated her chastity. After she had made her charge, the accused came forward,
and with him a presbyter worthy of all praise, by name Timotheus. The court ordered Athanasius
to reply to the indictment; but he was silent, as if he had not been Athanasius.
Timotheus, however, addressed her thus: “Have I, O woman, ever conversed with you, or
have I entered your house?” She replied with still greater effrontery, screaming aloud in her
dispute with Timotheus, and, pointing at him with her finger, exclaimed, “It was you who
robbed me of my virginity; it was you who stripped me of my chastity;” adding other indelicate
expressions which are used by shameless women. The devisers of this calumny were
put to shame, and all the bishops who were privy to it, blushed.</p>
<p>The woman was now being led out of the Court, but the great Athanasius protested that
instead of sending her away they ought to examine her, and learn the name of the hatcher
of the plot. Hereupon his accusers yelled and shouted that he had perpetrated other viler
crimes, of which it was utterly impossible that he could by any art or ingenuity be cleared;
and that eyes, not ears, would decide on the evidence. Having said this, they exhibited the
famous box and exposed the embalmed hand to view. At this sight all the spectators uttered
a loud cry. Some believed the accusation to be true; the others had no doubt of the falsehood,
and thought that Arsenius was lurking somewhere or other in concealment. When at length,
after some difficulty, a little silence was obtained, the accused asked his judges whether any
of them knew Arsenius. Several of them replying that they knew him well, Athanasius gave
orders that he should be brought before them. Then he again asked them, “Is this the right
Arsenius? Is this the man I murdered? Is this the man those people mutilated after his
murder by cutting off his right hand?” When they had confessed that it was the same individual,
Athanasius pulled off his cloak, and exhibited two hands, both the right and the left,
and said, “Let no one seek for a third hand, for man has received two hands from the Creator
and no more.”</p>

<pb n="139"/>
<p>Even after this plain proof the calumniators and the judges who were privy to the crime,
instead of hiding themselves, or praying that the earth might open and swallow them up,
raised an uproar and commotion in the assembly, and declared that Athanasius was a sorcerer,
and that he had by his magical incantations bewitched the eyes of men. The very men
who a moment before had accused him of murder now strove to tear him in pieces and to
murder him. But those whom the emperor had entrusted with the preservation of order
saved the life of Athanasius by dragging him away, and hurrying him on board a ship436.</p>
<p>When he appeared before the emperor, he described all the dramatic plot which had
been got up to ruin him. The calumniators sent bishops attached to their faction into
Mareotis, viz., Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, Theodorus, bishop of Perinthus, Maris, bishop
of Chalcedon, Narcissus of Cilicia437, with others of the same sentiments. Mareotis is a
district near Alexandria, and derives its name from the lake Maria438. Here they invented
other falsehoods, and, forging the reports of the trial, mixed up the charges which had been
shown to be false with fresh accusations, as if they had been true, and despatched them to
the emperor.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Consecration of the Church of Jerusalem.—Banishment of St. Athanasius.</head>
<p>All the bishops who were present at the council of Tyre, with all others from every
quarter, were commanded by the emperor to proceed to Ælia439 to consecrate the churches
which he had there erected. The emperor despatched also a number of officials of the most
kindly disposition, remarkable for piety and fidelity, whom he ordered to furnish abundant
supplies of provisions, not only to the bishops and their followers, but to the vast multitudes
who flocked from all parts to Jerusalem. The holy altar was decorated with imperial hangings
and with golden vessels set with gems. When the splendid festival was concluded, each
bishop returned to his own diocese. The emperor was highly gratified when informed of
the splendour and magnificence of the function, and blessed the Author of all good for
having thus granted his petition.</p>
<p>Athanasius having complained of his unjust condemnation, the emperor commanded
the bishops against whom this complaint was directed to present themselves at court. Upon
their arrival, they desisted from urging any of their former calumnies, because they knew
how clearly they could be refuted; but they made it appear that Athanasius had threatened
to prevent the exportation of corn. The emperor believed what they said, and banished him
to a city of Gaul called Treves440. This occurred in the thirtieth year of the emperor’s reign441.</p>

<p>It ought not to excite astonishment that Constantine was so far deceived as to send so
many great men into exile: for he believed the assertions of bishops of high fame and reputation,
who skilfully concealed their malice. Those who are acquainted with the Sacred
Scriptures know that the holy David, although he was a prophet, was deceived; and that too
not by a priest, but by one who was a menial, a slave, and a rascal. I mean Ziba, who deluded
the king by lies against Mephibosheth, and thus obtained his land445. It is not to condemn
the prophet that I thus speak; but that I may defend the emperor, by showing the weakness
of human nature, and to teach that credit should not be given only to those who advance
accusations, even though they may appear worthy of credit; but that the other party ought
also to be heard, and that one ear should be left open to the accused.</p>

<p>The body of the emperor was enclosed in a golden coffin, and was carried to Constantinople
by the governors of the provinces, the military commanders, and the other officers
of state, preceded and followed by the whole army, all bitterly deploring their loss; for
Constantine had been as an affectionate father to them all. The body of the emperor was
allowed to remain in the palace until the arrival of his sons, and high honours were rendered
to it. But these details require no description here, as a full account has been given by other
writers. From their works, which are easy of access, may be learnt how greatly the Ruler of
all honours His faithful servants. If any one should be tempted to unbelief, let him look at
what occurs now near the tomb and the statue of Constantine447, and then he must admit
the truth of what God has said in the Scriptures, “Them that honour Me I will honour, and
they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed448.”</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Return of St. Athanasius.</head>
<p>The divine Athanasius returned to Alexandria, after having remained two years and
four months at Treves449. Constantine, the eldest son of Constantine the Great, whose imperial
sway extended over Western Gaul, wrote the following letter to the church of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Epistle of the Emperor Constantine, the son of Constantine the Great, to the Alexandrians.
“Constantinus Cæsar to the people of the Catholic Church of Alexandria.</p>
<p>“I think that it cannot have escaped your pious intelligence that Athanasius, the interpreter
of the venerated law, was opportunely sent into Gaul, in order that, so long as the
savagery of these bloodthirsty opponents was threatening peril to his sacred head, he might
be saved from suffering irremediable wrongs. To avoid this imminent peril, he was snatched
from the jaws of his foes, to remain in a city under my jurisdiction, where he might be
abundantly supplied with every necessary. Yet the greatness of his virtue, relying on the
grace of God, led him to despise all the calamities of adverse fortune. Constantine, my lord
and my father, of blessed memory, intended to have reinstated him in his former bishopric,
and to have restored him to your piety; but as the emperor was arrested by the hand of death
before his desires were accomplished, I, being his heir, have deemed it fitting to carry into
execution the purpose of this sovereign of divine memory. You will learn from your bishop
himself, when you see him, with how much respect I have treated him. Nor indeed is it
surprising that he should have been thus treated by me. I was moved to this line of conduct
by his own great virtue, and the thought of your affectionate longing for his return. May
Divine Providence watch over you, beloved brethren!”</p>
<p>Furnished with this letter, St. Athanasius returned450 from exile, and was most gladly
welcomed both by the rich and by the poor, by the inhabitants of cities, and by those of the
provinces. The followers of the madness of Arius were the only persons who felt any vexation
at his return. Eusebius, Theognis, and those of their faction resorted to their former machinations,
and endeavoured to prejudice the ears of the young emperor against him.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Declension of the Emperor Constantius from the true Faith.</head>
<p>Constantia, the widow of Licinius, was the half-sister of Constantine451. She was intimately
acquainted with a certain priest who had imbibed the doctrines of Arius. He did not
openly acknowledge his unsoundness; but, in the frequent conversations which he had with
her, he did not refrain from declaring that Arius had been unjustly calumniated. After the
death of her impious husband, the renowned Constantine did everything in his power to
solace her, and strove to prevent her from experiencing the saddest trials of widowhood.
He attended her also in her last illness452, and rendered her every proper attention. She then
presented the priest whom I mentioned to the emperor, and entreated him to receive him
under his protection. Constantine acceded to her request, and soon after fulfilled his
promise. But though the priest was permitted the utmost freedom of speech, and was most
honourably treated, he did not venture to reveal his corrupt principles, for he observed the
firmness with which the emperor adhered to the truth. When Constantine was on the point
of being translated to an eternal kingdom, he drew up a will, in which he directed that his
temporal dominions should be divided among his sons. None of them was with him when
he was dying, so he entrusted the will to this priest alone, and desired him to give it to
Constantius, who, being at a shorter distance from the spot than his brothers, was expected
to arrive the first. These directions the priest executed, and thus by putting the will into his
hands, became known to Constantius, who accepted him as an intimate friend, and commanded
him to visit him frequently. Perceiving the weakness of Constantius, whose mind
was like reeds driven to and fro by the wind, he became emboldened to declare war against
the doctrines of the gospel. He loudly deplored the stormy state of the churches, and asserted
it to be due to those who had introduced the unscriptural word “consubstantial” into the
confession of faith, and that all the disputes among the clergy and the laity had been occasioned
by it. He calumniated Athanasius and all who coincided in his opinions, and formed
designs for their destruction, being used as their fellow-worker by Eusebius453, Theognis,
and Theodorus, bishop of Perinthus.</p>
<p>The last-named, whose see is generally known by the name of Heraclea, was a man of
great erudition, and had written an exposition of the Holy Scriptures454.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Second Exile of St. Athanasius.—Ordination and Death of Gregorius.</head>
<p>With these and similar arguments, the bishops assailed the weak-minded emperor, and
persuaded him to expel Athanasius from his church. But Athanasius obtained timely intimation
of their design, and departed to the west.456 The friends of Eusebius had sent false
accusations against him to Julius, who was then bishop of Rome457. In obedience to the
laws of the church, Julius summoned the accusers and the accused to Rome, that the cause
might be tried458. Athanasius, accordingly, set out for Rome, but the calumniators refused
to go because they saw that their falsehood would easily be detected459. But perceiving that
the flock of Athanasius was left without a pastor, they appointed over it a wolf instead of a
shepherd. Gregorius, for this was his name, surpassed the wild beasts in his deeds of cruelty
towards the flock: but at the expiration of six years he was destroyed by the sheep themselves.
Athanasius went to Constans (Constantine, the eldest brother, having fallen in battle), and
complained of the plots laid against him by the Arians, and of their opposition to the
apostolical faith460. He reminded him of his father, and how he attended in person the great
and famous council which he had summoned; how he was present at its debates, took part
in framing its decrees, and confirmed them by law. The emperor was moved to emulation
by his father’s zeal, and promptly wrote to his brother, exhorting him to preserve inviolate
the religion of their father, which they had inherited; “for,” he urged, “by piety he made his
empire great, destroyed the tyrants of Rome, and subjugated the foreign nations on every
side.” Constantius was led by this letter to summon the bishops from the east and from the

was accused by the unsound Arians of exciting seditions, and of such other crimes as they
usually laid to the charge of all those who preached true piety. The people, who feared the
machinations of his enemies, would not permit him to go to Sardica. The Arians, taking
advantage of the weakness of the emperor, procured from him an edict of banishment
against Paulus, who was, accordingly, sent to Cucusus, a little town formerly included in
Cappadocia, but now in Lesser Armenia. But these disturbers of the public peace were not
satisfied with having driven the admirable Paulus into a desert. They sent the agents of their
cruelty to despatch him by a violent death. St. Athanasius testifies to this fact in the defence
which he wrote of his own flight. He uses the following words463: “They pursued Paulus,
bishop of Constantinople, and having seized him at Cucusus, a city of Cappadocia, they had

<p>The Arians, having effected the death of Paulus, or rather having despatched him to the
kingdom of heaven, promoted Macedonius465 in his place, who, they imagined, held the
same sentiments, and belonged to the same faction as themselves, because he, like them,
blasphemed the Holy Ghost. But, shortly after, they deposed him also, because he refused
to call Him a creature Whom the Holy Scriptures affirm to be the Son of God. After his
separation from them, he became the leader of a sect of his own. He taught that the Son of
God is not of the same substance as the Father, but that He is like Him in every particular.
He also openly affirmed that the Holy Ghost is a creature. These circumstances occurred
not long afterwards as we have narrated them.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Council held at Sardica.</head>
<p>Two hundred and fifty bishops assembled at Sardica466, as is proved by ancient records.
The great Athanasius, Asclepas, bishop of Gaza, already mentioned467, and Marcellus468,
bishop of Ancyra, the metropolis of Galatia, who also held this bishopric at the time of the
council of Nicæa, all repaired thither. The calumniators, and the chiefs of the Arian faction,
who had previously judged the cause of Athanasius, also attended. But when they found
that the members of the synod were staunch in their adherence to sound doctrine, they
would not even enter the council, although they had been summoned to it, but fled away,
both accusers and judges. All these circumstances are far more clearly explained in a letter
drawn up by the council; and I shall therefore now insert it.</p>
<p>Synodical Letter from the Bishops assembled at Sardica, addressed to the other Bishops.</p>
<p>“The holy council assembled at Sardica, from Rome, Spain, Gaul, Italy, Campania, Calabria,
Africa, Sardinia, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia, Dardania, Lesser Dacia, Macedonia,
Thessaly, Achaia, Epirus, Thrace, Rhodope, Asia, Caria, Bithynia, the Hellespont, Phrygia,
Pisidia, Cappadocia, Pontus, the lesser Phrygia, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lydia, the Cyclades,
Egypt, the Thebaid, Libya, Galatia, Palestine and Arabia, to the bishops throughout the
world, our fellow-ministers in the catholic and apostolic Church, and our beloved brethren
in the Lord. Peace be unto you.</p>
<p>“The madness of the Arians has often led them to the perpetration of violent atrocities
against the servants of God who keep the true faith; they introduce false doctrines themselves,
and persecute those who uphold orthodox principles. So violent were their attacks on the
faith, that they reached the ears of our most pious emperors. Through the co-operation of
the grace of God, the emperors have summoned us from different provinces and cities to
the holy council which they have appointed to be held in the city of Sardica, in order that
all dissensions may be terminated, all evil doctrines expelled, and the religion of Christ alone
maintained amongst all people. Some bishops from the east have attended the council at
the solicitation of our most religious emperors, principally on account of the reports circu-

lated against our beloved brethren and fellow-ministers, Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria,
Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra in Galatia, and Asclepas, bishop of Gaza. Perhaps the calumnies
of the Arians have already reached you, and they have endeavoured thus to forestall the
council, and make you believe their groundless accusations of the innocent, and prevent
any suspicion being raised of the depraved heresy which they uphold. But they have not
long been permitted so to act. The Lord is the Protector of the churches; for them and for
us all He suffered death, and opened for us the way to heaven.</p>
<p>“The adherents of Eusebius, Maris, Theodorus, Theognis, Ursacius, Valens, Menophantus,
and Stephanus, had already written to Julius, the bishop of Rome, and our fellowminister,
against our aforesaid fellow-ministers, Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, Marcellus,
bishop of Ancyra in Galatia, and Asclepas, bishop of Gaza. Some bishops of the opposite
party wrote also to Julius, testifying to the innocence of Athanasius, and proving that all
that had been asserted by the followers of Eusebius was nothing more than lies and slander.
The refusal of the Arians to obey the summons of our beloved brother and fellow-ruler,
Julius, and also the letter written by that bishop, clearly prove the falseness of their accusation.
For, had they believed that what they had done and represented against our fellow-minister
admitted of justification, they would have gone to Rome. But their mode of procedure in
this great and holy council is a manifest proof of their fraud. Upon their arrival at Sardica,
they perceived that our brethren, Athanasius, Marcellus, Asclepas, and others, were there
also; they were therefore afraid to come to the test, although they had been summoned, not
once or twice only, but repeatedly. There were they waited for by the assembled bishops,
particularly by the venerable Hosius, one worthy of all honour and respect, on account of
his advanced age, his adherence to the faith, and his labours for the church. All urged them
to join the assembly and avail themselves of the opportunity of proving, in the presence of
their fellow-ministers, the truth of the charges they had brought against them in their absence,
both by word and by letter. But they refused to obey the summons, as we have already stated,
and so by their excesses proved the falsity of their statements, and all but proclaimed aloud
the plot and schemes they had formed. Men confident of the truth of their assertions are
always ready to stand to them openly. But as these accusers would not appear to substantiate
what they had advanced, any future allegations which they may by their usual artifices bring
against our fellow-ministers, will only be regarded as proceeding from a desire of slandering
them in their absence, without the courage to confront them openly.</p>
<p>“They fled, beloved brethren, not only because their charges were slander, but also because
they saw men arrive with serious and manifold accusations against themselves. Chains
and fetters were produced. Some were present whom they had exiled: others came forward
as representatives of those still kept in exile. There stood relations and friends of men whom

<pb n="154"/>
they had put to death. Most serious of all, bishops also appeared, one of whom469 exhibited
the irons and the chains with which they had laden him. Others testified that death followed
their false charges. For their infatuation had led them so far as even to attempt the life of a
bishop; and he would have been killed had he not escaped from their hands. Theodulus470,
our fellow-minister, of blessed memory, passed hence with their calumny on his name; for,
through it, he had been condemned to death. Some showed the wounds which had been
inflicted on them by the sword; others deposed that they had been exposed to the miseries
of famine.</p>
<p>“All these depositions were made, not by a few obscure individuals, but by whole
churches; the presbyters of these churches giving evidence that the persecutors had armed
the military against them with swords, and the common people with clubs; had employed
judicial threats, and produced spurious documents. The letters written by Theognis, for the
purpose of prejudicing the emperor against our fellow-ministers, Athanasius, Marcellus,
and Asclepas, were read and attested by those who had formerly been the deacons of
Theognis. It was also proved that they had stripped virgins naked, had burnt churches, and
imprisoned our fellow-ministers, and all because of the infamous heresy of the Ariomaniacs.
For thus all who refused to make common cause with them were treated.</p>
<p>“The consciousness of having committed all these crimes placed them in great straits.
Ashamed of their deeds, which could no longer be concealed, they repaired to Sardica,
thinking that their boldness in venturing thither would remove all suspicion of their guilt.
But when they perceived the presence of those whom they had falsely accused, and of those
who had suffered from their cruelty; and that likewise several had come with irrefragable
accusations against them, they would not enter the council. Our fellow-ministers, on the
other hand, Athanasius, Marcellus, and Asclepas, took every means to induce them to attend,
by tears, by urgency, by challenge, promising not only to prove the falsity of their accusations,
but also to show how deeply they had injured their own churches. But they were so overwhelmed
by the consciousness of their own evil deeds, that they took to flight, and by this
flight clearly proved the falsity of their accusations as well as their own guilt.</p>
<p>“But though their calumny and perfidy, which had indeed been apparent from the beginning,
were now clearly perceived, yet we determined to examine the circumstances of
the case according to the laws of truth, lest they should, from their very flight, derive pretexts
for renewed acts of deceitfulness.</p>
<note type="footnote">469 Probably Lucius, Bishop of Hadrianople, who had been deposed by the Arians, and appealed to Julius,
who wished to right him. Still kept out by the Arians, he appealed to the Council of Sardica, and, in accordance
with its decree, Constantius ordered his restoration (Soc. ii. 26). Cf. Chap. XII.</note>
<note type="footnote">470 Bishop of Trajanopolis (Ath. Hist. Ar. 19).</note>

<pb n="155"/>
<p>“Upon carrying this resolution into effect, we proved by their actions that they were
false accusers, and that they had formed plots against our fellow-ministers. Arsenius, whom
they declared had been put to death by Athanasius, is still alive, and takes his place among
the living. This fact alone is sufficient to show that their other allegations are false.</p>
<p>“Although they spread a report everywhere that a chalice had been broken by Macarius,
one of the presbyters of Athanasius, yet those who came from Alexandria, from Mareotis,
and from other places, testified that this was not the fact; and the bishops in Egypt wrote to
Julius, our fellow-minister, declaring that there was not the least suspicion that such a deed
had been done. The judicial facts which the Arians assert they possess against Macarius
have been all drawn up by one party; and in these documents the depositions of pagans and
of catechumens were included. One of these catechumens, when interrogated, replied that
he was in the church on the entry of Macarius. Another deposed that Ischyras, whom they
had talked about so much, was then lying ill in his cell. Hence it appears that the mysteries
could not have been celebrated at that time, as the catechumens were present, and as Ischyras
was absent; for he was at that very time confined by illness. Ischyras, that wicked man who
had falsely affirmed that Athanasius had burnt some of the sacred books, and had been
convicted of the crime, now confessed that he was ill in bed when Macarius arrived; hence
the falsehood of his accusation was clearly demonstrated. His calumny was, however, rewarded
by his party; they gave him the title of a bishop, although he was not yet even a presbyter.
For two presbyters came to the synod, who some time back had been attached to Meletius,
and were afterwards received back by the blessed Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, and are
now with Athanasius, protesting that he had never been ordained a presbyter, and that
Meletius had never had any church, or employed any minister in Mareotis. Yet, although
he had never been ordained a presbyter, they promote him to a bishopric, in order that his
title may impose upon those who hear his false accusations471.</p>
<p>“The writings of our fellow-minister, Marcellus, were also read, and plainly evinced the
duplicity of the adherents of Eusebius; for what Marcellus had simply suggested as a point
of inquiry, they accused him of professing as a point of faith. The statements which he had
made, both before and after the inquiry, were read, and his faith was proved to be orthodox.
He did not affirm, as they represented, that the beginning of the Word of God was dated
from His conception by the holy Mary, or that His kingdom would have an end. On the
contrary, he wrote that His kingdom had had no beginning, and would have no end. Asclepas,
our fellow-minister, produced the reports drawn up at Antioch in the presence of the ac-
<note type="footnote">471 The strange story of Ischyras is gathered from notices in the Apol. c. Arian. Without ordination, he started

and was recognised by them as a bishop. Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 302.</note>

cusers, and of Eusebius, bishop of Cæsarea, and proved his innocence by the sentence of
the bishops who had presided as judges.</p>
<p>“It was not then without cause, beloved brethren, that, although so frequently summoned,
they would not attend the council; it was not without cause that they took to flight. The reproaches
of conscience constrained them to make their escape, and thus, at the same time,
to demonstrate the groundlessness of their calumnies, and the truth of those accusations
which were advanced and proved against them. Besides all the other grounds of complaint,
it may be added that all those who had been accused of holding the Arian heresy, and had
been ejected in consequence, were not only received, but advanced to the highest dignities
by them. They raised deacons to the presbyterate, and thence to the episcopate; and in all
this they were actuated by no other motive than the desire of propagating and diffusing
their heresy, and of corrupting the true faith.</p>
<p>“Next to Eusebius, the following are their principal leaders; Theodorus, bishop of Heraclea,
Narcissus, bishop of Neronias in Cilicia, Stephanus, bishop of Antioch, Georgius472,
bishop of Laodicea, Acacius473, bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, Menophantus, bishop of
Ephesus in Asia, Ursacius, bishop of Singidunum474 in Moesia, and Valens, bishop of
Mursa475 in Pannonia. These bishops forbade those who came with them from the east to
attend the holy council, or to unite with the Church of God. On their road to Sardica they
held private assemblies at different places, and formed a compact cemented by threats, that,
when they arrived in Sardica, they would not join the holy council, nor assist at its deliberations;
arranging that, as soon as they had arrived they should present themselves for form’s
sake, and forthwith betake themselves to flight. These facts were made known to us by our
fellow-ministers, Macarius of Palestine476, and Asterius of Arabia477, who came with them
to Sardica, but refused to share their unorthodoxy. These bishops complained before the
holy council of the violent treatment they had received from them, and of the want of right
principles evinced in all their transactions. They added that there were many amongst them

and that sometimes threats, sometimes promises, were resorted to, in order to retain them

<p>“It is not right to pass over in silence and without rebuke the calumnies, the imprisonments,
the murders, the stripes, the forged letters, the indignities, the stripping naked of
virgins, the banishments, the destruction of churches, the acts of incendiarism, the translation
of bishops from small towns to large dioceses, and above all, the ill-starred Arian heresy,
raised by their means against the true faith. For these causes, therefore, we declare the innocence
and purity of our beloved brethren and fellow-ministers, Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria,
Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra in Galatia, and Asclepas, bishop of Gaza, and of all the
other servants of God who are with them; and we have written to each of their dioceses, in
order that the people of each church may be made acquainted with the innocence of their
respective bishops, and that they may recognise them alone and wait for their return. Men
who have come down on their churches like wolves478, such as Gregorius in Alexandria,
Basilius in Ancyra, and Quintianus479 in Gaza, we charge them not even to call bishops,
nor yet Christians, nor to have any communion with them, nor to receive any letters from
them, nor to write to them.</p>

infatuation of the Arians), have on account of their various crimes been cast forth from

from the Father, ought to be separated from the Catholic Church, and alienated from all
who bear the name of Christians. Let them then be anathema to you, and to all the faithful,

<p>“We declare those men excommunicate from the Catholic Church who say that Christ
is God, but not the true God; that He is the Son, but not the true Son; and that He is both
begotten and made; for such persons acknowledge that they understand by the term ‘begotten,’
that which has been made; and because, although the Son of God existed before all
ages, they attribute to Him, who exists not in time but before all time, a beginning and an

and rose again; and they pertinaciously maintain, like the heretics, that the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost are of diverse and distinct essences483. We have been taught, and we
hold the catholic and apostolic tradition and faith and confession which teach, that the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost have one essence, which is termed substance484 by the
heretics. If it is asked, ‘What is the essence of the Son?’ we confess, that it is that which is
acknowledged to be that of the Father alone; for the Father has never been, nor could ever
be, without the Son, nor the Son without the Father. It is most absurd to affirm that the
Father ever existed without the Son, for that this could never be so has been testified by the
Son Himself, who said, ‘I am in the Father, and the Father in Me485;’ and ‘I and My Father
are one486.’ None of us denies that He was begotten; but we say that He was begotten before
all things, whether visible or invisible; and that He is the Creator of archangels and angels,

has no beginning, and God will never have an end. We do not say that the Father is Son,
nor that the Son is Father; but that the Father is Father, and the Son of the Father Son. We
confess that the Son is Power of the Father. We confess that the Word is Word of God the
Father, and that beside Him there is no other. We believe the Word to be the true God, and
Wisdom and Power. We affirm that He is truly the Son, yet not in the way in which others
are said to be sons: for they are either gods by reason of their regeneration, or are called
sons of God on account of their merit, and not on account of their being of one essence489,
as is the case with the Father and the Son. We confess an Only-begotten and a Firstborn;
but that the Word is only-begotten, who ever was and is in the Father. We use the word
firstborn with respect to His human nature. But He is superior (to man) in the new creation490
(of the Resurrection), inasmuch as He is the Firstborn from the dead.</p>
<p>“We confess that God is; we confess the divinity of the Father and of the Son to be one.
No one denies that the Father is greater than the Son: not on account of another essence491,
nor yet on account of their difference, but simply from the very name of the Father being
greater than that of the Son. The words uttered by our Lord, ‘I and My Father are one492,’
are by those men explained as referring to the concord and harmony which prevail between
the Father and the Son; but this is a blasphemous and perverse interpretation. We, as
Catholics, unanimously condemned this foolish and lamentable opinion: for just as mortal
men on a difference having arisen between them quarrel and afterwards are reconciled, so
do such interpreters say that disputes and dissension are liable to arise between God the
Father Almighty and His Son; a supposition which is altogether absurd and untenable. But
we believe and maintain that those holy words, ‘I and My Father are one,’ point out the
oneness of essence493 which is one and the same in the Father and in the Son.</p>

apostles received the Holy Spirit of God, and yet there were none amongst them who were
the Spirit, neither was there any one of them who was Word, Wisdom, Power, or Only-begotten.
‘As Thou,’ He said, ‘and I are one, that they, may be one in us.’ These holy words,
‘that they may be one in us,’ are strictly accurate: for the Lord did not say, ‘one in the same
way that I and the Father are one,’ but He said, ‘that the disciples, being knit together and
united, may be one in faith and in confession, and so in the grace and piety of God the
Father, and by the indulgence and love of our Lord Jesus Christ, may be able to become

<p>Constans was much concerned on hearing of the easy temper of his brother, and was
highly incensed against those who had contrived this plot and artfully taken advantage of
it. He chose two of the bishops who had attended the council of Sardica, and sent them with
letters to his brother; he also despatched Salianus, a military commander who was celebrated
for his piety and integrity, on the same embassy. The letters which he forwarded by them,
and which were worthy of himself, contained not only entreaties and counsels, but also
menaces. In the first place, he charged his brother to attend to all that the bishops might
say, and to take cognizance of the crimes of Stephanus and of his accomplices. He also required
him to restore Athanasius to his flock; the calumny of the accusers and the injustice
and ill-will of his former judges having become evident. He added, that if he would not accede
to his request, and perform this act of justice, he would himself go to Alexandria, restore
Athanasius to his flock which earnestly longed for him, and expel all opponents.</p>

that his brother commanded.</p>
<note type="footnote">note) writes: “The word οἰκονομία came to be applied more especially to the Incarnation because this was par
excellence the system or plan which God had ordained for the government of His household and the dispensation
of His stores. Hence in the province of theology, οἰκονομία was distinguished by the Fathers from θεολογία
proper, the former being the teaching which was concerned with the Incarnation and its consequences, and the
latter the teaching which related to the Eternal and Divine nature of Christ. The first step towards this special
appropriation of οἰκονομία to the Incarnation is found in St. Paul; e.g. Ephes. i. 10, εἰς οἰκονομίαν τοῦ
πληρώματος τῶν καιρῶν.…In this passage of Ignatius it is moreover connected with the ‘reserve’ of God (xix.
εν ἡσυχίU+0026 139· θεοῦ ἐπράχθη). Thus ‘economy’ has already reached its first stage on the way to the sense of
‘dissimulation,’ which was afterwards connected with it, and which led to disastrous consequences in the theology
and practice of a later age.” Cf. Newman’s Arians, chap. i. sec. 3.</note>

<head>Chapter VII.—Account of the Bishops Euphratas and Vincentius, and of the plot formed in
Antioch against them.</head>
<p>The wonted opponents of the truth were so much displeased at these proceedings, that
they planned a notoriously execrable and impious crime.</p>
<p>The two bishops resided near the foot of the mountain, while the military commander
had settled in a lodging in another quarter.</p>
<p>At this period Stephanus held the rudder of the church of Antioch, and had well nigh
sunk the ship, for he employed several tools in his despotic doings, and by their aid involved
all who maintained orthodox doctrines in manifold calamities. The leader of these instruments
was a young man of a rash and reckless character, who led a very infamous life. He
not only dragged away men from the market-place, and treated them with blows and insult,
but had the audacity to enter private houses, whence he carried off men and women of irreproachable
character. But, not to be too prolix in relating his crimes, I will merely narrate
his daring conduct towards the bishops; for this alone is sufficient to give an idea of the
unlawful deeds of violence which he perpetrated against the citizens. He went to one of the
lowest women of the town, and told her that some strangers had just arrived, who desired
to pass the night with her. He took fifteen of his band, placed them in hiding among the
stone walls at the bottom of the hill, and then went for the prostitute. After giving the preconcerted
signal, and learning that the folk privy to the plot were on the spot, he went to
the gate of the courtyard belonging to the inn where the bishops were lodging. The doors
were opened by one of the household servants, who had been bribed by him. He then conducted
the woman into the house, pointed out to her the door of the room where one of
the bishops slept, and desired her to enter. Then he went out to call his accomplices. The
door which he had pointed out happened to be that of Euphratas, the elder bishop, whose
room was the outer of the two. Vincentius, the other bishop, occupied the inner room.
When the woman entered the room of Euphratas, he heard the sound of her footsteps, and,
as it was then dark, asked who was there. She spoke, and Euphratas was full of alarm, for
he thought that it was a devil imitating the voice of a woman, and he called upon Christ the
Saviour for aid. Onager, for this was the name of the leader of this wicked band (a name496
peculiarly appropriate to him, as he not only used his hands but also his feet as weapons
against the pious), had in the meantime returned with his lawless crew, denouncing as
criminals those who were expecting to be judges of crime themselves. At the noise which
was made all the servants came running in, and up got Vincentius. They closed the gate of
the courtyards, and captured seven of the gang; but Onager and the rest made off. The woman
was committed to custody with those who had been seized. At the break of day the bishops
awoke the officer who had come with them, and they all three proceeded together to the
<note type="footnote">496 ῎Οναγρος = wild ass</note>

<pb n="163"/>
palace, to complain of the audacious acts of Stephanus, whose evil deeds, they said, were
too evident to need either trial or torture to prove them. The general loudly demanded of
the emperor that the audacious act should not be dealt with synodically, but by ordinary
legal process, and offered to give up the clergy attached to the bishops to be first examined,
and declared that the agents of Stephanus must undergo the torture too. To this Stephanus
insolently objected, alleging that the clergy ought not to be scourged. The emperor and the
principal authorities then decided that it would be better to judge the cause in the palace.
The woman was first of all questioned, and was asked by whom she was conducted to the
inn where the bishops were lodging. She replied, that a young man came to her, and told
her that some strangers had arrived who were desirous of her company; that in the evening
he conducted her to the inn; that he went to look for his band, and when he had found it,
brought her in through the door of the court, and desired her to go into the chamber adjoining
the vestibule. She added, that the bishop asked who was there; that he was alarmed; and
that he began to pray; and that then others ran to the spot.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Stephanus Deposed.</head>
<p>After the judges had heard these replies, they ordered the youngest of those who had
been arrested to be brought before them. Before he was subjected to the examination by
scourging, he confessed the whole plot, and stated that it was planned and carried into execution
by Onager. On this latter being brought in he affirmed that he had only acted according
to the commands of Stephanus. The guilt of Stephanus being thus demonstrated, the
bishops then present were charged to depose him, and expel him from the Church. By his
expulsion the Church was not, however, wholly freed from the plague of Arianism. Leontius,
who succeeded him in his presidency, was a Phrygian of so subtle and artful a disposition,
that he might be said to resemble the sunken rocks of the sea497. We shall presently narrate
more concerning him498.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Second Return of Saint Athanasius.</head>
<p>The emperor Constantius, having become acquainted with the plots formed against the
bishops, wrote to the great Athanasius once, and twice, aye and thrice, exhorting him to
return from the West499. I shall here insert the second letter, because it is the shortest of the
three.</p>
<p>Constantius Augustus the Conqueror to Athanasius.</p>
<p>“Although I have already apprised you by previous letters, that you can, without fear of
molestation, return to our court, in order that you may, according to my ardent desire, be
reinstated in your own bishopric, yet I now again despatch another letter to your gravity to
exhort you to take immediately, without fear or suspicion, a public vehicle and return to
us, in order that you may receive all that you desire.”</p>
<p>When Athanasius returned, Constantius received him with kindness, and bade him go
back to the Church of Alexandria500. But there were some attached to the court, infected
with the errors of Arianism, who maintained that Athanasius ought to cede one church to
those who were unwilling to hold communion with him. On this being mentioned to the
emperor, and by the emperor to Athanasius, he remarked, that the imperial command appeared
to be just; but that he also wished to make a request. The emperor readily promising
to grant him whatever he might ask, he said that those in Antioch501 who objected to hold
communion with the party now in possession of the churches wanted temples to pray in,
and that it was only fair that one House of God also be assigned to them. This request was
deemed just and reasonable by the emperor; but the leaders of the Arian faction resisted its
being carried into execution, maintaining that neither party ought to have the churches assigned
to them. Constantius on this was struck with high admiration for Athanasius, and
sent him back to Alexandria502. Gregorius was dead, having met his end at the hands of the
Alexandrians themselves503. The people kept high holiday in honour of their pastor; feasting

<head>Chapter X.—Third exile and flight of Athanasius.</head>
<p>Those who had obtained entire ascendency over the mind of Constantius, and influenced
him as they pleased, reminded him that Athanasius had been the cause of the differences
between his brother and himself, which had nearly led to the rupture of the bonds of nature,
and the kindling of a civil war. Constantius was induced by these representations not only
to banish, but also to condemn the holy Athanasius to death; and he accordingly despatched
Sebastianus506, a military commander, with a very large body of soldiery to slay him, as if
he had been a criminal. How the one led the attack and the other escaped will be best told
in the words of him who so suffered and was so wonderfully saved.</p>
<p>Thus Athanasius writes in his Apology for his Flight:—“Let the circumstances of my
retreat be investigated, and the testimony of the opposite faction be collected; for Arians
accompanied the soldiers, as well for the purpose of spurring them on, as of pointing me
out to those who did not know me. If they are not touched with sympathy at the tale I tell,
at least let them listen in the silence of shame. It was night, and some of the people were
keeping vigil, for a communion507 was expected. A body of soldiers suddenly advanced
upon them, consisting of a general508 and five thousand armed men with naked swords,
bows and arrows, and clubs, as I have already stated. The general surrounded the church,
posting his men in close order, that those within might be prevented from going out. I
deemed that I ought not in such a time of confusion to leave the people, but that I ought
rather to be the first to meet the danger; so I sat down on my throne and desired the deacon
to read a psalm, and the people to respond, ‘For His mercy endureth for ever.’ Then I bade
them all return to their own houses. But now the general with the soldiery forced his way
into the church, and surrounded the sanctuary in order to arrest me. The clergy and the
laity who had remained clamorously besought me to withdraw. This I firmly refused to do
until all the others had retreated. I rose, had a prayer offered, and directed all the people to
retire. ‘It is better,’ said I, ‘for me to meet the danger alone, than for any of you to be hurt.’
When the greater number of the people had left the church, and just as the rest were following,
the monks and some of the clergy who had remained came up and drew me out. And
so, may the truth be my witness, the Lord leading and protecting me, we passed through
the midst of the soldiers, some of whom were stationed around the sanctuary, and others
marching about the church. Thus I went out unperceived, and fervently thanked God that

<head>Chapter XI.—The evil and daring deeds done by Georgius510 in Alexandria.</head>
<p>Athanasius having thus escaped the bloodstained hands of his adversaries, Georgius,
who was truly another wolf, was entrusted with authority over the flock. He treated the
sheep with more cruelty than wolf, or bear, or leopard could have shewn. He compelled
young women who had vowed perpetual virginity, not only to disown the communion of
Athanasius, but also to anathematize the faith of the fathers. The agent in his cruelty was
Sebastianus, an officer in command of troops. He ordered a fire to be kindled in the centre
of the city, and placed the virgins, who were stripped naked, close to it, commanding them
to deny the faith. Although they formed a most sorrowful and pitiable spectacle for believers
as well as for unbelievers, they considered that all these dishonours conferred the highest
honour on them; and they joyfully received the blows inflicted on them on account of their
faith. All these facts shall be more clearly narrated by their own pastor.</p>
<p>“About Lent, Georgius returned from Cappadocia, and added to the evils which he had
been taught by our enemies. After the Easter week virgins were cast into prison, bishops
were bound and dragged away by the soldiers, the homes of widows and of orphans were
pillaged, robbery and violence went on from house to house, and the Christians during the
darkness of night were seized and torn away from their dwellings. Seals were fixed on many
houses. The brothers of the clergy were in peril for their brothers’ sake. These cruelties were
very atrocious, but still more so were those which were subsequently perpetrated. In the
week following the holy festival of Pentecost, the people who were keeping a fast came out
to the cemetery511 to pray, because they all renounced any communion with Georgius. This
vilest of men was informed of this circumstance, and he incited Sebastianus the military
commander, a Manichean512, to attack the people; and, accordingly, on the Lord’s day itself
he rushed upon them with a large body of armed soldiers wielding naked swords, and bows,
and arrows. He found but few Christians in the act of praying, for most of them had retired
on account of the lateness of the hour. Then he did such deeds as might be expected from
one who had lent his ears to such teachers. He ordered a large fire to be lighted, and the
<note type="footnote">510 Georgius, a fraudulent contractor of Constantinople (Ath. Hist. Ar. 75), made Arian Bishop of Alexandria
on the expulsion of Athanasius, in a.d. 356, was born in a fuller’s shop at Epiphania in Cilicia. (Amm. Marc.
xxii. 11, 3.) He was known as “the Cappadocian,” and further illustrates the old saying of “Καππάδοκες Κρήτες
Κίλικες, τρία κάππα κάκιστα,” and the kindred epigram Καππαδόκην ποτ᾽ ἔχιδνα κακὴ δάκεν· U+0026 135·λλὰ καὶ

virgins to be brought close to it, and then tried to compel them to declare themselves of the
Arian creed. When he perceived that they were conquering, and giving no heed to the fire,
he ordered them to be stripped naked, and to be beaten until their faces for a long while
were scarcely recognisable. He then seized forty men, and inflicted on them a new kind of
torture. He ordered them to be scourged with branches of palm-trees, retaining their thorns;
and by these their flesh was so lacerated that some because of the thorns fixed fast in them
had again and again to put themselves under the surgeon’s hand; others were not able to
bear the agony and died. All who survived, and also the virgins, were then banished to the
Greater Oasis. They even refused to give up the bodies of the dead to their kinsfolk for
burial, but flung them away unburied, and hid them just as they pleased, in order that it
might appear that they had nothing to do with these cruel transactions, and were ignorant
of them. But they were deceived in this foolish expectation: for the friends of the slain, while
they rejoiced at the faithfulness of the deceased, deeply lamented the loss of the corpses, and
spread abroad a full account of the cruelty that had been perpetrated.</p>
<p>“The following bishops were banished from Egypt and from Libya:—Ammonius, Muïus,
Caius, Philo, Hermes, Plenius, Psinosiris, Nilammon, Agapius, Anagamphus, Marcus,
Dracontius, Adelphius, another Ammonius, another Marcus, and Athenodorus; and also
the presbyters Hierax and Dioscorus513. These were all driven into exile in so cruel a manner
that many died on the road, and others at the place of their banishment. The persecutors
caused the death514 of more than thirty bishops. For, like Ahab, their mind was set on
rooting out the truth, had it been possible515.”</p>
<p>Athanasius also, in a letter addressed to the virgins516 who were treated with so much
barbarity, uses the following words: “Let none of you be grieved although these impious
heretics grudge you burial and prevent your corpses being carried forth. The impiety of the

to the Upper Oasis (id.). Caius was the orthodox bishop of Thmuis. Philo was banished to Babylon (Hist. Ar.

Zygra and Philæ), and Athenodorus, were relegated to the parts about the Libyan Ammon, nine days’ journey
from Alexandria, only that they might perish on the road. One did die. (Hist Ar. §72.) Adelphius was bishop of
Onuphis in the Delta, and was sent to the Thebaid. (Tom. ad Ant. 615.) Dracontius, to whom Athanasius addressed
a letter, went to the deserts about Clysma (25 m. s.w. of Suez), and Hierax and Dioscorus to Syene (Assouan

<head>Chapter XII.—Council of Milan.</head>
<p>After the death of Constans, Magnentius assumed the chief authority over the Western
empire; and, to repress his usurpation, Constantius repaired to Europe. But this war, severe
as it was, did not put an end to the war against the Church. Constantius, who had embraced
Arian tenets and readily yielded to the influence of others, was persuaded to convoke a
council at Milan517, a city of Italy, and first to compel all the assembled bishops to sign the
deposition enacted by the iniquitous judges at Tyre; and then, since Athanasius had been
expelled from the Church, to draw up another confession of faith. The bishops assembled
in council on the receipt of the imperial letter, but they were far from acting according to
its directions. On the contrary, they told the emperor to his face that what he had commanded
was unjust and impious. For this act of courage they were expelled from the Church, and
relegated to the furthest boundaries of the empire.</p>
<p>The admirable Athanasius thus mentions this circumstance in his Apology518:—“Who,”
he writes, “can narrate such atrocities as they have perpetrated? A short time ago when the
Churches were in the enjoyment of peace, and when the people were assembled for prayer,
Liberius519, bishop of Rome, Paulinus, bishop of the metropolis of Gaul520, Dionysius,
bishop of the metropolis of Italy521, Luciferus, bishop of the metropolis of the Isles of
Sardinia522, and Eusebius, bishop of one of the cities of Italy523, who were all exemplary
bishops and preachers of the truth, were seized and driven into exile, for no other cause
than because they could not assent to the Arian heresy, nor sign the false accusation which
had been framed against us. It is unnecessary that I should speak of the great Hosius, that
<note type="footnote">517 Athanasius was condemned at Arles (353) as well as at Milan in 355. At the latter place Constantius affected

banishment. Of all the bishops he is the most illustrious. What council can be mentioned
in which he did not preside, and convince all present by the power of his reasoning? What
Church does not still retain the glorious memorials of his protection? Did any one ever go

all that he desired? Yet they had the boldness to attack this great man, simply because, from
his knowledge of the impiety of their calumnies, he refused to affix his signature to their
artful accusations against us.”</p>
<p>From the above narrative will be seen the violence of the Arians against these holy men.
Athanasius also gives in the same book an account of the numerous plots formed by the
chiefs of the Arian faction against many others:—“Did any one,” said he, “whom they persecuted
and got into their power ever escape from them without suffering what injuries they
pleased to inflict? Was any one who was an object of their search found by them whom they
did not subject to the most agonizing death, or else to the mutilation of all his limbs? The
sentences inflicted by the judges are all attributable to these heretics; for the judges are but
the agents of their will, and of their malice. Where is there a place which contains no memorial
of their atrocities? If any one ever differed from them in opinion, did they not, like
Jezebel, falsely accuse and oppress him? Where is there a church which has not been plunged

<head>Chapter XIII.—Conference between Liberius, Pope of Rome, and the Emperor Constantius537.</head>
<p>Constantius.—“We have judged it right, as you are a Christian and the bishop of our
city, to send for you in order to admonish you to abjure all connexion with the folly of the
impious Athanasius. For when he was separated from the communion of the Church by
the synod the whole world approved of the decision.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“O Emperor, ecclesiastical sentences ought to be enacted with strictest justice:
therefore, if it be pleasing to your piety, order the court to be assembled, and if it be seen
that Athanasius deserves condemnation, then let sentence be passed upon him according
to ecclesiastical forms. For it is not possible for us to condemn a man unheard and untried.”</p>
<p>Constantius.—“The whole world has condemned his impiety; but he, as he has done
from the first, laughs at the danger.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Those who signed the condemnation were not eye-witnesses of anything
that occurred; but were actuated by the desire of glory, and by the fear of disgrace at thy
hands.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“What do you mean by glory and fear and disgrace?”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Those who love not the glory of God, but who attach greater value to thy
gifts, have condemned a man whom they have neither seen nor judged; this is very contrary
to the principles of Christians.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“Athanasius was tried in person at the council of Tyre, and all the
bishops of the world at that synod condemned him.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“No judgment has ever been passed on him in his presence. Those who there
assembled condemned him after he had retired.”</p>
<p>Eusebius the Eunuch538 foolishly interposed.—“It was demonstrated at the council of
Nicæa that he held opinions entirely at variance with the catholic faith.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Of all those who sailed to Mareotis, and who were sent for the purpose of
drawing up memorials against the accused, five only delivered the sentence against him. Of
the five who were thus sent, two are now dead, namely, Theognis and Theodorus. The three
others, Maris, Valens, and Ursacius, are still living. Sentence was passed at Sardica against
all those who were sent for this purpose to Mareotis. They presented a petition to the
council soliciting pardon for having drawn up at Mareotis memorials against Athanasius,
consisting of false accusations and depositions of only one party. Their petition is still in

our hands. Whose cause are we to espouse, O Emperor? With whom are we to agree and
hold communion? With those who first condemned Athanasius, and then solicited pardon
for having condemned him, or with those who have condemned these latter?”</p>
<p>Epictetus539 the Bishop.—“O Emperor, it is not on behalf of the faith, nor in defence
of ecclesiastical judgments that Liberius is pleading; but merely in order that he may boast
before the Roman senators of having conquered the emperor in argument.”</p>
<p>The Emperor (addressing Liberius).—“What portion do you constitute of the universe,
that you alone by yourself take part with an impious man, and are destroying the peace of
the empire and of the whole world?”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“My standing alone does not make the truth a whit the weaker. According
to the ancient story, there are found but three men resisting a decree.”</p>
<p>Eusebius the Eunuch.—“You make our emperor a Nebuchadnezzar.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“By no means. But you rashly condemn a man without any trial. What I desire
is, in the first place, that a general confession of faith be signed, confirming that drawn up
at the council of Nicæa. And secondly, that all our brethren be recalled from exile, and reinstated
in their own bishoprics. If, when all this has been carried into execution, it can be
shown that the doctrines of all those who now fill the churches with trouble are conformable
to the apostolic faith, then we will all assemble at Alexandria to meet the accused, the accusers,
and their defender, and after having examined the cause, we will pass judgment upon it.”</p>
<p>Epictetus the Bishop.—“There will not be sufficient post-carriages to convey so many
bishops.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Ecclesiastical affairs can be transacted without post-carriages. The churches
are able to provide means for the conveyance of their respective bishops to the sea coast540.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“The sentence which has once been passed ought not to be revoked.
The decision of the greater number of bishops ought to prevail. You alone retain friendship
towards that impious man.”</p>
<note type="footnote">539 Bishop of Centumcellæ (Civita Vecchia); “a bold young fellow, ready for any mischief.” A protégé of the

“The Christian religion, which in itself is plain and simple, Constantius confounded by the dotage of superstition.
Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority, he cherished and propagated, by verbal disputes,
the differences which his vain curiosity had excited. The highways were covered with troops of bishops galloping
from every side to the assemblies which they call synods; and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to
their own particular opinions, the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated
journeys.” Gibbon, chap. xx.</note>

<pb n="177"/>
<p>Liberius.—“O Emperor, it is a thing hitherto unheard of, that a judge should accuse the
absent of impiety, as if he were his personal enemy.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“All without exception have been injured by him, but none so deeply
as I have been. Not content with the death of my eldest brother541, he never ceased to excite
Constans, of blessed memory, to enmity against me; but I, with much moderation, put up
alike with the vehemence of both the instigator and his victim. Not one of the victories
which I have gained, not even excepting those over Magnentius and Silvanus, equals the
ejection of this vile man from the government of the Church.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Do not vindicate your own hatred and revenge, O Emperor, by the instrumentality
of bishops; for their hands ought only to be raised for purposes of blessing and
of sanctification. If it be consonant with your will, command the bishops to return to their
own residences; and if it appear that they are of one mind with him who to-day maintains
the true doctrines of the confession of faith signed at Nicæa, then let them come together
and see to the peace of the world, in order that an innocent man may not serve as a mark
for reproach.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“One question only requires to be made. I wish you to enter into communion
with the churches, and to send you back to Rome. Consent therefore to peace, and
sign your assent, and then you shall return to Rome.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“I have already taken leave of the brethren who are in that city. The decrees
of the Church are of greater importance than a residence in Rome.”</p>
<p>The Emperor.—“You have three days to consider whether you will sign the document
and return to Rome; if not, you must choose the place of your banishment.”</p>
<p>Liberius.—“Neither three days nor three months can change my sentiments. Send me
wherever you please.”</p>
<p>After the lapse of two days the emperor sent for Liberius, and finding his opinions unchanged,
he commanded him to be banished to Beroea, a city of Thrace. Upon the departure
of Liberius, the emperor sent him five hundred pieces of gold to defray his expenses.
Liberius said to the messenger who brought them, “Go, and give them back to the emperor;
he has need of them to pay his troops.” The empress542 also sent him a sum of the same
amount; he said, “Take it to the emperor, for he may want it to pay his troops; but if not,
let it be given to Auxentius and Epictetus, for they stand in need of it.” Eusebius the eunuch
brought him other sums of money, and he thus addressed him: “You have turned all the

<head>Chapter XIV.—Concerning the Banishment and Return of the Holy Liberius.</head>
<p>This victorious champion of the truth was sent into Thrace, according to the imperial
order. Two years after this event Constantius went to Rome. The ladies of rank urged their
husbands to petition the emperor for the restoration of the shepherd to his flock: they added,
that if this were not granted, they would desert them, and go themselves after their great
pastor. Their husbands replied, that they were afraid of incurring the resentment of the
emperor. “If we were to ask him,” they continued, “being men, he would deem it an unpardonable
offence; but if you were yourselves to present the petition, he would at any rate
spare you, and would either accede to your request, or else dismiss you without injury.”
These noble ladies adopted this suggestion, and presented themselves before the emperor
in all their customary splendour of array, that so the sovereign, judging their rank from
their dress, might count them worthy of being treated with courtesy and kindness. Thus
entering the presence, they besought him to take pity on the condition of so large a city,
deprived of its shepherd, and made an easy prey to the attacks of wolves. The emperor
replied, that the flock possessed a shepherd capable of tending it, and that no other was
needed in the city. For after the banishment of the great Liberius, one of his deacons, named
Felix, had been appointed bishop. He preserved inviolate the doctrines set forth in the Nicene
confession of faith, yet he held communion with those who had corrupted that faith. For
this reason none of the citizens of Rome would enter the House of Prayer while he was in
it. The ladies mentioned these facts to the emperor. Their persuasions were successful; and
he commanded that the great Liberius should be recalled from exile, and that the two bishops
should conjointly rule the Church. The edict of the emperor was read in the circus, and the
multitude shouted that the imperial ordinance was just; that the spectators were divided
into two factions, each deriving its name from its own colours544, and that each faction
would now have its own bishop. After having thus ridiculed the edict of the emperor, they
all exclaimed with one voice, “One God, one Christ, one bishop.” I have deemed it right to
set down their precise words. Some time after this Christian people had uttered these pious
and righteous acclamations, the holy Liberius returned, and Felix retired to another city.</p>
<p>I have, for the sake of preserving order, appended this narrative to what relates to the
proceedings of the bishops at Milan. I shall now return to the relation of events in their due
course.</p>
<note type="footnote">544 There were originally four factions in the Circus; blue, green, white, and red. Domitian added two more,
golden and purple. But the blue and the green absorbed the rest, and divided the multitude at the games. Cf.
Juv. XI. 197. “Totam hodie Romam circus capit, et fragor aurem Percutit, eventum viridis quo colligo panni.”

<head>Chapter XV.—Council of Ariminum545.</head>
<p>When all who defended the faith had been removed, those who moulded the mind of
the emperor according to their own will, flattering themselves that the faith which they opposed
might be easily subverted, and Arianism established in its stead, persuaded Constantius
to convene the Bishops of both East and West at Ariminum546, in order to remove from
the Creed the terms which had been devised by the Fathers to counteract the corrupt craft
of Arius,—“substance547,” and “of one substance548.” For they would have it that these
terms had caused dissension between church and church. On their assembling in synod the
partizans of the Arian faction strove to trick the majority of the bishops, especially those of
cities of the Western Empire, who were men of simple and unsophisticated ways. The body
of the Church, they argued again and again, must not be torn asunder for the sake of two
terms which are not to be found in the Bible; and, while they confessed the propriety of describing
the Son as in all things “like” the Father, pressed the omission of the word “substance”
as unscriptural. The motives, however, of the propounders of these views were seen through
by the Council, and they were consequently repudiated. The orthodox bishops declared
their mind to the emperor in a letter; for, said they, we are sons and heirs of the Fathers of
the Council of Nicæa, and if we were to have the hardihood to take away anything from
what was by them subscribed, or to add anything to what they so excellently settled, we
should declare ourselves no true sons, but accusers of them that begat us. But the exact terms
of their confession of faith will be more accurately given in the words of their letter to
Constantius.</p>

both received and abandoned, and they actually effected the adoption of the ‘like in all things according to the
Scriptures,’ a phrase in which the semi-Arians, indeed, included their ‘like in substance’ or Homoeüsion, but
which did not necessarily refer to substance or nature at all. Under these circumstances the two Councils met
in the autumn of a.d. 359, under the nominal superintendence of the semi-Arians; but, on the Eusebian side,
the sharp-witted Acacius undertaking to deal with the disputatious Greeks, the overbearing and cruel Valens
with the plainer Latins.” (Newman, Arians, iv. §4.) At Seleucia there were 150 bishops; at Ariminum 400.</note>

<p>“Summoned, we believe, at the bidding of God, and in obedience to your piety, we
bishops of the Western Church assembled in synod at Ariminum in order that the faith of
the Church Catholic might be set forth, and its opponents exposed. After long consideration
we have found it to be plainly best for us to hold fast and guard, and by guarding keep safe
unto the end, the faith established from the first, preached by Prophets, and Evangelists,
and Apostles, through our Lord Jesus Christ, warden of thy empire, and champion of thy
salvation. For it is plainly absurd and unlawful to make any change in the doctrines rightly
and justly defined, and in matters examined at Nicæa with the cognisance of the right glorious
Constantine, thy Father and Emperor, whereof the teaching and spirit was published
and preached that mankind might hear and understand. This faith was destined to be the
one rival and destroyer of the Arian heresy, and by it not only the Arian itself, but likewise
all other heresies were undone. To this faith to add aught is verily perilous; from it to subtract
aught is to run great risk. If it have either addition or loss, our foes will feel free to act as
they please. Accordingly Ursacius and Valens, declared adherents and friends of the Arian
dogma, were pronounced separate from our communion. To keep their place in it, they
asked to be granted a locus penitentiæ and pardon for all the points wherein they had owned
themselves in error; as is testified by the documents written by themselves, by means of
which they obtained favour and forgiveness. These events were going on at the very time
when the synod was meeting at Milan, the presbyters of the church of Rome being also
present. It was known that Constantine, who, though dead, is worthy of remembrance, had,
with all exactitude and care, set forth the creed drawn up: and now that, after receiving
Baptism, he was dead, and had passed away to the peace which he deserved. We judged it
absurd for us after him to indulge in any innovation, and throw a slur on all the holy confessors
and martyrs who had devised and formulated this doctrine, in that their minds have
ever remained bound by the old bond of the Church. Their faith God has handed down
even to the times of thy own reign, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whose grace such
empire is thine that thou rulest over all the world. Yet again those pitiable and wretched
men, with lawless daring, have proclaimed themselves preachers of their unholy opinion,
and are taking in hand the overthrow of all the force of the truth. For when at thy command
the synod assembled, then they laid bare their own disingenuous desires. For they set about
trying through villany and confusion to make innovation. They got hold of certain of their

<pb n="182"/>
own following—one Germanius550, and Auxentius551, and Caius552, promoters of heresy
and discord, whose doctrine, though but one, transcends a very host of blasphemies. When,
however, they became aware that we were not of their way of thinking, nor in sympathy
with their vicious projects, they made their way into our meeting as though to make some
other proposal, but a very short time was enough to convict them of their real intentions.
Therefore in order to save the management of the Church from falling from time to time
into the same difficulties, and to prevent them from being confounded in whirlpools of
disturbance and disorder, it has seemed the safe course to keep what has been defined
aforetime fixed and unchanged, and to separate the above-named from our communion.
Wherefore we have sent envoys to your clemency to signify and explain the mind of the
synod as expressed in this letter. These envoys before all things we have charged to guard
the truth in accordance with the old and right definitions. They are to inform your holiness,
not as did Ursacius and Valens, that there will be peace if the truth be upset; for how can
the destroyers of peace be agents of peace? but rather that these changes will bring strife
and disturbance, as well on the rest of the cities, as on the Roman church. Wherefore we
beseech your clemency to receive our envoys with kindly ears and gentle mien, and not to
suffer any new thing to flout the dead. Suffer us to abide in the definition and settlement of
our Fathers, whom we would unhesitatingly declare to have done all they did with intelligence
and wisdom, and with the Holy Ghost. The innovation now sought to be introduced is filling
the faithful with unbelief, and unbelievers with credulity553.</p>

<p>The letter was written, and the envoys sent, but the high officers of the Imperial Court,
though they took the despatch and delivered it to their master, refused to introduce the envoys,
on the ground that the sovereign was occupied with state affairs. They took this course
in the hope that the bishops, annoyed at delay, and eager to return to the cities entrusted to
their care, would at length be compelled themselves to break up and disperse the bulwark
erected against heresy. But their ingenuity was frustrated, for the noble champions of the
Faith despatched a second letter to the emperor, exhorting him to admit the envoys to
audience and dissolve the synod. This letter I subjoin.</p>
<p>The Second Letter of the Synod to Constantius.</p>

send greeting.</p>

us that, in consequence of occupations of state, you have hitherto been unable to see
our envoys. You bid us await their return, that your piety may come to a decision on the
object we have in view, and on the decrees of our predecessors. But we venture in this letter
to repeat to your clemency the point which we urged before, for we have in no way withdrawn
from our position. We entreat you to receive with benign countenance the letter of our humility,
wherein now we make answer to your piety, and the points which we have ordered
to be submitted to your benignity by our envoys. Your clemency is no less aware than we
are ourselves how serious and unfitting a state of things it is, that in the time of your most
happy reign so many churches should seem to be without bishops. Wherefore once again,
most glorious autocrat, we beseech you that, if it be pleasing to your humanity, you will
command us to return to our churches before the rigour of winter, that we may be able,
with our people, as we have done and ever do, to offer most earnest prayers for the health

drawn up there.</head>
<p>After this letter they555 irritated the emperor, and got the majority of the bishops, against
their will, to a certain town of Thrace, of the name of Nica. Some simple men they deluded,
and others they terrified, into carrying out their old contrivance for injuring the true religion,
by erasing the words “Substance” and “of one Substance” from the Creed, and inserting instead
of them the word “like.” I insert their formula in this history, not as being couched in
proper terms, but because it convicts the faction of Arius, for it is not even accepted by the
disaffected of the present time. Now, instead of “the like” they preach “the unlike556.”</p>

Only-begotten Son of God, sent by His Father, we know to have come down from heaven,

Virgin Mary, as it is written, according to the flesh. Who companied with His disciples, and

buried, and descended to the world below, at Whom Hell himself trembled. On the third

was introduced by Acacius with the express purpose of deceiving or baffling the semi-Arian members of his
party. This measure was the more necessary for Eusebian interests, inasmuch as a new variety of the heresy arose
in the East at the same time, advocated by Aetius and Eunomius; who, by professing boldly the pure Arian text,
alarmed Constantius, and threw him back upon Basil, and the other semi-Arians. This new doctrine, called
Anomoean, because it maintained that the usia or substance of the Son was unlike (ἀνόμοιος) the Divine usia,
was actually adopted by one portion of the Eusebians, Valens, and his rude occidentals; whose language and
temper, not admitting the refinements of Grecian genius, led them to rush from orthodoxy into the most hard
and undisguised impiety. And thus the parties stand at the date now before us (a.d. 356–361); Constantius being
alternately swayed by Basil, Acacius, and Valens, that is by the Homousian, the Homoean, and the Anomoean,

and Lord, promised to send to man, the Comforter, as it is written, the Spirit of Truth. This
Spirit He Himself sent after He had ascended into Heaven and sat at the right hand of the
Father, from thence to come to judge both quick and dead. But the word ‘the Substance,’
which was too simply inserted by the Fathers, and, not being understood by the people, was
a cause of scandal through its not being found in the Scriptures, it hath seemed good to us
to remove, and that for the future no mention whatever be permitted of ‘Substance,’ on account
of the sacred Scriptures nowhere making any mention of the ‘Substance’ of the Father
and the Son. Nor must one ‘essence557’ be named in relation to the person558 of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. And we call the Son like the Father, as the Holy Scriptures call Him
and teach; but all the heresies, both those already condemned, and any, if such there be,
which have risen against the document thus put forth, let them be Anathema.”</p>

about the Council at Ariminum.</head>
<p>The condemnation of this formula by all the champions of the truth, and specially those
of the West, is shewn by the letter which they wrote to the Illyrians559. First of the signatories
was Damasus, who obtained the presidency of the church of Rome after Liberius, and was
adorned with many virtues560. With him signed ninety bishops of Italy and Galatia561, now
called Gaul, who met together at Rome. I would have inserted their names but that I thought
it superfluous.</p>

rest, to their beloved brethren the bishops of Illyria, send greeting in God.</p>
<p>“We believe that we, priests of God, by whom it is right for the rest to be instructed, are
holding and teaching our people the Holy Creed which was founded on the teaching of the
Apostles, and in no way departs from the definitions of the Fathers. But through a report
of the brethren in Gaul and Venetia we have learnt that certain men are fallen into heresy.</p>

<p>“It is the duty of the bishops not only to take precautions against this mischief, but also
to make a stand against whatever divergent teaching has arisen, either from incomplete instruction,
or the simplicity of readers of unsound commentators. They should be minded
not to slide into slippery paths, but rather whensoever divergent counsels are carried to
their ears, to hold fast the doctrine of our fathers. It has, therefore, been decided that Auxentius
of Milan is in this matter specially condemned. So it is right that all the teachers of
the law in the Roman Empire should be well instructed in the law, and not befoul the faith
with divergent doctrines.</p>
<p>“When first the wickedness of the heretics began to flourish, and when, as now, the
blasphemy of the Arians was crawling to the front, our fathers, three hundred and eighteen
bishops, the holiest prelates in the Roman Empire, deliberated at Nicæa. The wall which
they set up against the weapons of the devil, and the antidote wherewith they repelled his
deadly poisons, was their confession that the Father and the Son are of one substance, one
godhead, one virtue, one power, one likeness563, and that the Holy Ghost is of the same essence564
and substance. Whoever did not thus think was judged separate from our communion.
Their deliberation was worthy of all respect, and their definition sound. But certain
men have intended by other later discussions to corrupt and befoul it. Yet, at the very outset,
error was so far set right by the bishops on whom the attempt was made at Ariminum to
compel them to manipulate or innovate on the faith, that they confessed themselves seduced
by opposite arguments, or owned that they had not perceived any contradiction to the
opinion of the Fathers delivered at Nicæa. No prejudice could arise from the number of
bishops gathered at Ariminum, since it is well known that neither the bishop of the Romans,
whose opinion ought before all others to have been waited for, nor Vincentius, whose
stainless episcopate had lasted so many years, nor the rest, gave in their adhesion to such
doctrines. And this is the more significant, since, as has been already said, the very men who
seemed to be tricked into surrender, themselves, in their wiser moments, testified their
disapproval.</p>
<p>“Your sincerity then perceives that this one faith, which was founded at Nicæa on the
authority of the Apostles, ought to be kept secure for ever. You perceive that with us, the
bishops of the East, who confess themselves Catholic, and the western bishops, together
glory in it. We believe that before long those who think otherwise ought without delay to
be put out from our communion, and deprived of the name of bishop, that their flocks may
be freed from error and breathe freely. For they cannot be expected to correct the errors of

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Letter of Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, concerning the same
Council.</head>
<p>The great Athanasius also, in his letter to the Africans, writes thus about the council at
Ariminum. “Under these circumstances who will tolerate any mention of the council of
Ariminum or any other beside the Nicene? Who would not express detestation of the setting
aside of the words of the Fathers, and the preference for those introduced at Ariminum by
violence and party strife? Who would wish to be associated with these men—fellows who
do not, forsooth, accept their own words? In their own ten or a dozen synods they have laid
down, as has been narrated already, now one thing now another; and at the present time
these synods, one after another, they are themselves openly denouncing. They are now suffering
the fate undergone of old by the traitors of the Jews. For as is written in the Book of
the Prophet Jeremiah “they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them
out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water,”565 so these men, in their opposition to
the OEcumenical synod, have hewed for themselves many synods which have all proved vain
and like “buds that yield no meal,”566 let us not therefore admit those who cite the council
of Ariminum or any other but that of Nicæa, for indeed the very citers of Ariminum do not
seem to know what was done there; if they had they would have held their tongues. For you,
beloved, have learnt from your own representatives at that Council, and are consequently
very well aware, that Ursacius, Valens, Eudoxius, and Auxentius, and with them Demophilus
were asked to anathematize the Arian heresy, and made excuse, choosing rather to be its
champions, and so were all deposed for making propositions contrary to the Nicene decrees.
The bishops, on the contrary, who were the true servants of the Lord, and of the right
faith,—about two hundred in number,—declared their adherence to the Nicene Council
alone, and their refusal to entertain the thought of either subtraction from, or addition to,
its decrees. This conclusion they have communicated to Constantius, by whose order the
council assembled.</p>
<p>On the other hand the bishops who were deposed at Ariminum have been received by
Constantius, and have succeeded in getting the two hundred who sentenced them grossly
insulted, and threatened with not being allowed to return to their dioceses, and with having
to undergo rigorous treatment in Thrace, and that in the winter, in order to force them to
accept the innovators’ measures.</p>
<p>If, then, we hear any one appealing to Ariminum, show us, let us rejoin, first the sentence
of deposition, and then the document drawn up by the bishops, in which they declare that
they do not seek to go beyond the terms drawn up by the Nicene Fathers, nor appeal to any
other council than that of Nicæa. In reality, these are just the facts they conceal, while they

put prominently forward the forced confession of Thrace. They do but shew themselves
friends of the Arian heresy, and strangers to the sound faith. Only let any one be willing to
put side by side that great synod, and those others to which these men appeal, and he will
perceive, on the one side, true religion, on the other, folly and disorder. The fathers of Nicæa
met together not after being deposed, but after confessing that the Son was of the Substance
of the Father. These men were deposed once, a second time, and again a third time at Ariminum,
and then dared to lay down that it is wrong to attribute Substance or Essence to
God. So strange and so many were the tricks and machinations concocted by the mad gang
of Arius in the West against the dogmas of the Truth.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Concerning the cunning of Leontius, Bishop of Antioch, and the boldness of
Flavianus and Diodorus.</head>
<p>At Antioch Placidus was succeeded by Stephanus, who was expelled from the Church.
Leontius then accepted the Primacy, but in violation of the decrees of the Nicene Council,
for he had mutilated himself, and was an eunuch. The cause of his rash deed is thus narrated
by the blessed Athanasius. Leontius, it seems, was the victim of slanderous statements on
account of a certain young woman of the name of Eustolia.567 Finding himself prevented
from dwelling with her he mutilated himself for her sake, in order that he might feel free to
live with her. But he did not clear himself of suspicion, and all the more for this reason was
deposed from the presbyterate. So much Athanasius has written about the rest of his earlier
life. I shall now give a summary exposure of his evil conduct. Now though he shared the
Arian error, he always endeavoured to conceal his unsoundness. He observed that the clergy
and the rest of the people were divided into two parts, the one, in giving glory to the Son,
using the conjunction “and,” the other using the preposition “through” of the Son, and applying
“in” to the Holy Ghost. He himself offered all the doxology in silence, and all that
those standing near him could hear was the “For ever and ever.” And had not the exceeding
wickedness of his soul been betrayed by other means, it might have been said that he adopted
this contrivance from a wish to promote concord among the people. But when he had
wrought much mischief to the champions of the truth, and continued to give every support
to the promoters of impiety, he was convicted of concealing his own unsoundness. He was
influenced both by his fear of the people, and by the grievous threats which Constantius
had uttered against any who had dared to say that the Son was unlike the Father. His real
sentiments were however proved by his conduct. Followers of the Apostolic doctrines never
received from him either ordination or indeed the least encouragement. Men, on the other
hand, who sided with the Arian superstition, were both allowed perfect liberty in expressing
their opinions, and were from time to time admitted to priestly office. At this juncture Aetius,
the master of Eunomius, who promoted the Arian error by his speculations, was admitted
to the diaconate. Flavianus and Diodorus, however, who had embraced an ascetic career,
and were open champions of the Apostolic decrees, publicly protested against the attacks
of Leontius against true religion. That a man nurtured in iniquity and scheming to win notoriety
by ungodliness should be counted worthy of the diaconate, was, they urged, a disgrace
to the Church. They further threatened that they would withdraw from his communion,

Nicene Council περὶ τῶν τολμώντων ἑαυτοὺς ἐκτέμνειν Theodoretus (iv. 12) relates an instance of what was considered
conjugal chastity, and the mischiefs referred to in the text arose from the rash attempt to imitate such continence.

and suspended Aetius from his sacred office, but continued to show him marked favour.</p>
<p>That excellent pair Flavianus and Diodorus,568 though not yet admitted to the priesthood
and still ranked with the laity, worked night and day to stimulate men’s zeal for truth. They
were the first to divide choirs into two parts, and to teach them to sing the psalms of David
antiphonally. Introduced first at Antioch, the practice spread in all directions, and penetrated
to the ends of the earth. Its originators now collected the lovers of the Divine word and work
into the Churches of the Martyrs, and with them spent the night in singing psalms to God.</p>
<p>When Leontius perceived this, he did not think it safe to try to prevent them, for he saw
that the people were exceedingly well-disposed towards these excellent men. However,
putting a colour of courtesy on his speech, he requested that they would perform this act of
worship in the churches. They were perfectly well aware of his evil intent. Nevertheless they
set about obeying his behest and readily summoned their choir569 to the Church, exhorting
them to sing praises to the good Lord. Nothing, however, could induce Leontius to correct
<note type="footnote">568 Flavianus was a noble native of Antioch, and was afterwards (381–404) bishop of that see. Diodorus in
later times (c. 379) became bishop of Tarsus, “one of the most deservedly venerated names in the Eastern church
for learning, sanctity, courage in withstanding heresy, and zeal in the defence of the truth. Diodorus has a still
greater claim on the grateful remembrances of the whole church, as, if not the founder, the chief promoter of
the rational school of scriptural interpretation, of which his disciples, Chrysostom and Theodorus of Mopsuestia,
and Theodoret, were such distinguished representatives.” Dict. Christ. Biog. i. 836. On the renewed championship
of the Antiochene church by Flavianus and Diodorus under the persecution of Valens vide iv. 22. Socrates (vi.
8), describing the rivalry of the Homoousians and Arians in singing partizan hymns antiphonally in the streets
of Antioch in the days of Arcadius, traces the mode of chanting to the great Ignatius, who once in a Vision heard
angels so praising God. But, remarks Bp. Lightfoot (Apostolic Fathers Pt. 2. I. p. 31.) “Antiphonal singing did
not need to be suggested by a heavenly Vision. It existed already among the heathen in the arrangements of the
Greek Chorus. It was practised with much elaboration of detail in the Psalmody of the Jews, as appears from
the account which is given of the Egyptian Therapeutes. Its introduction into the Christian Church therefore
was a matter of course almost from the beginning: and when we read in Pliny (Ep. x. 97) that the Christians of
Bithynia sang hymns to Christ as to a god, ‘alternately’ (secum invicem) we may reasonably infer that the practice
of antiphonal singing prevailed far beyond the limits of the church of Antioch, even in the time of Ignatius
himself.” Augustine (Conf. ix. 7) states that the fashion of singing “secundum morem orientalium partium” was
introduced into the Church of Milan at the time of the persecution of Ambrose by Justina, “ne populus
moeroris toedio contabesceret,” and thence spread all over the globe. Platina attributes the introduction of antiphons
at Rome to Pope Damasus. Hooker (ii. 166) quotes the older authority of “the Prophet Esay,” in the vision
where the seraphim cried to one another in what Bp. Mant calls “the alternate hymn.”</note>

his wickedness, but he put on the mask of equity,570 and concealed the iniquity of Stephanus
and Placidus. Men who had accepted the corruption of the faith of priests and deacons, although
they had embraced a life of vile irregularity, he added to the roll; while others adorned
with every kind of virtue and firm adherents of apostolic doctrines, he left unrecognised.
Thus it came to pass that among the clergy were numbered a majority of men tainted with
heresy, while the mass of the laity were champions of the Faith, and even professional
teachers lacked courage to lay bare their blasphemy. In truth the deeds of impiety and
iniquity done by Placidus, Stephanus, and Leontius, in Antioch are so many as to want a
special history of their own, and so terrible as to be worthy of the lament of David; for of
them too it must be said “For lo thy enemies make a murmuring and they that hate thee lift
up their head. They have imagined craftily against the people and taken counsel against thy
secret ones. They have said come and let us root them out that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.”571</p>

Basilius573 of Ancyra, and of Eustathius574 of Sebasteia against him.</head>
<p>Germanicia is a city on the coasts of Cilicia, Syria, and Cappadocia, and belongs to the
province called Euphratisia. Eudoxius, the head of its church, directly he heard of the death
of Leontius, betook himself to Antioch and clutched the see, where he ravaged the vineyard
of the Lord like a wild boar. He did not even attempt to hide his evil ways, like Leontius,
but raged in direct attack upon the apostolic decrees, and involved in various troubles all
who had the hardihood to gainsay him. Now at this time Basilius had succeeded Marcellus,
and held the helm of the church of Ancyra, the capital of Galatia, and Sebastia, the chief city
of Armenia, was under the guidance of Eustathius. No sooner had these bishops heard of
the iniquity and madness of Eudoxius, than they wrote to inform the Emperor Constantius
of his audacity. Constantius was now still tarrying in the west, and, after the death of the
tyrants, was endeavouring to heal the harm they had caused. Both bishops were well known
to the Emperor and had great influence with him on account of the high character they
bore.</p>
<note type="footnote">572 Eudoxius, eighth bishop of Constantinople, and formerly of Germanicia (Γερμανικεια, now Marash, or
Banicia), was one of the most violent of the Arians. He was originally refused ordination by St. Eustathius, but
on the deposition of that bishop in 331 the Eusebians pushed him forward. After ruling at Germanicia for some
seventeen years he intruded himself on the see of Antioch. Under the patronage of the Acacians he became patriarch
of Constantinople in 360, and died in 370.</note>
<note type="footnote">573 Basilius, a learned physician, a Semiarian of Ancyra, was made bishop of that see on the deposition of
Marcellus, in 336, and excommunicated at Sardica in 347. In 350 he was reinstated at the command of Constantius.
He was again exiled under Acacian influence, failed to get restitution from Jovian, and probably died in
exile. (Soc. ii, 20, 26, iv, 24.) Vide also Theod. ii, 23. His works are lost. Athanasius praises him as among those
who were (de Synod. 603 ed. Migne) “not far from accepting the Homousion.”</note>
<note type="footnote">574 Eustathius was bishop of Sebasteia or Sebaste (Siwas) on the Halys, from 357 to 380. Basil, Ep. 244, §9, says
that he was a heretic “black who could not turn white”; but he exhibited many shades of theological colour, preserving
through all vicissitudes a high personal character, and a something “more than human.” Basil Ep. 212, §2. Ordained by
Eulalius, he was degraded because he insisted on wearing very unclerical costume. (Soc. ii, 43.) The question of the

had committed the see of Antioch to Eudoxius, as Eudoxius had publicly announced. He
ordered that Eudoxius be banished, and be punished for the course he had taken at the
Bithynian Nicæa, where he had ordered the synod to assemble. Eudoxius himself had persuaded
the officers entrusted with authority in the imperial household to fix Nicæa for the
Council. But the Supreme Ruler and Governor, who knows the future like the past, stopped
the assembly by a mighty earthquake, whereby the greater part of the city was overthrown,
and most of the inhabitants destroyed. On learning this the assembled bishops were seized
with panic, and returned to their own churches. But I regard this as a contrivance of the
divine wisdom, for in that city the doctrine of the faith of the apostles had been defined by
the holy Fathers. In that same city the bishops who were assembling on this later occasion
were intending to lay down the contrary. The sameness of name would have been sure to
furnish a means of deception to the Arian crew, and trick unsophisticated souls. They meant
to call the council “the Nicene,” and identify it with the famous council of old. But He who

of the district. Hither the bishops of the East, and with them those of Pontus in Asia, were
ordered to assemble.575</p>
<p>The see of Cæsarea, the capital of Palestine, was now held by Acacius, who had succeeded

it was divided. The Westerns were to meet at Ariminum in Italy, the Easterns at Seleucia in Isauria.”
“It was a fairly central spot, and easy of access from Egypt and Syria by sea, but otherwise most unsuitable. It
was a mere fortress, lying in a rugged country, where the spurs of Mount Taurus reach the sea. Around it were
the ever-restless marauders of Isauria.” “The choice of such a place is as significant as if a Pan-Anglican synod
were called to meet at the central and convenient port of Souakim.” Gwatkin “The Arian Controversy.” pp.
93–96. The Council met here a.d. 359.</note>
<note type="footnote">576 He appears to have been less conspicuous for consistency in the Arian Controversy. At Tyre he is described
by Sozomen and Socrates as assenting to the deposition of Athanasius but Rufinus (H. E. i. 17) tells the dramatic
story of the successful interposition of the aged and mutilated Paphnutius of the Thebaid, who took his vacillating
brother by the hand, and led him to the little knot of Athanasians. Sozomen (iv. 203) represents him as deposed
by Acacius for too zealous orthodoxy, and replaced by Cyril, then a Semiarian. Jerome agrees with Theodoret,
and makes Cyril succeed on the death of Maximus in 350 or 351. (Chron. ann. 349.)</note>

precedence of the sees of Cæsarea and Ælia (Jerusalem), and in 357 deposed. On appeal to the Council of
Seleucia he was reinstated, but again deposed by Constantius, partly on the pretended charge of dealing improperly
with a robe given by Constantine to Macarius, which Theodoret records later (Chap. xiii.) Restored by Julian

tions with one another for the first place brought great calamities on the state. Acacius seized
some small occasion, deposed Cyrillus, and drove him from Jerusalem. But Cyrillus passed
by Antioch, which he had found without a pastor, and came to Tarsus, where he dwelt with
the excellent Silvanus, then bishop of that see. No sooner did Acacius become aware of this
than he wrote to Silvanus and informed him of the deposition of Cyrillus. Silvanus however,
both out of regard for Cyrillus, and not without suspicion of his people, who greatly enjoyed
the stranger’s teaching, refused to prohibit him from taking a part in the ministrations of
the church. When however they had arrived at Seleucia, Cyrillus joined with the party of
Basilius and Eustathius and Silvanus and the rest in the council. But when Acacius joined
the assembled bishops, who numbered one hundred and fifty, he refused to be associated
in their counsels before Cyrillus, as one stripped of his bishopric, had been put out from
among them. There were some who, eager for peace, besought Cyrillus to withdraw, with
a pledge that after the decision of the decrees they would enquire into his case. He would
not give way, and Acacius left them and went out. Then meeting Eudoxius he removed his
alarm, and encouraged him with a promise that he would stand his friend and supporter.
Thus he hindered him from taking part in the council, and set out with him for Constantinople.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Of what befell the orthodox bishops at Constantinople.</head>
<p>Constantius, on his return from the West, passed some time at Constantinople. There
Acacius urged many accusations against the assembled bishops in presence of the emperor,
called them a set of vile characters convoked for the ruin and destruction of the churches,
and so fired the imperial wrath. And not least was Constantius moved by what was alleged
against Cyrillus, “for,” said Acachius, “the holy robe, which the illustrious Constantine the
emperor, in his desire to honour the church of Jerusalem, gave to Macarius, the bishop of
that city, to be worn when he performed the rite of divine baptism, all fashioned with golden
threads as it was, has been sold by Cyrillus. It has been bought,” he continued, “by a certain
stage dancer; dancing about when he was wearing it, he fell down and perished. With a man
like this Cyrillus,” he went on, “they set themselves up to judge and decide for the rest of
the world.” The influential party at the court made this an occasion for persuading the emperor
not to summon the whole synod, for they were alarmed at the concord of the majority,
but only ten leading men. Of these were Eustathius of Armenia, Basilius of Galatia, Silvanus
of Tarsus, and Eleusius of Cyzicus.578</p>
<p>On their arrival they urged the emperor that Eudoxius should be convicted of blasphemy
and lawlessness. Constantius, however, schooled by the opposite party, replied that a decision
must first be come to on matters concerning the faith, and that afterwards the case of Eudoxius
should be enquired into. Basilius, relying on his former intimacy, ventured boldly
to object to the emperor that he was attacking the apostolic decrees; but Constantius took
this ill, and told Basilius to hold his tongue, “for to you,” said he, “the disturbance of the
churches is due.” When Basilius was silenced, Eustathius intervened and said, “since, sir,
you wish a decision to be come to on what concerns the faith, consider the blasphemies
rashly uttered against the Only Begotten by Eudoxius,” and as he spoke he produced the
exposition of faith wherein, besides many other impieties, were found the following expressions:
“Things that are spoken of in unlike terms are unlike in substance:” “There is one
God the Father of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all
things.” Now the term “of whom” is unlike the term “through whom;” so the Son is unlike
God the Father. Constantius ordered this exposition of the faith to be read, and was displeased
with the blasphemy which it involved. He therefore asked Eudoxius if he had drawn it up.
<note type="footnote">578 i.e., Eustathius of Sebasteia, and Basilius of Ancyra (vide note on p. 86). Silvanus of Tarsus was one of the
Semiarians of high character. For his kindly entertainment of Cyril of Jerusalem vide page 87. Tillemont places
his death in 363. Eleusius of Cyzicus was also a Semiarian of the better type (cf. Hil. de Syn. p. 133). The evil genius of
his life was Macedorius of Constantinople, by whose influence he was made bishop of Cyzicus in 356. Here with equal
zeal he destroyed pagan temples and a Novatian church, and this was remembered against him when he attempted to
return to his see on the accession of Julian. At Nicomedia in 366 he was moved by the threats of Valens to declare himself
an Arian and then in remorse resigned his see, but his flock refused to let him go, Socr. iv. 6.</note>

<pb n="199"/>
Eudoxius instantly repudiated the authorship, and said that it was written by Aetius. Now
Aetius was he whom Leontius, in dread of the accusations of Flavianus and Diodorus, had
formerly degraded from the diaconate. He had also been the supporter of Georgius, the
treacherous foe of the Alexandrians, alike in his impious words and his unholy deeds. At
the present time he was associated with Eunomius and Eudoxius; for, on the death of Leontius,
when Eudoxius had laid violent hands on the episcopal throne of the church at Antioch,
he returned from Egypt with Eunomius, and, as he found Eudoxius to be of the same way
of thinking as himself, a sybarite in luxury as well as a heretic in faith, he chose Antioch as
the most congenial place of abode, and both he and Eunomius were fast fixtures at the
couches of Eudoxius. His highest ambition was to be a successful parasite, and he spent his
whole time in going to gorge himself at one man’s table or another’s. The emperor had been
told all this, and now ordered Aetius to be brought before him. On his appearance Constantius
showed him the document in question and proceeded to enquire if he was the author
of its language. Aetius, totally ignorant of what had taken place, and unaware of the drift of
the enquiry, expected that he should win praise by confession, and owned that he was the
author of the phrases in question. Then the emperor perceived the greatness of his iniquity,
and forthwith condemned him to exile and to be deported to a place in Phrygia. So Aetius
reaped disgrace as the fruit of blasphemy, and was cast out of the palace. Eustathius then
alleged that Eudoxius too held the same views, for that Aetius had shared his roof and his
table, and had drawn up this blasphemous formula in submission to his judgement. In proof
of his contention that Eudoxius was concerned in drawing up the document he urged the
fact that no one had attributed it to Aetius except Eudoxius himself. To this the emperor
enjoined that judges must not decide on conjecture, but are bound to make exact examination
of the facts. Eustathius assented, and urged that Eudoxius should give proof of his dissent
from the sentiments attributed to him by anathematizing the composition of Aetius. This
suggestion the emperor very readily accepted, and gave his orders accordingly; but Eudoxius
drew back, and employed many shifts to evade compliance. But when the emperor waxed
wroth and threatened to send him off to share the exile of Aetius, on the ground that he was
a partner in the blasphemy so punished, he repudiated his own doctrine, though both then
and afterwards he persistently maintained it. However, he in his turn protested against the
Eustathians that it was their duty to condemn the word “Homoüsion” as unscriptural.</p>
<p>Silvanus on the contrary pointed out that it was their duty to reject and expel from their
holy assemblies the phrases “out of the non-existent” and “creature” and “of another substance,”
these terms being also unscriptural and found in the writings of neither prophets
nor apostles. Constantius decided that this was right, and bade the Arians pronounce the
condemnation. At first they persisted in refusing; but in the end, when they saw the emperor’s
wrath, they consented, though much against the grain, to condemn the terms Silvanus had
put before them. But all the more earnestly they insisted on their demand for the condem-

<pb n="200"/>
nation of the “Homoüsion.” But then with unanswerable logic Silvanus put both before the
Arians and the emperor the truth that if God the Word is not of the non-Existent, He is not
a Creature, and is not of another Substance. He is then of one Substance with God Who
begat Him, as God of God and Light of Light, and has the same nature as the Begetter. This
contention he urged with power and with truth, but not one of his hearers was convinced.
The party of Acacius and Eudoxius raised a mighty uproar; the emperor was angered, and
threatened expulsion from their churches. Thereupon Eleusius and Silvanus and the rest
said that while authority to punish lay with the emperor, it was their province to decide on
points of piety or impiety, and “we will not,” they protested, “betray the doctrine of the
Fathers.”</p>
<p>Constantius ought to have admired both their wisdom and their courage, and their bold
defence of the apostolic decrees, but he exiled them from their churches, and ordered others
to be appointed in their place. Thereupon Eudoxius laid violent hands on the Church of
Constantinople; and on the expulsion of Eleusius from Cyzicus, Eunomius was appointed
in his place.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Synodical Epistle written against Aetius.</head>
<p>After these transactions the emperor ordered Aetius to be condemned by a formal Letter,
and, in obedience to the command, his companions in iniquity condemned their own associate.
Accordingly they wrote to Georgius, bishop of Alexandria, the letter about him to
which I shall give a place in my history, in order to expose their wickedness, for they treated
their friends and their foes precisely in the same way.</p>
<p>Copy of the Letter written by the whole council to Georgius against Aetius his deacon,
on account of his iniquitous blasphemy.</p>
<p>To the right honourable Lord Georgius, Bishop of Alexandria, the holy Synod in Constantinople
assembled, Greeting.</p>
<p>In consequence of the condemnation of Aetius by the Synod, on account of his unlawful
and most offensive writings, he has been dealt with by the bishops in accordance with the
canons of the church. He has been degraded from the diaconate and expelled from the
Church, and our admonitions have gone forth that none are to read his unlawful epistles,
but that on account of their unprofitable and worthless character they are to be cast aside.
We have further appended an anathema on him, if he abides in his opinion, and on his
supporters.</p>
<p>It would naturally have followed that all the bishops met together in the Synod should
have felt detestation of, and approved the sentence delivered against, a man who is the author
of offences, disturbances and schisms, of agitation over all the world, and of rising of church
against church. But in spite of our prayers, and against all our expectation, Seras, Stephanus,
Heliodorus and Theophilus and their party579 have not voted with us, and have not even
consented to subscribe the sentence delivered against him, although Seras charged the
aforenamed Aetius with another instance of insane arrogance, alleging that he, with still
bolder impudence, had sprung forward to declare that what God had concealed from the
Apostles had been now revealed to him. Even after these wild and boastful words, reported
by Seras about Aetius, the aforenamed bishops were not put out of countenance, nor could

they be induced to vote with us on his condemnation. We however with much long suffering
bore with them580 for a great length of time, now indignant, now beseeching, now importuning
them to join with us and make the decision of the Synod unanimous; and we persevered
long in the hope that they might hear and agree and give in. But when in spite of
all this patience we could not shame them into acceptance of our declarations against the
aforesaid offender, we counted the rule of the church more precious than the friendship of
men, and pronounced against them a decree of excommunication, allowing them a period
of six mouths for conversion, repentance, and the expression of a desire for union and harmony
with the synod. If within the given time they should turn and accept agreement with
their brethren and assent to the decrees about Aetius, we decided that they should be received
into the church, to the recovery of their own authority in synods, and our affection. If
however they obstinately persisted, and preferred human friendship to the canons of the
church and our affection, then we judged them deposed from the rank of the bishops. If
they suffer degradation it is necessary to appoint other bishops in their place, that the lawful
church may be duly ordered and at unity with herself, while all the bishops of every nation
by uttering the same doctrine with one mind and one counsel preserve the bond of love.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Of the causes which separated the Eunomians from the Arians.</head>
<p>Eunomius in his writings praises Aetius, styles him a man of God, and honours him
with many compliments. Yet he was at that time closely associated with the party by whom
Aetius had been repudiated, and to them he owed his election to his bishopric.</p>
<p>Now the followers of Eudoxius and Acacius, who had assented to the decrees put forth
at Nice in Thrace, already mentioned in this history, appointed other bishops in the churches
of the adherents of Basilius and Eleusius in their stead. On other points I think it superfluous
to write in detail. I purpose only to relate what concerns Eunomius.</p>
<p>For when Eunomius had seized on the see of Cyzicus in the lifetime of Eleusius, Eudoxius
urged him to hide his opinions and not make them known to the party who were seeking
a pretext to persecute him. Eudoxius was moved to offer this advice both by his knowledge
that the diocese was sound in the faith and his experience of the anger manifested by Constantius
against the party who asserted the only begotten Son of God to be a created being.
“Let us” said he to Eunomius “bide our time; when it comes we will preach what now we
are keeping dark; educate the ignorant; and win over or compel or punish our opponents.”
Eunomius, yielding to these suggestions, propounded his impious doctrine under the
shadow of obscurity. Those of his hearers who had been nurtured on the divine oracles saw
clearly that his utterances concealed under their surface a foul fester of error.581</p>
<p>But however distressed they were they considered it less the part of prudence than of
rashness to make any open protest, so they assumed a mask of heretical heterodoxy, and
paid a visit to the bishop at his private residence with the earnest request that he would have
regard to the distress of men borne hither and thither by different doctrines, and would
plainly expound the truth. Eunomius thus emboldened declared the sentiments which he
secretly held. The deputation then went on to remark that it was unfair and indeed quite
wrong for the whole of his diocese to be prevented from having their share of the truth. By
these and similar arguments he was induced to lay bare his blasphemy in the public assemblies
of the church. Then his opponents hurried with angry fervour to Constantinople; first they
indicted him before Eudoxius, and when Eudoxius refused to see them, sought an audience
of the emperor and made lamentation over the ruin their bishop was wreaking among them.
“The sermons of Eunomius,” they said, “are more impious than the blasphemies of Arius.”
The wrath of Constantius was roused, and he commanded Eudoxius to send for Eunomius,
and, on his conviction, to strip him of his bishopric. Eudoxius, of course, though again and
again importuned by the accusers, continued to delay taking action. Then once more they
approached the emperor with vociferous complaints that Eudoxius had not obeyed the im-

ills below.”</note>

<pb n="204"/>
perial commands in any single particular, and was perfectly indifferent to the delivery of an
important city to the blasphemies of Eunomius. Then said Constantius to Eudoxius, if you
do not fetch Eunomius and try him, and on conviction of the charges brought against him,
punish him, I shall exile you. This threat frightened Eudoxius, so he wrote to Eunomius to
escape from Cyzicus, and told him he had only himself to blame because he had not followed
the hints given him. Eunomius accordingly withdrew in alarm, but he could not endure the
disgrace, and endeavoured to fix the guilt of his betrayal on Eudoxius, maintaining that
both he and Aetius had been cruelly treated. And from that time he set up a sect of his own
for all the men who were of his way of thinking and condemned his betrayal, separated from
Eudoxius and joined with Eunomius, whose name they bear up to this day. So Eunomius
became the founder of a heresy, and added to the blasphemy of Arius by his own peculiar
guilt. He set up a sect of his own because he was a slave to his ambition, as the facts distinctly
prove. For when Aetius was condemned and exiled, Eunomius refused to accompany him,
though he called him his master and a man of God, but remained closely associated with
Eudoxius.</p>
<p>But when his turn came he paid the penalty of his iniquity; he did not submit to the
vote of the synod, but began to ordain bishops and presbyters, though himself deprived of
his episcopal rank. These then were the deeds done at Constantinople.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Of the siege of the city of Nisibis,582and the apostolic conversation of Bishop
Jacobus.</head>
<p>On war being waged against the Romans by Sapor King of Persia, Constantius mustered
his forces and marched to Antioch. But the enemy were driven forth, not by the Roman
army, but by Him whom the pious in the Roman host worshipped as their God. How the
victory was won I shall now proceed to relate.</p>
<p>Nisibis, sometimes called Antiochia Mygdonia, lies on the confines of the realms of
Persia and of Rome. In Nisibis Jacobus whom I named just now was at once bishop,
guardian,583 and commander in chief. He was a man who shone with the grace of a truly
apostolic character. His extraordinary and memorable miracles, which I have fully related
in my religious history, I think it superfluous and irrelevant to enumerate again.584</p>
<note type="footnote">582 Now Nisibin, an important city of Mesopotamia on the Mygdonius (Hulai). Its name was changed under
the Macedonian dynasty to Antiochia Mygdonica. Frequently taken and retaken it was ultimately ceded by
Jovian to Sapor a.d. 363.</note>
<note type="footnote">583 “πολιοῦχος” is an epithet of the protecting deity of a city, as of Athens “Παλλὰς πολιοῦχος;” Ar. Eq. 581.</note>
<note type="footnote">584 Born in the city of which he was afterwards bishop, Jacobus early acquired fame by his ascetic austerity.
While on a journey into Persia with the object at once of confirming his own faith and that of the Christian
sufferers under the persecution of Sapor II, he was supposed to work wonders, of which the following, related
by Theodoretus, is a specimen. Once upon a time he saw a Persian judge delivering an unjust sentence. Now a
huge stone happening to be lying close by, he ordered it to be crushed and broken into pieces, and so proved
the injustice of the sentence. The stone was instantly divided into innumerable fragments, the spectators were
panic-stricken, and the judge in terror revoked his sentence and delivered a righteous judgment. On the see of
his native city falling vacant Jacobus was made bishop. The “Religious History” describes him as signalling his
episcopate by the miracle attributed by Gregory of Nyssa to Gregory the Wonder-Worker, and by Sozomen (vii.
27) to Epiphanius. As in the “Nuremberg Chronicle,” the same woodcut serves for Thales, Nehemiah, and Dante,
so a popular miracle was indiscriminately assigned to saint after saint. “Once upon a time he came to a certain
village,—the spot I cannot name,—and up come some beggars putting down one of their number before him
as though dead, and begging him to supply some necessaries for the funeral. Jacobus granted their petition, and
on behalf of the apparently dead man began to pray to God to forgive him the sins of his lifetime and grant him
a place in the company of the just. Even while he was speaking, away flew the soul of the man who had up to
this moment shammed death, and coverings were provided for the corpse. The holy man proceeded on his
journey, and the inventors of this play told their recumbent companion to get up. But now they saw that he did
not hear, that the pretence had become a reality, and that what a moment ago was a live man’s mask was now
a dead man’s face. So they overtake the great Jacobus, bow down before him, roll at his feet and declare that
they would not have played their impudent trick but for their poverty, and implored him to forgive them and
restore the dead man’s soul. So Jacobus in imitation of the philanthropy of the Lord granted their prayer, exhibited
his wonder working power, and through his prayer restored the life which his power had taken away.” At Nicæa</note>

<pb n="206"/>
<p>One however I will record because of the subject before us. The city which Jacobus ruled
was now in possession of the Romans, and besieged by the Persian Army. The blockade was
prolonged for seventy days. “Helepoles”585 and many other engines were advanced to the
walls. The town was begirt with a palisade and entrenchment, but still held out. The river
Mygdonius flowing through the middle of the town, at last the Persians dammed its stream
a considerable distance up, and increased the height of its bank on both sides so as to shut
the waters in. When they saw that a great mass of water was collected and already beginning
to overflow the dam, they suddenly launched it like an engine against the wall. The impact
was tremendous; the bulwarks could not sustain it, but gave way and fell down. Just the
same fate befell the other side of the circuit, through which the Mygdonius made its exit; it
could not withstand the shock, and was carried away. No sooner did Sapor see this than he
expected to capture the rest of the city, and for all that day he rested for the mud to dry and
the river to become passable. Next day he attacked in full force, and looked to enter the city
through the breaches that had been made. But he found the wall built up on both sides, and
all his labour vain. For that holy man, through prayer, filled with valour both the troops
and the rest of the townsfolk, and both built the walls, withstood the engines, and beat off
the advancing foe. And all this he did without approaching the walls, but by beseeching the
Lord of all within the church. Sapor, moreover, was not only astounded at the speed of the
building of the walls but awed by another spectacle. For he saw standing on the battlements
one of kingly mien and all ablaze with purple robe and crown. He supposed that this was
the Roman emperor, and threatened his attendants with death for not having announced
the imperial presence; but on their stoutly maintaining that their report had been a true one
and that Constantius was at Antioch, he perceived the meaning of the vision and exclaimed
“their God is fighting for the Romans.” Then the wretched man in a rage flung a javelin into

Therefore the excellent Ephraim (he is the best writer among the Syrians) besought the divine

So the divine man consented and climbed up into a tower but when he saw the innumerable

upon them, so that by means of these tiny animals they might learn the might of the Protector

trunks of the elephants, and the ears and nostrils of horses and other animals. Finding the
attack of these little creatures past endurance they broke their bridles, unseated their riders
and threw the ranks into confusion. The Persians abandoned their camp and fled head-long.

<p>At this time,586 Constantius was residing at Antioch. The Persian war was over; there
had been a time of peace, and he once again gathered bishops together with the object of
making them all deny both the formula “of one substance” and also the formula “of different
substance.” On the death of Leontius, Eudoxius had seized the see of Antioch, but on his
expulsion and illegal establishment, after many synods, at Constantinople, the church of
Antioch had been left without a shepherd. Accordingly the assembled bishops, gathered in
considerable numbers from every quarter, asserted that their primary obligation was to
provide a pastor for the flock and that then with him they would deliberate on matters of
faith. It fell out opportunely that the divine Meletius who was ruling a certain city of Armenia587
had been grieved with the insubordination of the people under his rule and was
now living without occupation elsewhere. The Arian faction imagined that Meletius was of
the same way of thinking as themselves, and an upholder of their doctrines. They therefore
petitioned Constantius to commit to his hands the reins of the Antiochene church. Indeed
in the hope of establishing their impiety there was no law that they did not fearlessly transgress;
illegality was becoming the very foundation of their blasphemy; nor was this an isolated
specimen of their irregular proceedings. On the other hand the maintainers of apostolic
doctrine, who were perfectly well aware of the soundness of the great Meletius, and had
clear knowledge of his stainless character and wealth of virtue, came to a common vote, and
took measures to have their resolution written out and subscribed by all without delay. This
document both parties as a bond of compromise entrusted to the safe keeping of a bishop
who was a noble champion of the truth, Eusebius of Samosata. And when the great Meletius
had received the imperial summons and arrived, forth to meet him came all the higher ranks
of the priesthood, forth came all the other orders of the church, and the whole population
of the city. There, too, were Jews and Gentiles all eager to see the great Meletius. Now the
emperor had charged both Meletius and the rest who were able to speak to expound to the
multitude the text “The Lord formed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of
old” (Prov. viii. 22. lxx), and he ordered skilled writers to take down on the spot what each
man said, with the idea that in this manner their instruction would be more exact. First of
all Georgius of Laodicea gave vent to his foul heresy. After him Acacius588 of Cæsarea pro-

<pb n="209"/>
pounded a doctrine of compromise far removed indeed from the blasphemy of the enemy,
but not preserving the apostolic doctrine pure and undefiled. Then up rose the great Meletius
and exhibited the unbending line of the canon of the faith, for using the truth as a carpenter
does his rule he avoided excess and defect. Then the multitude broke into loud applause
and besought him to give them a short summary of his teaching. Accordingly after showing
three fingers, he withdrew two, left one, and uttered the memorable sentence, “In thought
they are three but we speak as to one.”589</p>
<p>Against this teaching the men who had the plague of Arius in their hearts whetted their
tongues, and started an ingenious slander, declaring that the divine Meletius was a Sabellian.
Thus they persuaded the fickle sovereign who, like the well known Euripus,590 easily shifted
his current now this way and now that, and induced him to relegate Meletius to his own
home.</p>
<p>Euzoius, an open defender of Arian tenets, was promptly promoted to his place; the
very man whom, then a deacon, the great Alexander had degraded at the same time as Arius.
Now the part of the people who remained sound separated from the unsound and assembled
in the apostolic church which is situated in the part of the city called the Palæa.591</p>
<p>For thirty years indeed after the attack made upon the illustrious Eustathius they had
gone on enduring the abomination of Arianism, in the expectation of some favourable
change. But when they saw impiety on the increase, and men faithful to the apostolic doctrines
both openly attacked and menaced by secret conspiracy, the divine Meletius in exile,
and Euzoius the champion of heresy established as bishop in his place, they remembered
the words spoken to Lot, “Escape for thy life”;592 and further the law of the gospel which
plainly ordains “if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee.”593 The Lord
laid down the same law about both hand and foot, and added, “It is profitable for thee that
one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.”

The narrative of Sozomen (iv. 28) enables us to supply what Theodoret infelicitously omits. It was when an
Arian archdeacon rudely put his hand over the bishop’s mouth that Meletius indicated the orthodox doctrine
by his fingers. When the archdeacon at his wits’ end uncovered the mouth and seized the hand of the confessor,
“with a loud voice he the more clearly proclaimed his doctrine.”</note>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—About Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.</head>
<p>The admirable Eusebius mentioned above, who was entrusted with the common resolution,
when he beheld the violation of the covenant, returned to his own see. Then certain
men who were uneasy about the written document, persuaded Constantius to dispatch a
messenger to recover it. Accordingly the emperor sent one of the officers who ride post with
relays of horses, and bring communications with great speed. On his arrival he reported the
imperial message, but, “I cannot,” said the admirable Eusebius, “surrender the deed deposited
with me till I am directed so to do by the whole assembly who gave it me.” This reply was
reported to the emperor. Boiling with rage he sent to Eusebius again and ordered him to
give it up, with the further message that he had ordered his right hand to be cut off if he
refused. But he only wrote this to terrify the bishop, for the courier who conveyed the dispatch
had orders not to carry out the threat. But when the divine Eusebius opened the letter and
saw the punishment which the emperor had threatened, he stretched out his right hand and
his left, bidding the man cut off both. “The decree,” said he, “which is a clear proof of Arian
wickedness, I will not give up.”</p>
<p>When Constantius had been informed of this courageous resolution he was struck with
astonishment, and did not cease to admire it; for even foes are constrained by the greatness
of bold deeds to admire their adversaries success.</p>
<p>At this time Constantius learned that Julian, whom he had declared Cæsar of Europe,
was aiming at sovereignty, and mustering an army against his master. Therefore he set out
from Syria, and died in Cilicia.594 Nor had he the helper whom his Father had left him; for
he had not kept intact the inheritance of his Father’s piety, and so bitterly bewailed his
change of faith.</p>
<note type="footnote">594 Constantius died at Mopsucrene, on the Cydnus, according to Socrates and the Chron. Alex., on Nov. 3,
361. Socrates (ii. 47) ascribes his illness to chagrin at the successes of Julian, and says that he died in the 46th
year of his age and 39th of his reign, having for thirteen years been associated in the empire with his Father.
Ammianus (xxi. 15, 2) writes, “Venit Tarsum, ubi leviore febri contactus, ratusque itinerario motu imminutae
valetudinis excuti posse discrimen, petiit per vias difficiles Mopsucrenas, Cillciae ultimam hinc pergentibus
stationem, sub Tauri montis radicibus positam: egredique sequuto die conatus, invalenti morbi gravitate detentus
est: paulatimque urente calore nimio venas, ut ne tangi quidem corpus eius posset in modum foculi fervens,
cum usus deficeret medelarum, ultimum spirans deflebat exitium; mentisque sensu tum etiam integro, successorem

colluctatus iam discessura, abiit e vita III. Non. Octobrium, (i.e. Oct. 5—a different date from that given by
others) imperii vitaeque anno quadragesimo et mensibus paucis.” His Father having died in 337, Constantius
really reigned 24 years alone, and if we include the 13 years which Socrates reckons in the lifetime of Constantine,
we only reach 37. He was born on Aug. 6, 317, and was therefore a little over 44 at his death. “Constantius was
essentially a little man, in whom his father’s vices took a meaner form.” “The peculiar repulsiveness of Constan-</note>

been turned away from the faith of his father. Julian heard the news of his end as he was
crossing from Europe into Asia and assumed the sovereignty with delight at having now no
rival.</p>
<p>In his earlier days, while yet a lad, Julian had, as well as Gallus595 his brother, imbibed
pure and pious teaching.</p>
<p>In his youth and earlier manhood he continued to take in the same doctrine. Constantius,
dreading lest his kinsfolk should aspire to imperial power, slew them;596 and Julian,
through fear of his cousin, was enrolled in the order of Readers,597 and used to read aloud
the sacred books to the people in the assemblies of the church.</p>

and the præfect Abcavius.” “If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene we might add that
Constantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius, and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage
on his cousin Hannibalianus.” “Of so numerous a family Gallus and Julian alone, the two youngest children of
Julius Constantius, were saved from the hands of the assassins, till their rage, satiated with slaughter, had in
some measure subsided.” Gibbon, Chap. xviii. Theodoretus follows the opinion of Athanasius and Julian in
ascribing the main guilt to Constantius, but, as Gibbon points out, Eutropius and the Victors “use the very
qualifying expressions;” “sinente potius quam jubente;” “incertum quo suasore;” and “vi militum.” Gregory of
Nazianzus (Or. iv. 21) ascribes the preservation of both Julian and his brother Gallus to the clemency and protection
of Constantius.</note>

<p>He also built a martyr’s shrine; but the martyrs, when they beheld his apostasy, refused
to accept the offering; for in consequence of the foundations being, like their founder’s
mind, unstable, the edifice fell down598 before it was consecrated. Such were the boyhood
and youth of Julian. At the period, however, when Constantius was setting out for the West,
drawn thither by the war against Magnentius, he made Gallus, who was gifted with piety
which he retained to the end,599 Cæsar of the East. Now Julian flung away the apprehensions
which had previously stood him in good stead, and, moved by unrighteous confidence, set
his heart on seizing the sceptre of empire. Accordingly, on his way through Greece, he sought
out seers and soothsayers, with a desire of learning if he should get what his soul longed for.
He met with a man who promised to predict these things, conducted him into one of the
idol temples, introduced him within the shrine, and called upon the demons of deceit. On
their appearing in their wonted aspect terror compelled Julian to make the sign of the cross
upon his brow. They no sooner saw the sign of the Lord’s victory than they were reminded
of their own rout, and forthwith fled away. On the magician becoming acquainted with the
cause of their flight he blamed him; but Julian confessed his terror, and said that he wondered
at the power of the cross, for that the demons could not endure to see its sign and ran away.
“Think not anything of the sort, good sir;” said the magician, “they were not afraid as you
make out, but they went away because they abominated what you did.” So he tricked the
wretched man, initiated him in the mysteries, and filled him with their abominations.</p>
<p>So lust of empire stripped the wretch of all true religion. Nevertheless after attaining
the supreme power he concealed his impiety for a considerable time; for he was specially
apprehensive about the troops who had been instructed in the principles of true religion,
first by the illustrious Constantine who freed them from their former error and trained them
in the ways of truth, and afterwards by his sons, who confirmed the instruction given by
their father. For if Constantius, led astray by those under whose influence he lived, did not
admit the term ὁμοούσιον, at all events he sincerely accepted the meaning underlying it,
for God the Word he styled true Son, begotten of his Father before the ages, and those who

<p>I will relate also another of his noble deeds, as satisfactory proof of his zeal for divine
things. In his campaign against Magnentius he once mustered the whole of his army, and
counselled them to take part all together in the divine mysteries, “for,” said he, “the end of
life is always uncertain, and that not least in war, when innumerable missiles are hurled
from either side, and swords and battle axes and other weapons are assailing men, whereby
a violent death is brought about. Wherefore it behoves each man to wear that precious robe
which most of all we need in yonder life hereafter: if there be one here who would not now
put on this garb let him depart hence and go home. I shall not brook to fight with men in
my army who have no part nor lot in our holy rites.”600</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Of the return of the bishops and the consecration of Paulinus.</head>
<p>Julian had clear information on these points, and did not make known the impiety of
his soul. With the object of attracting all the bishops to acquiescence in his rule he ordered
even those who had been expelled from their churches by Constantius, and who were sojourning
on the furthest confines of the empire, to return to their own churches. Accordingly,
on the promulgation of this edict, back to Antioch came the divine Meletius, and to Alexandria
the far famed Athanasius.601</p>
<p>But Eusebius,602 and Hilarius603 of Italy and Lucifer604 who presided over the flock in
the island of Sardinia, were living in the Thebaid on the frontier of Egypt, whither they had
been relegated by Constantius. They now met with the rest whose views were the same and
affirmed that the churches ought to be brought into harmony. For they not only suffered
from the assaults of their opponents, but were at variance with one another. In Antioch the
sound body of the church had been split in two; at one and the same time they who from
the beginning, for the sake of the right worthy Eustathius, had separated from the rest, were
assembling by themselves; and they who with the admirable Meletius had held aloof from
the Arian faction were performing divine service in what is called the Palæa. Both parties
used one confession of faith, for both parties were champions of the doctrine laid down at
Nicæa. All that separated them was their mutual quarrel, and their regard for their respective
leaders; and even the death of one of these did not put a stop to the strife. Eustathius died
before the election of Meletius, and the orthodox party, after the exile of Meletius and the
election of Euzoius, separated from the communion of the impious, and assembled by
themselves; with these, the party called Eustathians could not be induced to unite. To effect
<note type="footnote">601 The accession of Julian was made known in Alexandria at the end of Nov. 361, and the Pagans at once
rose against George, imprisoned him, and at last on Dec. 24, brutally beat and kicked him to death. The Arians
appointed a successor—Lucius, but on Feb. 22 Athanasius once more appeared among his faithful flock, and
lost no time in getting a Council for the settlement of several moot points of discipline and doctrine, which
Theodoret proceeds to enumerate.</note>

an union between them the Eusebians and Luciferians sought to discover a means. Accordingly
Eusebius besought Lucifer to repair to Alexandria and take counsel on the matter with
the great Athanasius, intending himself to undertake the labour of bringing about a reconciliation.</p>
<p>Lucifer however did not go to Alexandria but repaired to Antioch. There he urged many
arguments in behalf of concord on both parties. The Eustathians, led by Paulinus, a presbyter,
persisted in opposition. On seeing this Lucifer took the improper course of consecrating
Paulinus as their bishop.</p>
<p>This action on the part of Lucifer prolonged the feud, which lasted for eighty-five years,
until the episcopate of the most praise-worthy Alexander.605</p>
<p>No sooner was the helm of the church at Antioch put into his hands than he tried every
expedient, and brought to bear great zeal and energy for the promotion of concord, and
thus joined the severed limb to the rest of the body of the church. At the time in question
however Lucifer made the quarrel worse and spent a considerable time in Antioch, and
Eusebius when he arrived on the spot and learnt that bad doctoring had made the malady
very hard to heal, sailed away to the West.</p>
<p>When Lucifer returned to Sardinia he made certain additions to the dogmas of the
church and those who accepted them were named after him, and for a considerable time
were called Luciferians. But in time the flame of this dogma too went out and it was consigned
to oblivion.606 Such were the events that followed on the return of the bishops.</p>
<note type="footnote">605 cf. p. 41. Eustathius died about 337, at Philippi,—probably about six years after his deposition. Alexander,
an ascetic (cf. post, V. Ch. 35) did not become bishop of Antioch till 413.</note>
<note type="footnote">606 The raison d’etre of the Luciferians as a distinct party was their unwillingness to accept communion with
men who had ever lapsed into Arianism. Jerome gives 371 as the date of Lucifer’s death. “To what extent he was
an actual schismatic remains obscure.” St. Ambrose remarks that “he had separated himself from our communion,”
(de excessu Satyri 1127, 47) and St. Augustine that “he fell into the darkness of schism, having lost the
light of charity.” (Ep. 185 n. 47.) But there is no mention of any separation other than Lucifer’s own repulsion
of so many ecclesiastics; and Jerome in his dialogue against the Luciferians (§20) calls him “beatus and bonus
pastor.” J. Ll. Davies in Dict. Christ. Biog. s.v.</note>

<head>Chapter III.—Of the number and character of the deeds done by Pagans against the Christians
when they got the power from Julian.</head>
<p>When Julian had made his impiety openly known the cities were filled with dissensions.
Men enthralled by the deceits of idolatry took heart, opened the idols’ shrines, and began
to perform those foul rites which ought to have died out from the memory of man. Once
more they kindled the fire on the altars, befouled the ground with victims’ gore, and defiled
the air with the smoke of their burnt sacrifices. Maddened by the demons they served they
ran in corybantic607 frenzy round about the streets, attacked the saints with low stage jests,
and with all the outrage and ribaldry of their impure processions.</p>
<p>On the other hand the partizans608 of piety could not brook their blasphemies, returned
insult for insult, and tried to confute the error which their opponents honoured. In their
turn the workers of iniquity took it ill; the liberty allowed them by the sovereign was an
encouragement to audacity and they dealt deadly blows among the Christians.</p>
<p>It was indeed the duty of the emperor to consult for the peace of his subjects, but he in
the depth of his iniquity himself maddened his peoples with mutual rage. The deeds dared
by the brutal against the peaceable he overlooked and entrusted civil and military offices of
importance to savage and impious men, who though they hesitated publicly to force the
lovers of true piety to offer sacrifice treated them nevertheless with all kinds of indignity.
All the honours moreover conferred on the sacred ministry by the great Constantine Julian
took away.</p>
<p>To tell all the deeds dared by the slaves of idolatrous deceit at that time would require
a history of these crimes alone, but out of the vast number of them I shall select a few instances.
At Askalon and at Gaza, cities of Palestine, men of priestly rank and women who
had lived all their lives in virginity were disembowelled, filled with barley, and given for
food to swine. At Sebaste, which belongs to the same people, the coffin of John the Baptist
was opened, his bones burnt, and the ashes scattered abroad.609</p>
<note type="footnote">607 Corybantes, the name of the priests of Cybele, whose religious service consisted in noisy music and wild
armed dances, is a word of uncertain origin. The chief seat of their rites was Pessinus in Galatia.</note>

west of the extreme part of the city, where the Cyclobion was, and where the Seven Towers now are; and that</note>

<p>Who too could tell without a tear the vile deed done in Phoenicia? At Heliopolis610 by
Lebanon there lived a certain deacon of the name of Cyrillus. In the reign of Constantine,
fired by divine zeal, he had broken in pieces many of the idols there worshipped. Now men
of infamous name, bearing this deed in mind, not only slew him, but cut open his belly and
devoured his liver. Their crime was not, however, hidden from the all-seeing eye, and they
suffered the just reward of their deeds; for all who had taken part in this abominable
wickedness lost their teeth, which all fell out at once, and lost, too, their tongues, which
rotted away and dropped from them: they were moreover deprived of sight, and by their
sufferings proclaimed the power of holiness.</p>
<p>At the neighbouring city of Emesa611 they dedicated to Dionysus, the woman-formed,
the newly erected church, and set up in it his ridiculous androgynous image. At
Dorystolum,612 a famous city of Thrace, the victorious athlete Æmilianus was thrown upon
a flaming pyre, by Capitolinus, governor of all Thrace. To relate the tragic fate of Marcus,
however, bishop of Arethusa,613 with true dramatic dignity, would require the eloquence
of an Æschylus or a Sophocles. In the days of Constantius he had destroyed a certain idolshrine
and built a church in its place; and no sooner did the Arethusians learn the mind of
Julian than they made an open display of their hostility. At first, according to the precept
of the Gospel,614 Marcus endeavoured to make his escape; but when he became aware that
some of his own people were apprehended in his stead, he returned and gave himself up to
the men of blood. After they had seized him they neither pitied his old age nor reverenced
his deep regard for virtue; but, conspicuous as he was for the beauty alike of his teaching
and of his life, first of all they stripped and smote him, laying strokes on every limb, then
they flung him into filthy sewers, and, when they had dragged him out again, delivered him
to a crowd of lads whom they charged to prick him without mercy with their pens.615 After
<note type="footnote">the Seven Towers being about six Roman miles from the Seraglio Point, which is the apex of the triangle formed
by the city, the phrase at the seventh milestone is thus accounted for. Bones alleged to be parts of the scull are
still shewn at Amiens. The same emperor built a church for the body on the site of the Serapeum at Alexandria.</note>

laws against true religion. First of all he prohibited the sons of the Galileans, for so he tried

and philosophy, for said he, in the words of the proverb “we are shot with shafts feathered

<head>Chapter V.—Of the fourth exile and flight of the holy Athanasius.</head>
<p>At this time Athanasius, that victorious athlete of the truth, underwent another peril,
for the devils could not brook the power of his tongue and prayers, and so armed their
ministers to revile him. Many voices did they utter beseeching the champion of wickedness
to exile Athanasius, and adding yet this further, that if Athanasius remained, not a heathen
would remain, for that he would get them all over to his side. Moved by these supplications
Julian condemned Athanasius not merely to exile,618 but to death. His people shuddered,
but it is related that he foretold the rapid dispersal of the storm, for said he “It is a cloud
which soon vanishes away.” He however withdrew as soon as he learnt the arrival of the
bearers of the imperial message, and finding a boat on the bank of the river, started for the
Thebaid. The officer who had been appointed for his execution became acquainted with his
flight, and strove to pursue him at hot haste; one of his friends, however, got ahead, and
told him that the officer was coming on apace. Then some of his companions besought him
to take refuge in the desert, but he ordered the steersman to turn the boat’s head to Alexandria.
So they rowed to meet the pursuer, and on came the bearer of the sentence of execution,
and, said he, “How far off is Athanasius?” “Not far,” said Athanasius,619 and so got rid of
his foe, while he himself returned to Alexandria and there remained in concealment for the
remainder of Julian’s reign.620</p>
<note type="footnote">618 The crowning outrage which moved Julian to put out the edict of exile was the baptism by the bishop of
some pagan ladies. The letter of Julian (Ep. p. 187) fixed Dec. 1st, 362, as the limit of Athanasius’ permission to
stay in Egypt, but it was on Oct. 23d (Fest. Ind.) that the order was communicated to him.</note>

<head>Chapter VI.—Of Apollo and Daphne, and of the holy Babylas.</head>
<p>Julian, wishing to make a campaign against the Persians, dispatched the trustiest of his
officers to all the oracles throughout the Roman Empire, while he himself went as a suppliant
to implore the Pythian oracle of Daphne to make known to him the future. The oracle responded
that the corpses lying hard by were becoming an obstacle to divination; that they
must first be removed to another spot; and that then he would utter his prophecy, for, said
he, “I could say nothing, if the grove be not purified.” Now at that time there were lying
there the relics of the victorious martyr Babylas621 and the lads who had gloriously suffered
with him, and the lying prophet was plainly stopped from uttering his wonted lies by the
holy influence of Babylas. Julian was aware of this, for his ancient piety had taught him the
power of victorious martyrs, and so he removed no other body from the spot, but only
ordered the worshippers of Christ to translate the relics of the victorious martyrs. They
marched with joy to the grove,622 put the coffin on a car and went before it leading a vast
concourse of people, singing the psalms of David, while at every pause they shouted “Shame
be to all them that worship molten images.”623 For they understood the translation of the
martyr to mean defeat for the demon.</p>
<note type="footnote">621 Babylas, bishop of Antioch from 238 to 251, was martyred in the Decian persecution either by death in
prison (Euseb. H. E. vi. 39 μετὰ τὴν ὁμολογίαν ἐν δεσμωτηρίU+0026 251· μεταλλάξαντος) or by violence. (Chrys. de
s. B. c. gentes) “Babylas had won for himself a name by his heroic courage as bishop of Antioch. It was related
of him that on one occasion when the emperor Philip, who was a Christian, had presented himself one Easter
Eve at the time of prayer, he had boldly refused admission to the sovereign, till he had gone through the proper
discipline of a penitent for some offence committed. (Eus. H. E. vi. 34.) He acted like a good shepherd, says
Chrysostom, who drives away the scabby sheep, lest it should infect the flock.” Bp. Lightfoot, Ap. Fathers II. i.

<head>Chapter VII.—Of Theodorus the Confessor.</head>
<p>Julian could not endure the shame brought upon him by these doings, and on the following
day ordered the leaders of the choral procession to be arrested. Sallustius was prefect
at this time and a servant of iniquity, but he nevertheless was anxious to persuade the sovereign
not to allow the Christians who were eager for glory to attain the object of their desires.
When however he saw that the emperor was impotent to master his rage, he arrested a young
man adorned with the graces of a holy enthusiasm while walking in the Forum, hung him
up before the world on the stocks, lacerated his back with scourges, and scored his sides
with claw-like instruments of torture. And this he did all day from dawn till the day was
done; and then put chains of iron on him and ordered him to be kept in ward. Next morning
he informed Julian of what had been done, and reported the young man’s constancy and
added that the event was for themselves a defeat and for the Christians a triumph. Persuaded
of the truth of this, God’s enemy suffered no more to be so treated and ordered Theodorus624
to be let out of prison, for so was named this young and glorious combatant in truth’s battle.
On being asked if he had had any sense of pain on undergoing those most bitter and most
savage tortures he replied that at the first indeed he had felt some little pain, but that then
had appeared to him one who continually wiped the sweat from his face with a cool and
soft kerchief and bade him be of good courage. “Wherefore,” said he, “when the executioners
gave over I was not pleased but vexed, for now there went away with them he who brought
me refreshment of soul.” But the demon of lying divination at once increased the martyr’s
glory and exposed his own falsehood; for a thunderbolt sent down from heaven burnt the
whole shrine625 and turned the very statue of the Pythian into fine dust, for it was made of
wood and gilded on the surface. Julianus the uncle of Julian, prefect of the East, learnt this
by night, and riding at full speed came to Daphne, eager to bring succour to the deity whom
he worshipped; but when he saw the so-called god turned into powder he scourged the of-

<head>Chapter VIII.—Of the confiscation of the sacred treasures and taking away of the allowances.627</head>
<p>Even when the wicked had become acquainted with these events they set themselves in
array against the God of all; and the prince ordered the holy vessels to be handed over to
the imperial treasury. Of the great church which Constantine had built he nailed up the
doors and declared it closed to the worshippers wont to assemble there. At this time it was
in possession of the Arians. In company with Julianus the prefect of the East, Felix the imperial
treasurer, and Elpidius, who had charge of the emperor’s private purse and property,
an officer whom it is the Roman custom to call “Comes privatarum,”628 made their way
into the sacred edifice. Both Felix and Elpidius, it is said, were Christians, but to please the
impious emperor apostatised from the true religion. Julianus committed an act of gross indecency
on the Holy Table629 and, when Euzoius endeavoured to prevent him, gave him a
blow on the face, and told him, so the story goes, that it is the fate of the fortunes of Christians
to have no protection from the gods. But Felix, as he gazed upon the magnificence of the
sacred vessels, furnished with splendour by the munificence of Constantine and Constantius,
“Behold,” said he, “with what vessels Mary’s son is served.” But it was not long before they
paid the penalty of these deeds of mad and impious daring.</p>

polluted mouth, at the instant of his blasphemy, became the organ for their emission.</p>

“Husband, you ought to bless our Saviour Christ for shewing you through your castigation

if with his wonted long suffering he had refrained from visiting you with these heaven-sent

<head>Chapter X.—Of the Son of the Priest.</head>
<p>A young man who was a priest’s son, and brought up in impiety, about this time went
over to the true religion. For a lady remarkable for her devotion and admitted to the order
of deaconesses631 was an intimate friend of his mother. When he came to visit her with his
mother, while yet a tiny lad, she used to welcome him with affection and urge him to the
true religion. On the death of his mother the young man used to visit her and enjoyed the
advantage of her wonted teaching. Deeply impressed by her counsels, he enquired of his
teacher by what means he might both escape the superstition of his father and have part
and lot in the truth which she preached. She replied that he must flee from his father, and
honour rather the Creator both of his father and himself; that he must seek some other city
wherein he might lie hid and escape the violence of the impious emperor; and she promised
to manage this for him. Then, said the young man, “henceforward I shall come and commit
my soul to you.” Not many days afterwards Julian came to Daphne, to celebrate a public
feast. With him came the young man’s father, both as a priest, and as accustomed to attend
the emperor; and with their father came the young man and his brother, being appointed
to the service of the temple and charged with the duty of ceremonially sprinkling the imperial
viands. It is the custom for the festival of Daphne to last for seven days. On the first day
the young man stood by the emperor’s couch, and according to the prescribed usage aspersed
the meats, and thoroughly polluted them. Then at full speed he ran to Antioch,632 and
making his way to that admirable lady, “I am come,” said he, “to you; and I have kept my
promise. Do you look to the salvation of each and fulfil your pledge.” At once she arose and
conducted the young man to Meletius the man of God, who ordered him to remain for
awhile upstairs in the inn. His father after wandering about all over Daphne in search of the
boy, then returned to the city and explored the streets and lanes, turning his eyes in all directions
and longing to light upon his lad. At length he arrived at the place where the divine
Meletius had his hostelry; and looking up he saw his son peeping through the lattice. He
ran up, drew him along, got him down, and carried him off home. Then he first laid on him
many stripes, then applied hot spits to his feet and hands and back, then shut him up in his
bedroom, bolted the door on the outside, and returned to Daphne. So I myself have heard
the man himself narrate in his old age, and he added further that he was inspired and filled
with Divine Grace, and broke in pieces all his father’s idols, and made mockery of their
helplessness. Afterwards when he bethought him of what he had done he feared his father’s
return and besought his Master Christ to nod approval of his deeds,633 break the bolts, and

“Even as I thus spoke,” he told me, “out fell the bolts and open flew the doors, and back I
ran to my instructress. She dressed me up in women’s garments and took me with her in
her covered carriage back to the divine Meletius. He handed me over to the bishop of Jerusalem,
at that time Cyril, and we started by night for Palestine.” After the death of Julian
this young man led his father also into the way of truth. This act he told me with the rest.

<head>Chapter XI.—Of the Holy Martyrs Juventinus and Maximinus.</head>
<p>Now Julian, with less restraint, or shall I say, less shame, began to arm himself against
true religion, wearing indeed a mask of moderation, but all the while preparing gins and
traps which caught all who were deceived by them in the destruction of iniquity. He began
by polluting with foul sacrifices the wells in the city and in Daphne, that every man who
used the fountain might be partaker of abomination. Then he thoroughly polluted the things
exposed in the Forum, for bread and meat and fruit and vegetables and every kind of food
were aspersed. When those who were called by the Saviour’s name saw what was done, they
groaned and bewailed and expressed their abomination; nevertheless they partook, for they
remembered the apostolic law, “Everything that is sold in the shambles eat, asking no
question for conscience sake.”634 Two officers in the army, who were shield bearers in the
imperial suite, at a certain banquet lamented in somewhat warm language the abomination
of what was being done, and employed the admirable language of the glorious youths at
Babylon, “Thou hast given us over to an impious Prince, an apostate beyond all the nations
on the earth.”635 One of the guests gave information of this, and the emperor arrested these
right worthy men and endeavoured to ascertain by questioning them what was the language
they had used. They accepted the imperial enquiry as an opportunity for open speech, and
with noble enthusiasm replied “Sir we were brought up in true religion; we were obedient
to most excellent laws, the laws of Constantine and of his sons; now we see the world full
of pollution, meats and drinks alike defiled with abominable sacrifices, and we lament. We
bewail these things at home, and now before thy face we express our grief, for this is the one
thing in thy reign which we take ill.” No sooner did he whom sympathetic courtiers called
most mild and most philosophic hear these words than he took off his mask of moderation,
and exposed the countenance of impiety. He ordered cruel and painful scourgings to be
inflicted on them and deprived them of their lives; or shall we not rather say freed them
from that sorrowful time and gave them crowns of victory? He pretended indeed that punishment
was inflicted upon them not for the true religion for sake of which they were really
slain, but because of their insolence, for he gave out that he had punished them for insulting
the emperor, and ordered this report to be published abroad, thus grudging to these champions
of the truth the name and honour of martyrs. The name of one was Juventinus; of the
other Maximinus. The city of Antioch honoured them as defenders of true religion, and

<head>Chapter XII.—Of Valentinianus the great Emperor.</head>
<p>Valentinianus,637 who shortly afterwards became emperor, was at that time a Tribune
and commanded the Hastati quartered in the palace. He made no secret of his zeal for the
true religion. On one occasion when the infatuated emperor was going in solemn procession
into the sacred enclosure of the Temple of Fortune, on either side of the gates stood the
temple servants purifying, as they supposed, all who were coming in, with their sprinkling
whisks. As Valentinianus walked before the emperor, he noticed that a drop had fallen on
his own cloak and gave the attendant a blow with his fist, “for,” said he, “I am not purified
but defiled.” For this deed he won two empires. On seeing what had happened Julian the
accursed sent him to a fortress in the desert, and ordered him there to remain, but after the
lapse of a year and a few months he received the empire as a reward of his confession of the
faith, for not only in the life that is to come does the just Judge honour them that care for
holy things, but sometimes even here below He bestows recompense for good deeds, confirming
the hope of guerdons yet to be received by what he gives in abundance now.</p>
<p>But the tyrant devised another contrivance against the truth, for when according to
ancient custom he had taken his seat upon the imperial throne to distribute gold among the
ranks of his soldiery, contrary to custom he had an altar full of hot coals introduced, and
incense put upon a table, and ordered each man who was to receive the gold first to throw
incense on the altar, and then to take the gold from his own right hand. The majority were
wholly unaware of the trap thus laid; but those who were forewarned feigned illness and so
escaped this cruel snare. Others in their eagerness for the money made light of their salvation
while another group abandoned their faith through cowardice.</p>

<p>After this fatal distribution of money some of the recipients were feasting together at
an entertainment. One of them who had taken the cup in his hand did not drink before
making on it the sign of salvation.638</p>
<p>One of the guests found fault with him for this, and said that it was quite inconsistent
with what had just taken place. “What,” said he, “have I done that is inconsistent?”
Whereupon he was reminded of the altar and the incense, and of his denial of the faith; for
these things are all contrary to the Christian profession. When they heard this the greater
number of the feasters moaned and bewailed themselves, and tore out handfuls of hair from
their heads. They rose from the banquet, and ran through the Forum exclaiming that they
were Christians, that they had been tricked by the emperor’s contrivances, that they retracted
their apostasy, and were ready to try to undo the defeat which had befallen them unwittingly.
With these exclamations they ran to the palace loudly inveighing against the wiles of the
tyrant, and imploring that they might be committed to the flames in order that, as they had
been befouled by fire, by fire they might be made clean. All these utterances drove the villain
out of his senses, and on the impulse of the moment he ordered them to be beheaded; but
as they were being conducted without the city the mass of the people started to follow them,
wondering at their fortitude and glorying in their boldness for the truth. When they had
reached the spot where it was usual to execute criminals, the eldest of them besought the
executioner that he would first cut off the head of the youngest, that he might not be unmanned
by beholding the slaughter of the rest. No sooner had he knelt down upon the
ground and the headsman bared his sword, than up ran a man announcing a reprieve, and
while yet afar off shouting out to stop the execution. Then the youngest soldier was distressed
at his release from death. “Ah,” said he, “Romanus” (his name was Romanus) “was not
worthy of being called Christ’s martyr.” What influenced the vile trickster in stopping the
execution was his envy: he grudged the champions of the faith their glory. Their sentence
was commuted to relegation beyond the city walls and to the remotest regions of the empire.</p>

<p>These and like these were the deeds of the man whom the impious describe as the
mildest and least passionate of men.</p>
<p>I will now include in my history the noble story of a right excellent woman, for even
women, armed with divine zeal, despised the mad fury of Julian.</p>
<p>In those days there was a woman named Publia, of high reputation, and illustrious for
deeds of virtue. For a short time she wore the yoke of marriage, and had offered its most
goodly fruit to God, for from this fair soil sprang John, who for a long time was chief presbyter
at Antioch, and was often elected to the apostolic see, but from time to time declined
the dignity. She maintained a company of virgins vowed to virginity for life, and spent her
time in praising God who had made and saved her. One day the emperor was passing by,
and as they esteemed the Destroyer an object of contempt and derision, they struck up all
the louder music, chiefly chanting those psalms which mock the helplessness of idols, and
saying in the words of David “The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, the work of
men’s hands,”641 and after describing their insensibility, they added “like them be they that
make them and all those that trust in them.”642 Julian heard them, and was very angry, and
told them to hold their peace while he was passing by. She did not however pay the least
attention to his orders, but put still greater energy into their chaunt, and when the emperor
passed by again told them to strike up “Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered.”643
On this Julian in wrath ordered the choir mistress to be brought before him; and, though
he saw that respect was due to her old age, he neither compassionated her gray hairs, nor
respected her high character, but told some of his escort to box both her ears, and by their
violence to make her cheeks red. She however took the outrage for honour, and returned
home, where, as was her wont, she kept up her attack upon him with her spiritual songs,644
just as the composer and teacher of the song laid the wicked spirit that vexed Saul.</p>
<note type="footnote">639 By the Constitution of Constantine the supreme military command was given to a “Magister equitum”
and a “Magister peditum.” Under them were a number of “Duces” and “Comites,” Dukes and Counts, with

<head>Chapter XV.—Of the Jews; of their attempt at building, and of the heaven-sent plagues that
befel them.</head>
<p>Julian, who had made his soul a home of destroying demons, went his corybantic way,
ever raging against true religion. He accordingly now armed the Jews too against the believers
in Christ. He began by enquiring of some whom he got together why, though their law imposed
on them the duty of sacrifices, they offered none. On their reply that their worship
was limited to one particular spot, this enemy of God immediately gave directions for the
re-erection of the destroyed temple,645 supposing in his vanity that he could falsify the
prediction of the Lord, of which, in reality, he exhibited the truth.646 The Jews heard his
words with delight and made known his orders to their countrymen throughout the world.
They came with haste from all directions, contributing alike money and enthusiasm for the
work; and the emperor made all the provisions he could, less from the pride of munificence
than from hostility to the truth. He despatched also as governor a fit man to carry out his
impious orders. It is said that they made mattocks, shovels, and baskets of silver. When they
had begun to dig and to carry out the earth a vast multitude of them went on with the work
all day, but by night the earth which had been carried away shifted back from the ravine of
its own accord. They destroyed moreover the remains of the former construction, with the
intention of building everything up afresh; but when they had got together thousands of
bushels of chalk and lime, of a sudden a violent gale blew, and storms, tempests and whirlwinds
scattered everything far and wide. They still went on in their madness, nor were they
brought to their senses by the divine longsuffering. Then first came a great earthquake, fit
to strike terror into the hearts of men quite ignorant of God’s dealings; and, when still they
were not awed, fire running from the excavated foundations burnt up most of the diggers,
and put the rest to flight. Moreover when a large number of men were sleeping at night in
an adjacent building it suddenly fell down, roof and all, and crushed the whole of them. On
that night and also on the following night the sign of the cross of salvation was seen brightly
shining in the sky, and the very garments of the Jews were filled with crosses, not bright but
black.647 When God’s enemies saw these things, in terror at the heaven-sent plagues they

return from the Persian war and there give glory to the Supreme Being. It is addressed to his “brother Julus, the

“Chrysostom (Ed. Montfaucon, vol. v. 271, etc.) mentions ‘crosses imprinted upon garments,’ as a sign that had

<note type="footnote">648 This event “came like the vision of Constantine, at a critical epoch in the world’s history. It was as the
heathen poet has it, a ‘dignus vindice nodus.’ All who were present or heard of the event at the time, thought,
we may be sure, that it was a sign from God. As a miracle then it ranges beside those biblical miracles in which,
at some critical moment, the forces of nature are seen to work strikingly for God’s people or against their enemies.
In the O.T. we have for example, the instances of the plagues of Egypt, the passage of the Red Sea and the
drowning of Pharaoh’s host, the crossing of the Jordan, the prolongation of sunlight” (?darkness. Vide “A misunderstood
miracle” by the Rev. A. Smythe Palmer) “the destruction of Sennacherib’s army; in the N.T. the
stilling of the storm, and the earthquake and the darkness at the crucifixion.” Bp. Wordsworth. Dict. Ch. Biog.
ii. 513. To biblical instances may be added the defeat of Sisera and the fall of Aphek. But, too, for “the forces of
nature,” when the Armada was scattered, or when the siege of Leyden was raised the course of modern history
would have been changed. Cressy may also be cited. On the evidence for this event as contrasted with the so-called
ecclesiastical miracles, accepted and defended by the late Cardinal Newman, vide Dr. E. A. Abbott’s Philomythus pp. 1
and 5 et seq. “There is better evidence for this than for any of the preceding miracles.” “The real solid testimony is that
of Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 1). An impartial historian, who served under Julian in the Persian campaign, and who,
twenty years afterwards, recorded the interruption of the building of the Temple by terrible balls of fire.” “If Ammianus
had lived nearer the time of the alleged incident, or had added a statement of the evidence on which he based his stories,
the details might have been defended. As it is, the circumstances, while favouring belief in his veracity do not justify us
in accepting anything more than the fact that the rebuilding of the Temple was generally believed to have been stopped
by some supernatural fiery manifestation.” “The rebuilding was probably stopped by a violent thunderstorm or thunderstorms.”</note>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Of the expedition against the Persians.</head>
<p>No sooner had the Persians heard of the death of Constantius, than they took heart,
proclaimed war, and marched over the frontier of the Roman empire. Julian therefore determined
to muster his forces, though they were a host without a God to guard them. First
he sent to Delphi, to Delos and to Dodona, and to the other oracles649 and enquired of the
seers if he should march. They bade him march and promised him victory. One of these
oracles I subjoin in proof of their falsehood. It was as follows. “Now we gods all started to
get trophies of victory by the river beast and of them I Ares, bold raiser of the din of war,
will be leader.”650 Let them that style the Pythian a God wise in word and prince of the
muses ridicule the absurdity of the utterance. I who have found out its falsehood will rather
pity him who was cheated by it. The oracle called the Tigris “beast” because the river and
the animal bear the same name. Rising in the mountains of Armenia, and flowing through
Assyria it discharges itself into the Persian gulf. Beguiled by these oracles the unhappy man
indulged in dreams of victory, and after fighting with the Persians had visions of a campaign
against the Galileans, for so he called the Christians, thinking thus to bring discredit on
them. But, man of education as he was, he ought to have bethought him that no mischief is
done to reputation by change of name, for even had Socrates been called Critias and Pythagoras
Phalaris they would have incurred no disgrace from the change of name—nor yet
would Nireus if he had been named Thersites651 have lost the comeliness with which nature
<note type="footnote">649 This is probably the last occasion on which the moribund oracles were consulted by any one of importance.
Of Delphi, the “navel of the earth” (Strabo ix. 505) in Phocis, Cicero had written some four centuries earlier
“Cur isto modo jam oracula Delphi non eduntur, non modo nostra ætate, sed jam diu, ut nihil possit esse contemptius:”
Div. ii. 57. Plutarch, who died about a.d. 120, wrote already “de defectu oraculorum.” The oracle of
Apollo at Delos was consulted only in the summer months, as in the winter the god was supposed to be at Patara:
so Virgil (iv. 143) writes “Qualis ubi hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta Deserit, ac Delum maternam invisit
Apollo.” Dodona in Epirus was the most ancient of the oracular shrines, where the suppliant went “——ὅφρα
θεοῖο ἐκ δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο Διὸς βουλὴν ἐπακούσαι.” Od. xiv. 327. “The oracles” were potentially “dumb,”
“Apollo…with hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving,” as Milton sings, at the Nativity, but it was not till the reign
of Theodosius that they were finally silenced.</note>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Of the boldness of speech of the decurion of Beroea.652</head>
<p>After starting with these threats he was put down by one single Beroean. Illustrious as
this man was from the fact of his holding the chief place among the magistrates, he was
made yet more illustrious by his zeal. On seeing his son falling into the prevailing paganism,
he drove him from his home and publicly renounced him. The youth made his way to the
emperor in the near neighbourhood of the city and informed him both of his own views
and of his father’s sentence. The emperor bade him make his mind easy and promised to
reconcile his father to him. When he reached Beroea, he invited the men of office and of
high position to a banquet. Among them was the young suppliant’s father, and both father
and son were ordered to take their places on the imperial couch. In the middle of the enter-
tainment Julian said to the father, “It does not seem to me to be right to force a mind otherwise
inclined and having no wish to shift its allegiance. Your son does not wish to follow
your doctrines. Do not force him. Even I, though I am easily able to compel you, do not try
to force you to follow mine.” Then the father, moved by his faith in divine truth to sharpen
the debate, exclaimed “Sir,” said he “are you speaking of this wretch whom God hates653
and who has preferred lies to truth?”</p>
<p>Once more Julian put on the mask of mildness and said “Cease fellow from reviling,”
and then, turning his face to the youth, “I,” said he, “will have care for you, since I have not
been able to persuade your father to do so.” I mention this circumstance with a distinct wish
to point out not only this worthy man’s admirable boldness, but that very many persons
despised Julian’s sway.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Of the prediction of the pedagogue.</head>
<p>Another instance is that of an excellent man at Antioch, entrusted with the charge of
young lads, who was better educated than is usually the case with pedagogues,654 and was
the intimate friend of the chief teacher of that period, Libanius the far-famed sophist.</p>
<p>Now Libanius655 was a heathen expecting victory and bearing in mind the threats of
Julian, so one day, in ridicule of our belief he said to the pedagogue, “What is the carpenter’s
son about now?” Filled with divine grace, he foretold what was shortly to come to pass.
“Sophist,” said he, “the Creator of all things, whom you in derision call carpenter’s son, is
making a coffin.”656</p>
<p>After a few days the death of the wretch was announced. He was carried out lying in his
coffin. The vaunt of his threats was proved vain, and God was glorified.657</p>
<note type="footnote">654 The word seems here used in its strictly Athenian sense of a slave who took charge of boys on their way
between school and home (Vide Lycias 910. 2 and Plat. Rep. 373. C.) rather than in the more general sense of

in the Septuagint. In 2 Chron. xxiv. 8 (cf. 2 Kings xii. 9) it means a chest. In St. John’s Gospel xii. 6 and xiii. 29
it is “the bag,” properly (xi. 3) “box,” which Judas carried. In the Palatine anthology Nicanor the coffin maker
makes these “glossokoma” or coffins. Derivatively the word means “tongue-cases,” i.e. cases to keep the tongues
or reeds of musical instruments. An instance of similar transfer of meaning is our word “coffin;” derivatively a
wicker basket;—at one time any case or cover, and in Shakespeare (Titus Andronicus Act V. 2, 189) pie crust.
Perhaps “casket,” which now still holds many things, may one day only hold a corpse.</note>

favourably with the fierce zeal of the Christians. A modern illustration of the temper of the Church in Julian’s
reign may be found in the following account given of his dragoman by the late author of “Eothen.” “Religion
and the literature of the Church which he served had made him a man, and a brave man too. The lives of his
honored Saints were full of heroic actions provoking imitation, and since faith in a creed involves faith its ultimate
triumph, Dthemetri was bold from a sense of true strength; his education too, though not very general in its
character, had been carried quite far enough to justify him in pluming himself upon a very decided advantage
over the great bulk of the Mahometan population, including the men in authority. With all this consciousness
of religious and intellectual superiority, Dthemetri had lived for the most part in countries lying under Mussulman
governments, and had witnessed (perhaps too had suffered from) their revolting cruelties; the result was that
he abhorred and despised the Mussulman faith and all who clung to it. And this hate was not of the dull, dry,
and inactive sort; Dthemetri was in his way a true crusader, and whenever there appeared a fair opening in the</note>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Of the Prophecy of St. Julianus the monk.</head>
<p>A man who in the body imitated the lives of the bodiless, namely Julianus, surnamed
in Syrian Sabbas, whose life I have written in my “Religious History,” continued all the more
zealously to offer his prayers to the God of all, when he heard of the impious tyrant’s threats.
On the very day on which Julian was slain, he heard of the event while at his prayers, although
the Monastery was distant more than twenty stages from the army. It is related that while
he was invoking the Lord with loud cries and supplicating his merciful Master, he suddenly
checked his tears, broke into an ecstasy of delight, while his countenance was lighted up
and thus signified the joy that possessed his soul. When his friends beheld this change they
begged him to tell them the reason of his gladness. “The wild boar,” said he, “the enemy of
the vineyard of the Lord, has paid the penalty of the wrongs he has done to Him; he lies
dead. His mischief is done.” The whole company no sooner heard these words than they
leaped with joy and struck up the song of thanksgiving to God, and from those that brought
tidings of the emperor’s death they learnt that it was the very day and hour when the accursed
man was slain that the aged Saint knew it and announced it.658</p>
<note type="footnote">defence of Islam, he was ready and eager to make the assault. Such feelings, backed by a consciousness of understanding
the people with whom he had to do, made Dthemetri not only firm and resolute in his constant interviews
with men in authority, but sometimes also very violent and very insulting.” Kinglake’s “Eothen,” 5th Ed., p. 270.</note>

morning of June 26th, 363, and died at midnight. On the somewhat similar stories of Apollonius of Tyana

moment when Domitian was being murdered at Rome (Dion Cass, 67. 18); and of Irenæus at Rome hearing a
voice as of a trumpet at the exact hour when Polycarp suffered at Smyrna proclaiming ‘Polycarp has been martyred’
(Vid. Ep. Smyrn.). Bp. Lightfoot (Apostolic Fathers 1. 455) writes “The analogies of authenticated records of
apparitions seen and voices heard at a distance at the moment of death have been too frequent in all ages to allow
us to dismiss the story at once as a pure fiction.” Such narratives at all events testify to a wide-spread belief.</note>

<head>Chapter XX.—Of the death of the Emperor Julian in Persia.</head>
<p>Julian’s folly was yet more clearly manifested by his death. He crossed the river that
separates the Roman Empire from the Persian,659 brought over his army, and then forthwith
burnt his boats, so making his men fight not in willing but in forced obedience.660 The best
generals are wont to fill their troops with enthusiasm, and, if they see them growing discouraged,
to cheer them and raise their hopes; but Julian by burning the bridge of retreat cut off
all good hope. A further proof of his incompetence was his failure to fulfil the duty of foraging
in all directions and providing his troops with supplies. Julian had neither ordered supplies
to be brought from Rome, nor did he make any bountiful provision by ravaging the enemy’s
country. He left the inhabited world behind him, and persisted in marching through the
wilderness. His soldiers had not enough to eat and drink; they were without guides; they
were marching astray in a desert land. Thus they saw the folly of their most wise emperor.
In the midst of their murmuring and grumbling they suddenly found him who had struggled
in mad rage against his Maker wounded to death. Ares who raises the war-din had never
come to help him as he promised; Loxias had given lying divination; he who glads him in
the thunderbolts had hurled no bolt on the man who dealt the fatal blow; the boasting of
his threats was dashed to the ground. The name of the man who dealt that righteous stroke
no one knows to this day. Some say that he was wounded by an invisible being, others by
one of the Nomads who were called Ishmaelites; others by a trooper who could not endure
the pains of famine in the wilderness. But whether it were man or angel who plied the steel,
without doubt the doer of the deed was the minister of the will of God. It is related that
when Julian had received the wound, he filled his hand with blood, flung it into the air and
cried, “Thou hast won, O Galilean.” Thus he gave utterance at once to a confession of the
victory and to a blasphemy. So infatuated was he.661</p>

ἥλιε would not be so dissimilar in Greek as in English. Ammianus Marcellinus (xxv. 3. 9.) says that he lost all
hope of recovery when he heard that the place where he lay was called Phrygia, for in Phrygia he had been told
that he would die. So it befell with Cambyses at Ecbatana (Her. iii. 64), Alexander King of Epirus at the Acheron
(Livy viii. 24) and Henry IV in the Jerusalem Chamber, when he asked “Doth any name particular belong unto
this lodging where I first did swoon?” and on hearing that the chamber was called Jerusalem, remembered the
old prediction that in Jerusalem he must die, and died.</note>

<p>Julian had left Edessa on his left because it was adorned with the grace of true religion,
and while in his vain folly he was journeying through Carræ, he came to the temple honoured
by the impious and after going through certain rites with his companions in defilement, he
locked and sealed the doors, and stationed sentinels with orders to see that none came in
till his return. When news came of his death, and the reign of iniquity was succeeded by
one of piety, the shrine was opened, and within was found a proof of the late emperor’s
manliness, wisdom, and piety.662 For there was seen a woman hung up on high by the hairs
of her head, and with her hands outstretched. The villain had cut open her belly, and so I

<head>Chapter XXII.—Of the heads discovered in the palace at Antioch and the public rejoicings
there.</head>
<p>It is said that at Antioch a number of chests were discovered at the palace filled with
human heads, and also many wells full of corpses. Such is the teaching of the evil deities.</p>
<p>When Antioch heard of Julian’s death she gave herself up to rejoicing and festivity; and
not only was exultant joy exhibited in the churches, and in the shrines of martyrs, but even
in the theatres the victory of the cross was proclaimed and Julian’s vaticination held up to
ridicule. And here I will record the admirable utterance of the men at Antioch, that it may
be preserved in the memory of generations yet to come, for with one voice the shout was
raised, “Maximus, thou fool, where are thy oracles? for God has conquered and his Christ.”
This was said because there lived at that time a man of the name of Maximus, a pretender
to philosophy, but really a worker of magic, and boasting himself to be able to foretell the
future. But the Antiochenes, who had received their divine teaching from the glorious
yokefellows Peter and Paul, and were full of warm affection for the Master and Saviour of
all, persisted in execrating Julian to the end. Their sentiments were perfectly well known to
the object of them, and so he wrote a book against them and called it “Misopogon.”664</p>
<note type="footnote">664 “The residence of Julian at Antioch was a disappointment to himself, and disagreeable to almost all the
inhabitants.” “He had anticipated much more devotion on the part of the pagans, and much less force and resistance
on that of the Christians than he discovered in reality. He was disgusted at finding that both parties regretted
the previous reign. ‘Neither the Chi nor the Kappa’ (that is neither Christ nor Constantius) ‘did our city
any harm’ became a common saying (Misopogon p. 357). To the heathens themselves the enthusiastic form of
religion to which Julian was devoted was little more than an unpleasant and somewhat vulgar anachronism. His
cynic asceticism and dislike of the theatre and the circus was unpopular in a city particularly addicted to public
spectacles. His superstition was equally unpalatable. The short, untidy, long-bearded man, marching pompously
in procession on the tips of his toes, and swaying his shoulders from side to side, surrounded by a crowd of
abandoned characters, such as formed the regular attendants upon many heathen festivals, appeared seriously
to compromise the dignity of the empire. (Ammianus xxii. 14. 3. His words ‘stipatus mulierculis’ etc. go far to
justify Gregory’s δημοσίU+0026 139· ταίς πορναίς προὔπινε in Orat. v. 22. p. 161, and Chrysostom’s more highly
coloured description of the same sort of scene, for the accuracy of which he appeals to an eye witness still living,
de S. Babyla in Julianum §14. p. 667. The blood of countless victims flowed everywhere, but, to all appearance,
served merely to gorge his foreign soldiery, especially the semi-barbarous Gauls, and the streets of Antioch were
disturbed by their revels and by drunken parties carrying one another home to their barracks. (Amm. xxii. 12.
6.)” “More secret rumours were spread of horrid nocturnal sacrifices, and of the pursuits of those arts of necromancy
from which the natural heathen conscience shrank only less than the Christians.” “He discharged his
spleen upon the general body of the citizens of Antioch by writing one of the most remarkable satires that has
ever been published which he entitled the Misopogon. ‘He had been insulted,’ says Gibbon, ‘by satire and libels;
in his turn he composed under the title of The Enemy of the Beard, an ironical confession of his own faults, and</note>

before the gates of the palace, and the Misopogon still remains a singular monument of the resentment, the wit,
the inhumanity, and the indiscretion of Julian. Gibbon, Chap. xxiv.’ It is of course Julian’s own philosophic
beard that gives the title to the pamphlet.” “This pamphlet was written in the seventh month of his sojourn at
Antioch, probably the latter half of January.” (1. c. 364.) Bp. J. Wordsworth in Dict. Ch. Biog. iii. 507., 509.</note>

<head>Chapter I.—Of the reign and piety of Jovianus</head>
<p>After Julian was slain the generals and prefects met in council and deliberated who
ought to succeed to the imperial power and effect both the salvation of the army in the
campaign, and the recovery of the fortunes of Rome, now, by the rashness of the deceased
Emperor, placed to use the common saying, on the razor edge of peril.665 But while the
chiefs were in deliberation the troops met together and demanded Jovianus for emperor,
though he was neither a general nor in the next highest rank; a man however remarkably
distinguished, and for many reasons well known. His stature was great; his soul lofty. In
war, and in grave struggles it was his wont to be first. Against impiety he delivered himself
courageously with no fear of the tyrant’s power, but with a zeal that ranked him among the
martyrs of Christ. So the generals accepted the unanimous vote of the soldiers as a divine
election. The brave man was led forward and placed upon a raised platform hastily constructed.
The host saluted him with the imperial titles, calling him Augustus and Cæsar. With
his usual bluntness, and fearless alike in the presence of the commanding officers and in
view of the recent apostasy of the troops, Jovianus admirably said “I am a Christian. I cannot
govern men like these. I cannot command Julian’s army trained as it is in vicious discipline.
Men like these, stripped of the covering of the providence of God, will fall an easy and ridiculous
prey to the foe.” On hearing this the troops shouted with one voice, “Hesitate not,
O emperor; think it not a vile thing to command us. You shall reign over Christians nurtured
in the training of truth; our veterans were taught in the school of Constantine himself;
younger men among us were taught by Constantius. This dead man’s empire lasted but a
few years, all too few to stamp its brand even on those whom it deceived.”666</p>

<note type="footnote">666 Jovianus, son of Count Varronianus of Singidunum (Belgrade), was born in 330 or 331 and reigned from
June 363 to February 364. His hasty acceptance by a part of the army may have been due to the mistake of the
sound of “Jovianus Augustus” for that of “Julianus Augustus” and a belief that Julian survived. “Gentilitate enim
prope perciti nominis, quod una littera discernebat, Julianum recreatum arbitrati sunt deduci magnis favoribus,
ut solebat.” Amm. xxv. v. 6. “Jovian was a brilliant colonel of the guards. In all the army there was not a goodlier person
than he. Julian’s purple was too small for his gigantic limbs. But that stately form was animated by a spirit of cowardly
selfishness. Jovian was also a decided Christian,” but “even the heathen soldiers condemned his low amours and vulgar
tippling.” Gwatkin, “Arian Controversy,” 119.</note>

<head>Chapter II.—Of the return of Athanasius.</head>
<p>Delighted with these words the emperor undertook for the future to take counsel for
the safety of the state, and how to bring home the army without loss from the campaign.
He was in no need of much deliberation, but at once reaped the fruit sprung from the seeds
of true religion, for the God of all gave proof of His own providence, and caused all difficulty
to disappear. No sooner had the Persian sovereign been made acquainted with Jovian’s accession
than he sent envoys to treat for peace; nay more, he despatched provisions for the
troops and gave directions for the establishment of a market for them in the desert. A truce
was concluded for thirty years, and the army brought home in safety from the war.667 The
first edict of the emperor on setting foot upon his own territory was one recalling the bishops
from their exile, and announcing the restoration of the churches to the congregations who
had held inviolate the confession of Nicæa. He further sent a despatch to Athanasius, the
famous champion of these doctrines, beseeching that a letter might be written to him containing
exact teaching on matters of religion. Athanasius summoned the most learned
bishops to meet him, and wrote back exhorting the emperor to hold fast the faith delivered
at Nicæa, as being in harmony with apostolic teaching. Anxious to benefit all who may meet
with it I here subjoin the letter.668</p>

prophet who stakes his credit on the truth of his prediction, but little more than a pious reflection, of the nature
of a wish.” Bp. J. Wordsworth, Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 463. n. Jortin says “the good bishop’s μαντική failed him

<head>Chapter III.—Synodical letter to the Emperor Jovian concerning the Faith.</head>
<p>To Jovianus Augustus most devout, most humane, victorious, Athanasius, and the rest
of the bishops assembled, in the name of all the bishops from Egypt to Thebaid, and Libya.
The intelligent preference and pursuit of holy things is becoming to a prince beloved of
God. Thus may you keep your heart in truth in God’s hand and reign for many years in
peace.669 Since your piety has recently expressed a wish to learn from us the faith of the
Catholic Church, we have given thanks to the Lord and have determined before all to remind
your reverence of the faith confessed by the fathers at Nicæa. This faith some have set at
nought, and have devised many and various attacks on us, because of our refusal to submit
to the Arian heresy. They have become founders of heresy and schism in the Catholic Church.
The true and pious faith in our Lord Jesus Christ has been made plain to all as it is known
and read from the Holy Scriptures. In this faith the martyred saints were perfected, and now
departed are with the Lord. This faith was destined everywhere to stand unharmed, had not
the wickedness of certain heretics dared to attempt its falsification; for Arius and his party
endeavoured to corrupt it and to bring in impiety for its destruction, alleging the Son of
God to be of the nonexistent, a creature, a Being made, and susceptible of change. By these
means they deceived many, so that even men who seemed to be somewhat,670 were led away
by them. Then our holy Fathers took the initiative, met, as we said, at Nicæa, anathematized
the Arian heresy, and subscribed the faith of the Catholic Church so as to cause the putting
out of the flames of heresy by proclamation of the truth throughout the world. Thus this
faith throughout the whole church was known and preached. But since some men who
wished to start the Arian heresy afresh have had the hardihood to set at naught the faith
confessed by the Fathers at Nicæa, and others are pretending to accept it, while in reality
they deny it, distorting the meaning of the ὁμοούσιον and thus blaspheming the Holy Ghost,
by alleging it to be a creature and a Being made through the Son’s means, we, perforce beholding
the harm accruing from blasphemy of this kind to the people, have hastened to offer
to your piety the faith confessed at Nicæa, that your reverence may know with what exactitude
it is drawn up, and how great is the error of them whose teaching contradicts it. Know, O
holiest Augustus, that this faith is the faith preached from everlasting, this is the faith that
the Fathers assembled at Nicæa confessed. With this faith all the churches throughout the

the common editions of Athanasius, and Baronius supposes it to have been added by some Arian, with the object
of ridiculing Athanasius as a false prophet. As a fact the reign of Jovian was short. But I see nothing low, spurious
or factitious. Athanasius is not in fault because Jovian did not live as long as he had wished.”</note>

world are in agreement, in Spain, in Britain,671 in Gaul, in all Italy and Campania, in Dalmatia
and Mysia, in Macedonia, in all Hellas, in all the churches throughout Africa,
Sardinia, Cyprus, Crete, Pamphylia and Isauria, and Lycia, those of all Egypt and Libya, of
Pontus, Cappadocia and the neighbouring districts and all the churches of the East except
a few who have embraced Arianism. Of all those above mentioned we know the sentiments
after trial made. We have letters and we know, most pious Augustus, that though some few
gainsay this faith they cannot prejudice672 the decision of the whole inhabited world.</p>
<p>After being long under the injurious influence of the Arian heresy they are the more
contentiously withstanding true religion. For the information of your piety, though indeed
you are already acquainted with it, we have taken pains to subjoin the faith confessed at
Nicæa by these three hundred and eighteen bishops. It is as follows.</p>
<p>We believe in one God, Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and
in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, that is of the substance of
the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God: begotten not made, being of
one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made both in Heaven and in earth.
Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven, was incarnate and was
made man. He suffered and rose again the third day. He ascended into Heaven, and is
coming to judge both quick and dead. And we believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church anathematizes those who say there was a time when the Son of God
was not; that before He was begotten He was not; that He was made out of the non-existent,
or that He is of a different essence or different substance, or a creature or subject to variation
or change. In this faith, most religious Augustus, all must needs abide as divine and
apostolic, nor must any strive to change it by persuasive reasoning and word battles, as from
the beginning did the Arian maniacs in their contention that the Son of God is of the nonexistent,
and that there was a time when He was not, that He is created and made and subject
to variation. Wherefore, as we stated, the council of Nicæa anathematized this heresy and
confessed the faith of the truth. For they have not simply said that the Son is like the Father,
that he may be believed not to be simply like God but very God of God. And they promulgated
the term “Homoüsion” because it is peculiar to a real and true son of a true and natural
father. Yet they did not separate the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, but rather

Augustine. But by about 208 the fame of British Christianity had reached Tertullian in Africa. The date, that of
the first mention of the Church in Britain, indicates a probable connexion of its foundation with the dispersion
of the victims of the persecution of the Rhone cities. The phrase of Tertullian, “places beyond the reach of the

Christian graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity. As Gregory of Nazianzus says (Orat. xiii. p. 24) Τριὰς οὐ πραγμάτων

proper force, means either the number Three or a triad. It is first applied to the mystery of the Three in One by
Tertullian, who says that the Church ‘proprie et spiritualiter ipse est spiritus, in quo est Trinitas unius divinitatis,

<head>Chapter IV.—Of the restoration of allowances to the churches; and of the Emperor’s death.</head>
<p>When the emperor had received this letter, his former knowledge of and disposition to
divine things was confirmed, and he issued a second edict wherein he ordered the amount
of corn which the great Constantine had appropriated to the churches to be restored.674
For Julian, as was to be expected of one who had gone to war with our Lord and Saviour,
had stopped even this maintenance, and since the famine which visited the empire in consequence
of Julian’s iniquity prevented the collection of the contribution of Constantine’s
enactment, Jovian ordered a third part to be supplied for the present, and promised that on
the cessation of the famine he would give the whole.</p>
<p>After distinguishing the beginning of his reign by edicts of this kind, Jovian set out from
Antioch for the Bosphorus; but at Dadastanæ, a village lying on the confines of Bithynia
and Galatia, he died.675 He set out on his journey from this world with the grandest and
fairest support and stay, but all who had experienced the clemency of his sway were left behind
in pain. So, methinks, the Supreme Ruler, to convict us of our iniquity, both shews us
good things and again deprives us of them; so by the former means He teaches us how easily
He can give us what He will; by the latter He convicts us of our unworthiness of it, and
points us to the better life.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Of the reign of Valentinianus, and how he associated Valens his brother with
him.</head>
<p>When the troops had become acquainted with the emperor’s sudden death, they wept
for the departed prince as for a father, and made Valentinian emperor in his room. It was
he who smote the officer of the temple676 and was sent to the castle. He was distinguished
not only for his courage, but also for prudence, temperance, justice, and great stature. He
was of so kingly and magnanimous a character that, on an attempt being made by the army
to appoint a colleague to share his throne, he uttered the well-known words which are universally
repeated, “Before I was emperor, soldiers, it was yours to give me the reins of empire:
now that I have taken them, it is mine, not yours, to take counsel for the state.” The troops
were struck with admiration at what he said, and contentedly followed the guidance of his
authority. Valentinian, however, sent for his brother from Pannonia, and shared the empire
with him. Would that he had never done so! To Valens,677 who had not yet accepted unsound
doctrines, was committed the charge of Asia and of Egypt, while Valentinian allotted Europe
to himself. He journeyed to the Western provinces, and beginning with a proclamation of
true religion, instructed them in all righteousness. When the Arian Auxentius, bishop of
Milan, who was condemned in several councils, departed this life,678 the emperor summoned
the bishops and addressed them as follows: “Nurtured as you have been in holy writ, you
know full well what should be the character of one dignified by the episcopate, and how he
should rule his subjects aright, not only with his lip, but with his life; exhibit himself as an
example of every kind of virtue, and make his conversation a witness of his teaching. Seat
now upon your archiepiscopal throne a man of such character that we who rule the realm
may honestly bow our heads before him and welcome his reproofs,—for, in that we are men,
it needs must be that we sometimes stumble,—as a physician’s healing treatment.”</p>
<note type="footnote">676 Vide page 101. “Valentinian belongs to the better class of Emperors. He was a soldier like Jovian, and
held the same rank at his election. He was a decided Christian like Jovian, and, like him, free from the stain of
persecution. Jovian’s rough good humour was replaced in Valentinian by a violent and sometimes cruel temper,
but he had a sense of duty, and was free from Jovian’s vices.” Gwatkin, Arian Cont. 121.</note>
<note type="footnote">677 “Valens was timid, suspicious, and slow, yet not ungentle in private life. He was as uncultivated as his
brother, but not inferior to him in scrupulous care for his subjects. He preferred remitting taxation to fighting
at the head of the legions. In both wars he is entitled to head the series of financial rather than unwarlike sovereigns
whose cautious policy brought the Eastern Empire safely through the great barbarian invasions of the fifth
century.” Gwatkin, p. 121.</note>

<head>Chapter VI.—Of the election of Ambrosius, the Bishop of Milan.</head>
<p>Thus spoke the emperor, and then the council begged him, being a wise and devout
prince, to make the choice. He then replied, “The responsibility is too great for us. You who
have been dignified with divine grace, and have received illumination from above, will make
a better choice.” So they left the imperial presence and began to deliberate apart. In the
meanwhile the people of Milan were torn by factions, some eager that one, some that another,
should be promoted. They who had been infected with the unsoundness of Auxentius were
for choosing men of like opinions, while they of the orthodox party were in their turn anxious
to have a bishop of like sentiments with themselves. When Ambrosius, who held the chief
civil magistracy679 of the district, was apprised of the contention, being afraid lest some
seditious violence should be attempted he hurried to the church; at once there was a lull in
the strife. The people cried with one voice “Make Ambrose our pastor,”—although up to
this time he was still680 unbaptized. News of what was being done was brought to the emperor,
and he at once ordered the admirable man to be baptized and ordained, for he knew
that his judgment was straight and true as the rule of the carpenter and his sentence more
exact than the beam of the balance. Moreover he concluded from the agreement come to
by men of opposite sentiments that the selection was divine. Ambrose then received the
divine gift of holy baptism, and the grace of the archiepiscopal office. The most excellent
emperor was present on the occasion and is said to have offered the following hymn of
praise to his Lord and Saviour. “We thank thee, Almighty Lord and Saviour; I have committed
to this man’s keeping men’s bodies; Thou hast entrusted to him their souls, and hast shown
my choice to be righteous.”</p>
<p>Not many days after the divine Ambrosius addressed the emperor with the utmost
freedom, and found fault with certain proceedings of the magistrates as improper.
Valentinian remarked that this freedom was no novelty to him, and that, well acquainted
with it as he was, he had not merely offered no opposition to, but had gladly concurred in,
the appointment to the bishopric. “Go on,” continued the emperor, “as God’s law bids you,
healing the errors of our souls.”</p>

this Trinity be preached, so that none may say “We accept the religion of the sovereign who

blood of Zacharias,692 but he and his were destroyed by our Heavenly King Jesus Christ
after (at) His coming, being delivered to death’s judgment, they and the deadly fiend who
abetted them. We have given these orders to Amegetius, to Ceronius to Damasus, to Lampon
and to Brentisius by word of mouth, and we have sent the actual decrees to you also in order
that you may know what was enacted in the honourable synod.</p>
<p>To this letter we subjoin the decrees of the synod, which are briefly as follows.</p>
<p>In accordance with the great and orthodox synod we confess that the Son is of one
substance with the Father. And we do not so understand the term ‘of one substance’ as some
formerly interpreted it who signed their names with feigned adhesion; nor as some who
now-a-days call the drafters of the old creed Fathers, but make the meaning of the word of
no effect, following the authors of the statement that “of one substance” means “like,” with
the understanding that since the Son is comparable to no one of the creatures made by Him,
He is like to the Father alone. For those who thus think irreverently define the Son “as a
special creation of the Father,” but we, with the present synods, both at Rome and in Gaul,
hold that there is one and the same substance of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in three persons,
that is in three perfect essences.693 And we confess, according to the exposition of
<note type="footnote">perio incrementa capiatis et cum eo qui vos incitat conculcetis sanguinem foederis, fere ut Zachariæ tempore factum
est a Judæis.”</note>
<note type="footnote">692 It is to be observed that the imperial letter does not add the probably interpolated words “son of Barachias”
which are a difficulty in Matt. xxiii. 35, and do not appear in the Codex Sinaiticus.</note>
<note type="footnote">693 Here for the first time in our author we meet with the word Hypostasis to denote each distinct person.
Compare note on page 36. “Origen had already described Father, Son and Holy Spirit as three ὑποστάσεις or
Beings, in opposition to the Monarchians, who saw in them only three modes of manifestation of one and the
same Being. And as Sabellius had used the words τρία πρόσωπα for these modes of manifestation, this form of
expression naturally fell into disfavour with the Catholics. But when Arius insisted on (virtually) three different
hypostases in the Holy Trinity, Catholics began to avoid applying the word hypostases to the Persons of the
Godhead. To this was added a difficulty arising from the fact, that the Eastern Church used Greek as the official
language of its theology, while the Western Church used Latin, a language at that time much less well provided
with abstract theological terms. Disputes were caused, says Gregory of Nazianzus (Orat. xxi. p. 395), διὰ στενότητα
τῆς παρὰ τοῖς ᾽Ιτάλοις γλώττης καὶ ὀνομάτων πενίαν. (Compare Seneca Epist. 58.) The Latins used essentia
and substantia as equivalent to the Greek οὐσία and ὑπόστασις, but interchanged them, as we have seen in the
translation of the Nicene Creed with little scruple, regarding them as synonyms. They used both expressions to
describe the Divine Nature common to the Three. It followed that they looked upon the expression “Three
Hypostases” as implying a division of the substance of the Deity, and therefore as Arian. They preferred to speak
of “tres Personæ.” Athanasius also spoke of τρία πρόσωπα, and thus the words πρόσωπα and Personæ became
current among the Nicene party. But about the year 360, the Neo-Nicene party, or Meletians, as they are sometimes
called, became scrupulous about the use of such an expression as τρία πρόσωπα, which seemed to them to savour</note>

Nicæa, that the Son of God being of one substance, was made flesh of the Holy Virgin Mary,
and hath tabernacled among men, and fulfilled all the economy694 for our sakes in birth,
in passion, in resurrection, and in ascension into Heaven; and that He shall come again to
render to us according to each man’s manner of life, in the day of judgment, being seen in
the flesh, and showing forth His divine power, being God bearing flesh, and not man bearing
Godhead.</p>
<p>Them that think otherwise we damn, as we do also them that do not honestly damn
him that said that before the Son was begotten He was not, but wrote that even before He
was actually begotten He was potentially in the Father. For this is true in the case of all
creatures, who are not for ever with God in the sense in which the Son is ever with the
Father, being begotten by eternal generation.</p>

<p>“The bishops of Illyricum to the churches of God, and bishops of the dioceses of Asia,
of Phrygia, and Carophrygia Pacatiana, greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“After meeting together and making long enquiry concerning the Word of salvation,
we have set forth that the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is of one substance. And
it seemed fitting to pen a letter to you, not that we write what concerns the worship of the
Trinity in vain disputation, but in humility deemed worthy of the duty.</p>
<p>“This letter we have sent by our beloved brother and fellow labourer Elpidius the presbyter.
For not in the letters of our hands, but in the books of our Saviour Jesus Christ, is it
written ‘I am of Paul and I of Apollos and I of Cephas and I of Christ. Was Paul crucified
for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?’695</p>
<p>“It seemed indeed fitting to our humility not to pen any letter to you, on account of the
great terror which your preaching causes to all the region under your jurisdiction, separating
as you do the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son. We were therefore constrained to send
to you our lord and fellow labourer Elpidius to ascertain if your preaching is really of this
character and to carry this dispatch from the imperial government of Rome.</p>
<p>“Let them who do not regard the Trinity as one substance be anathema, and if any man
be detected in communion with them let him be anathema.</p>
<p>“But for them that preach that the Trinity is of one substance the Kingdom of Heaven
is prepared.</p>
<p>“We exhort you therefore brethren to teach no other doctrine, nor even hold any other
and vain belief, but that always and everywhere, preaching the Trinity to be of one substance,
ye may be able to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>“While writing on this point we have also been reminded to pen this letter to you about
the present or future appointment of our fellow ministers as bishops, if there be any sound
men among the bishops who have already discharged a public office;696 and, if not, from
the order of presbyters: in like manner of the appointment of presbyters and deacons out
of the actual priestly697 order that they may be in every way blameless, and not from the

representative of all, our lord and fellow labourer Elpidius, to make diligent enquiry about
your preaching, if it really is such as we have heard from our lord and fellow labourer Eustathius.</p>
<p>“In conclusion, if at any time you have been in error, put off the old man and put on
the new. The same brother and fellow labourer Elpidius will instruct you how to preach the
true faith that the Holy Trinity, of one substance with God the Father, together with the
Son and Holy Ghost, is hallowed, glorified, and made manifest, Father in Son, Son in Father,
with the Holy Ghost for ever and ever. For since this has been made manifest, we shall
manifestly be able to confess the Holy Trinity to be of one substance according to the faith
set forth formerly at Nicæa which the Fathers confirmed. So long as this faith is preached
we shall be able to avoid the snares of the deadly devil. When he is destroyed we shall be
able to do homage to one another in letters of peace while we live in peace.</p>
<p>“We have therefore written to you in order that ye may know the deposition of the
Ariomaniacs, who do not confess that the Son is of the substance of the Father nor the Holy
Ghost. We subjoin their names,—Polychronius, Telemachus, Faustus, Asclepiades, Amantius,

<head>Chapter IX.—Of the heresy of the Audiani.</head>
<p>The illustrious emperor thus took heed of the apostolic decrees, but Audæus, a Syrian
alike in race and in speech, appeared at that time as an inventor of new decrees. He had long
ago begun to incubate iniquities and now appeared in his true character. At first he understood
in an absurd sense the passage “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”698
From want of apprehension of the meaning of the divine Scripture he understood the Divine
Being to have a human form, and conjectured it to be enveloped in bodily parts; for Holy
Scripture frequently describes the divine operations under the names of human parts, since
by these means the providence of God is made more easily intelligible to minds incapable
of perceiving any immaterial ideas. To this impiety Audæus added others of a similar kind.
By an eclectic process he adopted some of the doctrines of Manes699 and denied that the
God of the universe is creator of either fire or darkness. But these and all similar errors are
concealed by the adherents of his faction.</p>
<p>They allege that they are separated from the assemblies of the Church. But since some
of them exact a cursed usury, and some live unlawfully with women without the bond of
wedlock, while those who are innocent of these practices live in free fellowship with the
guilty, they hide the blasphemy of their doctrines by accounting as they do for their living
by themselves. The plea is however an impudent one, and the natural result of Pharisaic
teaching, for the Pharisees accused the Physician of souls and bodies in their question to
the holy Apostles “How is it that your Master eateth with publicans and sinners?”700 and
through the prophet, God of such men says “Which say, ‘come not near me for I am pure’
this is smoke of my wrath.”701 But this is not a time to refute their unreasonable error. I
therefore pass on to the remainder of my narrative.702</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Of the heresy of the Messaliani.</head>
<p>At this time also arose the heresy of the Messaliani. Those who translate their name into
Greek call them Euchitæ.703</p>
<p>They have also another designation which arose naturally from their mode of action.
From their coming under the influence of a certain demon, which they supposed to be the
advent of the Holy Ghost, they are called enthusiasts.704</p>
<p>Men who have become infected with this plague to its full extent shun manual labour
as iniquitous; and, giving themselves over to sloth, call the imaginations of their dreams
prophesyings. Of this heresy Dadoes, Sabbas, Adelphius, Hermas, and Simeones were
leaders, and others besides, who did not hold aloof from the communion of the Church,
alleging that neither good nor harm came of the divine food of which Christ our Master
said “Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood shall live for ever.”705</p>
<p>In their endeavor to hide their unsoundness they shamelessly deny it even after conviction,
and abjure men whose opinions are in harmony with their own secret sentiments.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances Letoius, who was at the head of the church of Melitine,706
a man full of divine zeal, saw that many monasteries, or, shall I rather say, brigands’ caves,
had drunk deep of this disease. He therefore burnt them, and drove out the wolves from
the flock.</p>
<p>In like manner the illustrious Amphilochius707 to whom was committed the charge of
the metropolis of the Lycaonians and who ruled all the people, no sooner learnt that this
pestilence had invaded his diocese than he made it depart from his borders and freed from
its infection the flocks he fed.</p>

<p>Flavianus,708 also, the far famed high-priest of the Antiochenes, on learning that these
men were living at Edessa and attacking with their peculiar poison all with whom they came
in contact, sent a company of monks, brought them to Antioch, and in the following manner
convicted them in their denial of their heresy. Their accusers, he said, were calumniating
them, and the witnesses giving false evidence; and Adelphius, who was a very old man, he
accosted with expressions of kindness, and ordered to take a seat at his side. Then he said
“We, O venerable sir, who have lived to an advanced age, have more accurate knowledge
of human nature, and of the tricks of the demons who oppose us, and have learnt by experience
the character of the gift of grace. But these younger men have no clear knowledge of
these matters, and cannot brook to listen to spiritual teaching. Wherefore tell me in what
sense you say that the opposing spirit retreats, and the grace of the Holy Ghost supervenes.”
The old man was won over by these words and gave vent to all his secret venom, for he said
that no benefit accrues to the recipients of Holy Baptism, and that it is only by earnest
prayer that the in-dwelling demon is driven out, for that every one born into the world derives
from his first father slavery to the demons just as he does his nature; but that when these
are driven away, then come the Holy Ghost giving sensible and visible signs of His presence,
at once freeing the body from the impulse of the passions and wholly ridding the soul of its
inclination to the worse; with the result that there is no more need for fasting that restrains
the body, nor of teaching or training that bridles it and instructs it how to walk aright. And
not only is the recipient of this gift liberated from the wanton motions of the body, but also
clearly foresees things to come, and with the eyes beholds the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>In this wise the divine Flavianus dug into the foul fountain-head and succeeded in laying
bare its streams. Then he thus addressed the wretched old man. “O thou that hast grown
old in evil days, thy own mouth convicts thee, not I, and thou art testified against by thy
own lips.” After their unsoundness had been thus exposed they were expelled from Syria,
and withdrew to Pamphylia, which they filled with their pestilential doctrine.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—In what manner Valens fell into heresy.</head>
<p>I will now pursue the course of my narrative, and will describe the beginning of the
tempest which stirred up many and great billows to buffet the Church. Valens, when he first
received the imperial dignity, was distinguished by his fidelity to apostolic doctrine. But
when the Goths had crossed the Danube and were ravaging Thrace, he determined to assemble
an army and march against them; and accordingly resolved not to take the field
without the garb of divine grace, but first to protect himself with the panoply of Holy Baptism.
709 In forming this resolution he acted at once well and wisely, but his subsequent
conduct betrays very great feebleness of character, resulting in the abandonment of the
truth. His fate was the same as that of our first father, Adam; for he too, won over by the
arguments of his wife, lost his free estate and became not merely a captive but an obedient
listener to woman’s wily words. His wife710 had already been entrapped in the Arian snare,
and now she caught her husband, and persuaded him to fall along with her into the pit of
blasphemy. Their leader and initiator was Eudoxius, who still held the tiller of Constantinople,
with the result that the ship was not steered onwards but sunk711 to the bottom.</p>
<note type="footnote">709 Valens was baptized in 368.</note>

<head>Chapter XII.—How Valens exiled the virtuous bishops.</head>
<p>At the very time of the baptism of Valens Eudoxius bound the unhappy man by an oath
to abide in the impiety of his doctrine, and to expel from every see the holders of contrary
opinions. Thus Valens abandoned the apostolic teaching, and went over to the opposite
faction; nor was it long before he fulfilled the rest of his oath; for from Antioch he expelled
the great Meletius, from Samosata the divine Eusebius, and deprived Laodicea of her admirable
shepherd Pelagius.712 Pelagius had taken on him the yoke of wedlock when a very
young man, and in the very bridal chamber, on the first day of his nuptials, he persuaded
his bride to prefer chastity to conjugal intercourse, and taught her to accept fraternal affection
in the place of marriage union. Thus he gave all honour to temperance, and possessed also
within himself the sister virtues moving in tune with her, and for these reasons he was unanimously
chosen for the bishopric. Nevertheless not even the bright beams of his life and
conversation awed the enemy of the truth. Him, too, Valens relegated to Arabia, the divine
Meletius to Armenia, and Eusebius, that unflagging labourer in apostolic work to Thrace.
Unflagging he was indeed, for when apprised that many churches were now deprived of
their shepherds, he travelled about Syria, Phoenicia and Palestine, wearing the garb of war
and covering his head with a tiara, ordaining presbyters and deacons and filling up the
other ranks of the Church; and if haply he lighted on bishops with like sentiments with his
own, he appointed them to empty churches.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Of Eusebius, bishop of Samosata, and others.</head>
<p>Of the courage and prudence shewn by Eusebius after he had received the imperial edict
which commanded him to depart into Thrace, I think all who have been hitherto ignorant
should hear.713</p>
<p>The bearer of this edict reached his destination in the evening, and was exhorted by
Eusebius to keep silent and conceal the cause of his coming. “For,” said the bishop, “the
multitude has been nurtured in divine zeal, and should they learn why you have come they
will drown you, and I shall be held responsible for your death.” After thus speaking and
performing evening service, as he was wont, the old man started out alone on foot, at
nightfall. He confided his intentions to one of his household servants who followed him
carrying nothing but a cushion and a book. When he had reached the bank of the river (for
the Euphrates runs along the very walls of the town) he embarked in a boat and told the
oarsmen to row to Zeugma.714 When it was day the bishop had reached Zeugma, and
Samosata was full of weeping and wailing, for the above mentioned domestic reported the
orders given him to the friends of Eusebius, and told them whom he wished to travel with
him, and what books they were to convey. Then all the congregation bewailed the removal
of their shepherd, and the stream of the river was crowded with voyagers.</p>
<p>When they came where he was, and saw their beloved pastor, with lamentations and
groanings they shed floods of tears, and tried to persuade him to remain, and not abandon
the sheep to the wolves. But all was of no avail, and he read them the apostolic law which
clearly bids us be subjects to magistrates and authorities.715 When they had heard him some
brought him gold, some silver, some clothes, and others servants, as though he were starting
for some strange and distant land. The bishop refused to take anything but some slight gifts
from his more intimate friends, and then gave the whole company his instruction and his
prayers, and exhorted them to stand up boldly for the apostolic decrees.</p>
<p>Then he set out for the Danube, while his friends returned to their own town, and encouraged
one another as they waited for the assaults of the wolves.</p>
<p>In the belief that I should be wronging them were the warmth and sincerity of their
faith to lack commemoration in my history I shall now proceed to describe it.</p>
<note type="footnote">713 Samosata, the capital of Commagene on the Euphrates, is of interest as the birthplace of Lucian (c. 120)

<p>The Arian faction, after depriving the flock of their right excellent shepherd, set up another
bishop in his place; but not an inhabitant of the city, were he herding in indigence or
blazing in wealth, not a servant, not a handicraftsman, not a hind, not a gardener, nor man
nor woman, whether young or old, came, as had been their wont, to gatherings in church.
The new bishop lived all alone; not a soul looked at him, or exchanged a word with him.
Yet the report is that he behaved with courteous moderation, of which the following instance
is a proof. On one occasion he had expressed a wish to bathe, so his servants shut the doors
of the bath, and kept out all who wished to come in. When he saw the crowd before the
doors he ordered them to be thrown open, and directed that every one should freely use the
bath. He exhibited the same conduct in the halls within; for on observing certain men
standing by him while he bathed he begged them to share the hot water with him. They
stood silent. Thinking their hesitation was due to a respect for him, he quickly arose and
made his way out, but these persons had really been of opinion that even the water was affected
with the pollution of his heresy, and so sent it all down the sinks, while they ordered
a fresh supply to be provided for themselves. On being informed of this the intruder departed
from the city, for he judged that it was insensate and absurd on his part to continue to reside
in a city which detested him, and treated him as a common foe. On the departure of Eunomius
(for this was his name) from Samosata, Lucius, an unmistakable wolf, and enemy of
the sheep, was appointed in his place. But the sheep, all shepherdless as they were, shepherded
themselves, and persistently preserved the apostolic doctrine in all its purity. How the new
intruder was detested the following relation will set forth.</p>
<p>Some lads were playing ball in the market place and enjoying the game, when Lucius
was passing by. It chanced that the ball was dropped and passed between the feet of the ass.
The boys raised an outcry because they thought that their ball was polluted. On perceiving
this Lucius told one of his suite to stop and learn what was going on. The boys lit a fire and
tossed the ball through the flames with the idea that by so doing they purified it. I know
indeed that this was but a boyish act, and a survival of the ancient ways; but it is none the
less sufficient to prove in what hatred the town held the Arian faction.</p>
<p>Lucius however was no follower of the mildness of Eunomius, but persuaded the authorities
to exile many others of the clergy, and despatched the most distinguished champions
of the divine dogmas to the furthest confines of the Roman Empire; Evolcius, a deacon, to
Oasis, to an abandoned village; Antiochus, who had the honour of being related to the great
Eusebius, for he was his brother’s son, and further distinguished by his own honourable
character, and of priestly rank, to a distant part of Armenia. How boldly this Antiochus
contended for the divine decrees will be seen from the following facts. When the divine
Eusebius after his many conflicts, whereof each was a victory, had died a martyr’s death,
the wonted synod of the people was held, and among others came Jovinus then bishop of

<pb n="266"/>
Perrha716 who for some little time had held a communion with the Arians. Antiochus was
unanimously chosen as successor to his uncle. When brought before the holy table and
bidden there to bend the knee, he turned round and saw that Jovinus had put his right hand
on his head. Plucking the hand away he bade him be gone from among the consecrators,
saying that he could not endure a right hand which had received mysteries blasphemously
celebrated.</p>
<p>These events happened somewhat later. At the time I am speaking of he was removed
to the interior of Armenia.</p>
<p>The divine Eusebius was living by the Danube where the Goths were ravaging Thrace
and besieging cities, as is described in his own works.</p>
<note type="footnote">716 Jovinus was a friend of Basil (Ep. 118) as well as of Eusebius of Samosata. Perrha, a town of Euphratensis,

the island of Aradus,717 but when the emperor learnt that innumerable multitudes streamed
thither, because Barses was full of apostolic grace, and drove out sicknesses with a word, he
sent him to Oxyrynchus718 in Egypt; but there too his fame drew all men to him, and the
old man, worthy of heaven, was led off to a remote castle near the country of the barbarians
of that district, by name Pheno. It is said that in Aradus his bed has been preserved to this

<head>Chapter XV.—Of the persecution which took place at Edessa, and of Eulogius and Protogenes,
presbyters of Edessa.</head>
<p>Now a second time Valens, after depriving the flock of their shepherd, had set over them
in his stead a wolf. The whole population had abandoned the city, and were assembled in
front of the town, when he arrived at Edessa. He had given orders to the prefect, Modestus
by name, to assemble the troops under his orders who were accustomed to exact the tribute,
to take all who were present of the armed force, and by inflicting blows with sticks and clubs,
and using if need be their other weapons of war to disperse the gathering multitude. Early
in the morning, while the prefect was executing this order, on his way through the Forum
he saw a woman holding an infant in her arms, and hurrying along at great speed. She had
made light of the troops, and forced her way through their ranks: for a soul fired with divine
zeal knows no fear of man, and looks on terrors of this kind as ridiculous sport. When the
prefect saw her, and understood what had happened, he ordered her to be brought before
him, and enquired whither she was going. “I have heard,” said she, “that assaults are being
planned against the servants of the Lord; I want to join my friends in the faith that I may
share with them the slaughter inflicted by you.” “But the baby,” said the prefect, “what in
the world are you carrying that for?” “That it may share with me,” said she, “the death I long
for.”</p>
<p>When the prefect had heard this from the woman and through her means discovered
the zeal which animated all the people, he made it known to the emperor, and pointed out
the uselessness of the intended massacre. “We shall only reap,” said he “a harvest of discredit
from the deed, and shall fail to quench these people’s spirit.” He then would not allow the
multitude to undergo the tortures which they had expected, and commanded their leaders,
the priests, I mean, and deacons, to be brought before him, and offered them a choice of
two alternatives, either to induce the flock to communicate with the wolf, or be banished
from the town to some remote region. Then he summoned the mass of the people before
him, and in gentle terms endeavoured to persuade them to submit to the imperial decrees,
urging that it was mere madness for a handful of men who might soon be counted to withstand
the sovereign of so vast an empire. The crowd stood speechless. Then the prefect
turned to their leader Eulogius, an excellent man, and said, “Why do you make no answer
to what you have heard me say?” “I did not think,” said Eulogius, “that I must answer, when
I had been asked no question.” “But,” said the prefect, “I have used many arguments to urge
you to a course advantageous to yourselves.” Eulogius rejoined that these pleas had been
urged on all the multitude and that he thought it absurd for him to push himself forward
and reply; “but,” he went on, “should you ask me my individual opinion I will give it you.”
“Well,” said the prefect, “communicate with the emperor.” With pleasant irony Eulogius
continued, “Has he then received the priesthood as well as the empire?” The prefect then
perceiving that he was not speaking seriously took it ill, and after heaping reproaches on

<pb n="269"/>
the old man, added, “I did not say so, you fool; I exhorted you to communicate with those
with whom the Emperor communicates.” To this the old man replied that they had a shepherd
and obeyed his directions, and so eighty of them were arrested, and exiled to Thrace.
On their way thither they were everywhere received with the greatest possible distinction,
cities and villages coming out to meet them and honouring them as victorious athletes. But
envy armed their antagonists to report to the emperor that what had been reckoned disgrace
had really brought great honour on these men; thereupon Valens ordered that they were to
be separated into pairs and sent in different directions, some to Thrace, some to the furthest
regions of Arabia, and others to the towns of the Thebaid; and the saying was that those
whom nature had joined together savage men had put asunder, and divided brother from
brother. Eulogius their leader with Protogenes the next in rank, were relegated to Antinone.719</p>
<p>Even of these men I will not suffer the virtue to fall into oblivion. They found that the
bishop of the city was of like mind with themselves, and so took part in the gatherings of
the Church; but when they saw very small congregations, and on enquiry learnt that the
inhabitants of the city were pagans, they were grieved, as was natural, and deplored their
unbelief. But they did not think it enough to grieve, but to the best of their ability devoted
themselves to making these men whole. The divine Eulogius, shut up in a little chamber,
spent day and night in putting up petitions to the God of the universe; and the admirable
Protogenes, who had received a good education720 and was practised in rapid writing,
pitched on a suitable spot which he made into a boys’ school, and, setting up for a schoolmaster,
he instructed his pupils not only in the art of swift penmanship, but also in the divine
oracles. He taught them the psalms of David and gave them to learn the most important
articles of the apostolic doctrine. One of the lads fell sick, and Protogenes went to his home,
took the sufferer by the hand and drove away the malady by prayer. When the parents of
the other boys heard this they brought him to their houses and entreated him to succour
the sick; but he refused to ask God for the expulsion of the malady before the sick had received
the gift of baptism; urged by their longing for the children’s health, the parents readily acceded,
and won at last salvation both for body and soul. In every instance where he persuaded
any one in health to receive the divine grace, he led him off to Eulogius, and knocking at
the door besought him to open, and put the seal of the Lord on the prey. When Eulogius
was annoyed at the interruption of his prayer, Protogenes used to say that it was much more
essential to rescue the wanderers. In this he was an object of admiration to all who beheld
his deeds, doing such wondrous works, imparting to so many the light of divine knowledge

<pb n="270"/>
and all the while yielding the first place to another, and bringing his prizes to Eulogius. They
rightly conjectured that the virtue of Eulogius was by far the greater and higher.</p>
<p>On the quieting of the tempest and restoration of complete calm, they were ordered to
return home, and were escorted by all the people, wailing and weeping, and specially by the
bishop of the church, who was now deprived of their husbandry. When they reached home,
the great Barses had been removed to the life that knows no pain, and the divine Eulogius
was entrusted with the rudder of the church which he had piloted;721 and to the excellent
Protogenes was assigned the husbandry of Charræ,722 a barren spot full of the thorns of
heathendom and needing abundant labour. But these events happened after peace was restored
to the churches.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Of the holy Basilius, Bishop of Cæsarea, and the measures taken against him
by Valens and the prefect Modestus.</head>
<p>Valens, one might almost say, deprived every church of its shepherd, and set out for
the Cappadocian Cæsarea,723 at that time the see of the great Basil, a light of the world. Now
he had sent the prefect before him with orders either to persuade Basil to embrace the
communion of Eudoxius, or, in the event of his refusal, to punish him by exile. Previously
acquainted as he was with the bishop’s high reputation, he was at first unwilling to attack
him, for he was apprehensive lest the bishop, by boldly meeting and withstanding his assault,
should furnish an example of bravery to the rest. This artful stratagem was as ineffective as
a spider’s web. For the stories told of old were quite enough for the rest of the episcopate,
and they kept the wall of the faith unmoved like bastions in the circle of its walls.</p>
<p>The prefect, however, on his arrival at Cæsarea, sent for the great Basil. He treated him
with respect, and, addressing him with moderate and courteous language, urged him to
yield to the exigencies of the time, and not to forsake so many churches on account of a
petty nicety of doctrine. He moreover promised him the friendship of the emperor, and
pointed out that through it he might be the means of conferring great advantages upon
many. “This sort of talk,” said the divine man, “is fitted for little boys, for they and their like
easily swallow such inducements. But they who are nurtured by divine words will not suffer
so much as a syllable of the divine creeds to be let go, and for their sake are ready, should
need require, to embrace every kind of death. The emperor’s friendship I hold to be of great
value if conjoined with true religion; otherwise I doom it for a deadly thing.”</p>
<p>Then the prefect was moved to wrath, and declared that Basil was out of his senses.
“But,” said the divine man, “this madness I pray be ever mine.” The bishop was then ordered
to retire, to deliberate on the course to be pursued, and on the morrow to declare to what
conclusion he had come. Intimidation was moreover joined with argument. The reply of
the illustrious bishop is related to have been “I for my part shall come to you tomorrow the
same man that I am today; do not yourself change, but carry out your threats.” After these
discussions the prefect met the emperor and reported the conversation, pointing out the
bishop’s virtue, and the undaunted manliness of his character. The emperor said nothing
and passed in. In his palace he saw that plagues from heaven had fallen, for his son724 lay
sick at the very gates of death and his wife725 was beset by many ailments. Then he recognised
<note type="footnote">723 Cæsarea Ad Argæum (now Kasaria) at the foot of Mount Argæus, was made a Roman province by

the cause of these sorrows, and entreated the divine man, whom he had threatened with
chastisement, to come to his house. His officers performed the imperial behests and then
the great Basil came to the palace.</p>
<p>After seeing the emperor’s son on the point of death he promised him restoration to
life if he should receive holy baptism at the hands of the pious, and with this pledge went
his way. But the emperor, like the foolish Herod, remembered his oath, and ordered some
of the Arian faction who were present to baptize the boy, who immediately died. Then
Valens repented; he saw how fraught with danger the keeping of his oath had been, and
came to the divine temple and received the teaching of the great Basil, and offered the customary
gifts at the altar. The bishop moreover ordered him to come within the divine curtains
where he sat and talked much with him about the divine decrees and in turn listened to
him.</p>
<p>Now there was present a certain man of the name of Demosthenes,726 superintendent
of the imperial kitchen, who in rudely chiding the man who instructed the world was guilty
of a solecism of speech. Basil smiled and said “we see here an illiterate Demosthenes;” and
on Demosthenes losing his temper and uttering threats, he continued “your business is to
attend to the seasoning of soups; you cannot understand theology because your ears are
stopped up.” So he said, and the emperor was so delighted that he gave him some fine lands
which he had there for the poor under his care, for they being in grievous bodily affliction
were specially in need of care and cure.</p>
<p>In this manner then the great Basil avoided the emperor’s first attack, but when he came
a second time his better judgement was obstructed by counsellors who deceived him; he
forgot what had happened on the former occasion and ordered Basil to go over to the hostile
faction, and, failing to persuade him, commanded the decree of exile to be enforced. But
when he tried to affix his signature to it he could not even form one tittle of a word,727 for
the pen broke, and when the same thing happened to the second and to the third pen, and
he still strove to sign that wicked edict, his hand shook; he quaked, his soul was filled with
fright; he tore the paper with both his hands, and so proof was given by the Ruler of the
world that it was He Himself who had permitted these sufferings to be undergone by the
<note type="footnote">726 If this Demosthenes “is the same person with the Demosthenes who four years later held the office of
vicar of Pontus we have in him one of the many examples presented by the history of the Eastern empire of the

chief cook may have been a high functionary like the chief baker at the court of the Pharaohs or the Lord High
Steward at that of St. James’s. Of the elevation of a menial to power many parallels may be found. Demosthenes
of Pontus afterwards became a partisan of the Semi-arians and accused Basil’s brother, Gregory of Nyssa, of
dishonesty. Basil. Epist. 264, 385, 405.</note>

rest, but had made Basil stronger than the snares laid against him, and, by all the incidents
of Basil’s case, had declared His own almighty power, while on the other hand He had proclaimed
abroad the courage of good men. Thus Valens was disappointed in his attack.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Of the death of the great Athanasius and the election of Petrus.</head>
<p>At Alexandria, Athanasius the victorious, after all his struggles, each rewarded with a
crown, received release from his labours and passed away to the life which knows no toil.
Then Peter, a right excellent man, received the see. His blessed predecessor had first selected
him, and every suffrage alike of the clergy and of men of rank and office concurred, and all
the people strove to show their delight by their acclamations. He had shared the heavy labours
of Athanasius; at home and abroad he had been ever at his side, and with him had undergone
manifold perils. Wherefore the bishops of the neighbourhood hastened to meet; and those
who dwelt in schools of ascetic discipline left them and joined the company, and all joined
in begging that Peter might be chosen to succeed to the patriarchal chair of Athanasius.728</p>
<note type="footnote">728 “The discussions about the year of his death may be considered as practically closed; the Festal Index,
although its chronology is sometimes faulty, confirming the date of 373, given in the Maffeian fragment. The

Western Church. He had sat on the Alexandrian throne forty-six complete years. He died tranquilly in his own

<head>Chapter XVIII.—On the overthrow of Petrus and the introduction of Lucius the Arian.</head>
<p>No sooner had they seated him on the episcopal throne than the governor of the province
assembled a mob of Greeks and Jews, surrounded the walls of the church,729 and bade Peter
come forth, threatening him with exile if he refused. He thus acted on the plea that he was
fulfilling the emperor’s good pleasure by bringing those of opposite sentiments into trouble,
but the truth was that he was carried away by his impious passion. For he was addicted to
the service of the idols, and looked upon the storms which beset the Church as a season of
brilliant festivity. The admirable Peter, however, when he beheld the unforeseen conflict,
secretly withdrew, and embarked in a vessel bound for Rome.</p>
<p>After a few days Euzoius came from Antioch with Lucius, and handed over the churches
to him. This was he of whose impiety and lawlessness Samosata had already had experience.
But the people nurtured in the teaching of Athanasius, when they now saw how different
was the spiritual food offered them, held aloof from the assemblies of the Church.</p>
<p>Lucius, who employed idolators as his attendants, went on scourging some, imprisoning
others; some he drove to take to flight, others’ homes he rifled in rude and cruel fashion.
But all this is better set forth in the letter of the admirable Peter. After recounting an instance
of the impious conduct of Lucius I shall insert the letter in this work.</p>
<p>Certain men in Egypt, of angelic life and conversation, fled from the disquiet of the state
and chose to live in solitude in the wilderness. There they made the sandy and barren soil
bear fruit; for a fruit right sweet and fair to God was the virtue by whose law they lived.
Among many who took the lead in this mode of life was the far-famed Antonius, most excellent
master in the school of mortification, who made the desert a training place of virtue
for his hermits. He after all his great and glorious labours had reached the haven where the
winds of trouble blow no more, and then his followers were persecuted by the wretched and
unhappy Lucius. All the leaders of those divine companies, the famous Macarius, his
namesake, Isidorus, and the rest730 were dragged out of their caves and despatched to a
certain island inhabited by impious men, and never blessed with any teacher of piety. When
<note type="footnote">729 The church Theonas, where Syrianus nearly seized Athanasius in 356.</note>
<note type="footnote">730 There are traces of some confusion about the saints and solitaries of this name at this period. “There were
two hermits or monks of this name both of the 4th c., both living in Egypt, whose character and deeds are almost
indistinguishable.” “One of them is said to have been the disciple of Anthony, and the master of Evagrius.” “The
name of Macarius, like a double star, shines as a central light in the monkish history, and is enshrined alike in
the Roman martyrologies, and in the legends of the Greek church. Macarius is a favourite saint in Russia.”
(Canon Fremantle, Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 774.) cf. Soc. iv. 23. In iv. 24 Soc. describes both the Macarii as banished
to the island “which had not a single Christian inhabitant.” Sozomen (vi. 20) has the same story. There was an
Isidorus, bishop of Cyrus in 378, mentioned by Theodoretus in his Religious History (1143), and an Isidorus, bishop of
Athribis in Egypt. cf. Dict. Christ. Biog. s.v. But the Isidorus of the text appears to have been a monk.</note>

the ship drew near to the shore of the island the demon reverenced by its inhabitants departed
from the image which had been his time-old home, and filled with frenzy the daughter of
the priest. She was driven in her inspired fury to the shore where the rowers were bringing
the ship to land. Making the tongue of the girl his instrument, the demon shouted out
through her the words uttered at Philippi by the woman possessed with the spirit of Python,
731 and was heard by all, both men and women, saying, “Alas for your power, ye servants
of the Christ; everywhere we have been driven forth by you from town and hamlet, from
hill and height, from wastes where no men dwell; in yon islet we had hoped to live out of
the reach of your shafts, but our hope was vain; hither you have been sent by your persecutors,
not to be harmed by them, but to drive us out. We are quitting the island, for we are being
wounded by the piercing rays of your virtue.” With these words, and words like these, they
dashed the damsel to the ground, and themselves all fled together. But that divine company
prayed over the girl and raised her up, and delivered her to her father made whole and in
her right mind.</p>
<p>The spectators of the miracle flung themselves at the feet of the new comers and implored
to be allowed to participate in the means of salvation. They destroyed the idol’s grove, and,
illuminated by the bright rays of instruction, received the grace of holy baptism. On these
events becoming known in Alexandria all the people met together, reviling Lucius, and
saying that wrath from God would fall upon them, were not that divine company of saints
to be set free. Then Lucius, apprehensive of a tumult in the city, suffered the holy hermits
to go back to their dens. Let this suffice to give a specimen of his impious iniquity. The sinful
deeds he dared to do will be more clearly set forth by the letter of the admirable Peter. I
hesitate to insert it at full length, and so will only quote some extracts from it.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Narrative of events at Alexandria in the time of Lucius the Arian, taken from
a letter of Petrus, Bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>Palladius governor of the province, by sect a heathen,732 and one who habitually prostrated
himself before the idols, had frequently entertained the thought of waging war against
Christ. After collecting the forces already enumerated he set out against the Church, as
though he were pressing forward to the subjugation of a foreign foe. Then, as is well known,
the most shocking deeds were done, and at the bare thought of telling the story, its recollec-
tion fills me with anguish. I have shed floods of tears, and I should have long remained thus
bitterly affected had I not assuaged my grief by divine meditation. The crowds intruded into
the church called Theonas733 and there instead of holy words were uttered the praises of
idols; there where the Holy Scriptures had been read might be heard unseemly clapping of
hands with unmanly and indecent utterances; there outrages were offered to the Virgins of
Christ which the tongue refuses to utter, for “it is a shame even to speak of them.”734 On
only hearing of these wrongs one of the well disposed stopped his ears and prayed that he
might rather become deaf than have to listen to their foul language. Would that they had
been content to sin in word alone, and had not surpassed the wickedness of word by deed,
for insult, however bad it be, can be borne by them in whom dwells Christ’s wisdom and
His holy lessons. But these same villains, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,735 screwed
up their noses and poured out, if I may so say, as from a well-head, foul noises through their
nostrils, and rent the raiment from Christ’s holy virgins, whose conversation gave an exact
likeness of saints; they dragged them in triumph, naked as when they were born, through
all the town; they made indecent sport of them at their pleasure; their deeds were barbarous
and cruel. Did any one in pity interfere and urge to mercy he was dismissed with wounds.
Ah! woe is me. Many a virgin underwent brutal violation; many a maid beaten on the head,
with clubs lay dumb, and even their bodies were not allowed to be given up for burial, and
their grief-stricken parents cannot find their corpses to this day. But why recount woes
which seem small when compared with greater? Why linger over these and not hurry on to
events more urgent? When you hear them I know that you will wonder and will stand with
us long dumb, amazed at the kindness of the Lord in not bringing all things utterly to an

end. At the very altar the impious perpetrated what, as it is written,736 neither happened
nor was heard of in the days of our fathers.</p>
<p>A boy who had forsworn his sex and would pass for a girl, with eyes, as it is written,
smeared with antimony,737 and face reddened with rouge like their idols, in woman’s dress,
was set up to dance and wave his hands about and whirl round as though he had been at
the front of some disreputable stage, on the holy altar itself where we call on the coming of
the Holy Ghost, while the by-standers laughed aloud and rudely raised unseemly shouts.
But as this seemed to them really rather decorous than improper, they went on to proceedings
which they reckoned in accordance with their indecency; they picked out a man who was
very famous for utter baseness, made him strip off at once all his clothes and all his shame,
and set him up as naked as he was born on the throne of the church, and dubbed him a vile
advocate against Christ. Then for divine words he uttered shameless wickedness, for awful
doctrines wanton lewdness, for piety impiety, for continence fornication, adultery, foul lust,
theft; teaching that gluttony and drunkenness as well as all the rest were good for man’s
life.738 In this state of things when even I had withdrawn from the church739—for how
could I remain where troops were coming in—where a mob was bribed to violence—where
all were striving for gain—where mobs of heathen were making mighty promises?—forth,
forsooth, is sent a successor in my place. It was one named Lucius, who had bought the
bishopric as he might some dignity of this world, eager to maintain the bad character and
conduct of a wolf.740 No synod of orthodox bishops had chosen him;741 no vote of genuine

escorted not by bishops, not by presbyters, not by deacons, not by multitudes of
the laity; no monks preceded him chanting psalms from the Scriptures; but there was Euzoius,
once a deacon of our city of Alexandria, and long since degraded along with Arius in the
great and holy synod of Nicæa, and more recently raised to rule and ravage the see of Antioch,
and there, too, was Magnus the treasurer,742 notorious for every kind of impiety, leading a

vast body of troops. In the reign of Julian this Magnus had burnt the church at Berytus,743
the famous city of Phoenicia; and, in the reign of Jovian of blessed memory, after barely escaping
decapitation by numerous appeals to the imperial compassion, had been compelled
to build it up again at his own expense.</p>
<p>Now I invoke your zeal to rise in our vindication. From what I write you ought to be
able to calculate the character and extent of the wrongs committed against the Church of
God by the starting up of this Lucius to oppose us. Often rejected by your piety and by the
orthodox bishops of every region, he seized on a city which had just and righteous cause to
regard and treat him as a foe. For he does not merely say like the blasphemous fool in the
psalms “Christ is not true God.”744 But, corrupt himself, he corrupted others, rejoicing in
the blasphemies uttered continually against the Saviour by them who worshipped the creature
instead of the Creator. The scoundrel’s opinions being quite on a par with those of a heathen,
why should he not venture to worship a new-made God, for these were the phrases with
which he was publicly greeted “Welcome, bishop, because thou deniest the Son. Serapis
loves thee and has brought thee to us.” So they named their native idol. Then without an
interval of delay the afore-named Magnus, inseparable associate in the villainy of Lucius,
cruel body-guard, savage lieutenant, collected together all the multitudes committed to his
care, and arrested presbyters and deacons to the number of nineteen, some of whom were
eighty years of age, on the charge of being concerned in some foul violation of Roman law.
He constituted a public tribunal, and, in ignorance of the laws of Christians in defence of
virtue, endeavoured to compel them to give up the faith of their fathers which had been
handed down from the apostles through the fathers to us. He even went so far as to maintain
that this would be gratifying to the most merciful and clement Valens Augustus. “Wretched
man” he shouted “accept, accept the doctrine of the Arians; God will pardon you even
though you worship with a true worship, if you do this not of your own accord but because
you are compelled. There is always a defence for irresponsible compulsion, while free action
is responsible and much followed by accusation. Consider well these arguments; come
willingly; away with all delay; subscribe the doctrine of Arius preached now by Lucius,” (so
he introduced him by name) “being well assured that if you obey you will have wealth and
honour from your prince, while if you refuse you will be punished by chains, rack, torture,

scourge and cruel torments; you will be deprived of your property and possessions; you will
be driven into exile and condemned to dwell in savage regions.”</p>
<p>Thus this noble character mixed intimidation with deceit and so endeavoured to persuade
and compel the people to apostatise from true religion. They however knew full well how
true it is that the pain of treachery to right religion is sharper than any torment; they refused
to lower their virtue and noble spirit to his trickery and threats, and were thus constrained
to answer him. “Cease, cease trying to frighten us with these words, utter no more vain
words. We worship no God of late arrival or of new invention. Foam at us if you will in the
vain tempest of your fury and dash yourselves against us like a furious wind. We abide by
the doctrines of true religion even unto death; we have never regarded God as impotent, or
as unwise, or untrue, as at one time a Father and at another not a Father, as this impious
Arian teaches, making the Son a being of time and transitory. For if, as the Ariomaniacs
say, the Son is a creature, not being naturally of one substance with the Father, the Father
too will be reduced to non-existence by the nonexistence of the Son, not being as they assert
at one period a Father. But if He is ever a Father, his offspring being truly of Him, and not
by derivation, for God is impassible, how is not he mad and foolish who says of the Son
through whom all things came by grace into existence, “there was a time when he was not.”</p>
<p>These men have truly become fatherless by falling away from our fathers throughout
the world who assembled at Nicæa, and anathematized the false doctrine of Arius, now defended
by this later champion. They laid down that the Son was not as you are now compelling
us to say, of a different substance from the Father, but of one and the same. This their
pious intelligence clearly perceived, and so from an adequate collation of divine terms they
owned Him to be consubstantial.</p>
<p>Advancing these and other similar arguments, they were imprisoned for many days in
the hope that they might be induced to fall away from their right mind, but the rather, like
the noblest of the athletes in a Stadium, they crushed all fear, and from time to time as it
were anointing themselves with the thought of the bold deeds done by their fathers, through
the help of holy thoughts maintained a nobler constancy in piety, and treated the rack as a
training place for virtue. While they were thus struggling, and had become, as writes the
blessed Paul, a spectacle to angels and to men,745 the whole city ran up to gaze at Christ’s
athletes, vanquishing by stout endurance the scourges of the judge who was torturing them,
winning by patience trophies against impiety, and exhibiting triumphs against Arians. So
their savage enemy thought that by threats and torments he could subdue and deliver them
to the enemies of Christ. Thus therefore the savage and inhuman tyrant evilly entreated
them by inflicting on them the tortures that his cruel ingenuity devised, while all the people
stood wailing and shewing their sorrow in various ways. Then he once more mustered his

troops, who were disciplined in disorder, and summoned the martyrs to trial, or as it might
rather be called, to a foregone condemnation, by the seaport, while after their fashion hired
cries were raised against them by the idolaters and the Jews. On their refusal to yield to the
manifest heresy of the Ariomaniacs they were sentenced, while all the people stood in tears
before the tribunal, to be deported from Alexandria to the Phoenician Heliopolis,746 a place
where none of the inhabitants, who are all given over to idols, can endure so much as to
hear the name of Christ.</p>
<p>After giving them the order to embark, Magnus stationed himself at the port, for he had
delivered his sentence against them in the neighbourhood of the public baths. He showed
them his sword unsheathed, thinking that he could thus strike terror into men who had
again and again smitten hostile demons to the ground with their two-edged blade. So he
bade them put out to sea, though they had got no provisions on board, and were starting
without one single comfort for their exile. Strange and almost incredible to relate, the sea
was all afoam; grieved, I think, and unwilling, if I may so say, to receive the good men upon
its surface, and so have part or lot in an unrighteous sentence. Now even to the ignorant
was made manifest the savage purpose of the judge and it may truly be said “at this, the
heavens stood astonished.”747</p>
<p>The whole city groaned, and is lamenting to this day. Some men beating on their breast
with one hand after another raised a mighty noise; others lifted up at once their hands and
eyes to heaven in testimony of the wrong inflicted on them, and so saying in all but words,
“Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,”748 what unlawful deeds are being done. Now all
was weeping and wailing; singing and sighing sounded through all the town, and from every
eye flowed a river of tears which threatened to overwhelm the very sea with its tide. There
was the aforesaid Magnus on the port ordering the rowers to hoist the sails, and up went a
mingled cry of maids and matrons, old men and young, all sobbing and lamenting together,
and the noise of the multitude overwhelmed the roar raised by the waves on the foaming
sea. So the martyrs sailed off for Heliopolis, where every man is given over to superstition,749
where flourish the devil’s ways of pleasure, and where the situation of the city, surrounded
on all sides by mountains that approach the sky, is fitted for the terrifying lairs of wild beasts.
All the friends they left behind now alike in public in the middle of the town and each in
private apart groaned and uttered words of grief, and were even forbidden to weep, at the
order of Palladius, prefect of the city, who happened himself to be a man quite given over

to superstition. Many of the mourners were first arrested and thrown into prison, and then
scourged, torn with carding combs, tortured, and, champions as they were of the church in
their holy enthusiasm, were despatched to the mines of Phennesus750 and Proconnesus.751</p>
<p>Most of them were monks, devoted to a life of ascetic solitude, and were about twentythree
in number. Not long afterwards the deacon who had been sent by our beloved Damasus,
bishop of Rome, to bring us letters of consolation and communion, was led publicly
through the town by executioners, with his hands tied behind his back like some notorious
criminal. After sharing the tortures inflicted on murderers, he was terribly scourged with
stones and bits of lead about his very neck.752 He went on board ship to sail, like the rest,
with the mark of the sacred cross upon his brow; with none to aid and none to tempt him
he was despatched to the copper mines of Phennesus. During the tortures inflicted by the
magistrate on the tender bodies of little boys, some have been left lying on the spot deprived
of holy rites of burial, though parents and brothers and kinsfolk, and indeed the whole city,
begged that this one consolation might be given them. But alas for the inhumanity of the
judge, if indeed he can be called judge who only condemns! They who had contended nobly
for the true religion were assigned a worse fate than a murderer’s, their bodies lying, as they
did, unburied. The glorious champions were thrown to be devoured by beasts and birds of
prey.753 Those who were anxious for conscience’ sake to express sympathy with the parents
were punished by decapitation, as though they had broken some law. What Roman law, nay
what foreign sentiment, ever inflicted punishment for the expression of sympathy with
parents? What instance is there of the perpetration of so illegal a deed by any one of the
ancients? The male children of the Hebrews were indeed once ordered to be slain by Pharaoh,
but his edict was suggested by envy and by fear. How far greater the inhumanity of our day
than of his. How preferable, if there be a choice in unrighteousness, their wrongs to ours.
How much better; if what is illegal can be called good or bad, though in truth iniquity is always
iniquity.</p>

the whole city was lamenting; for, as it is written in Exodus, “there was not a house in which
there was not one dead.”754</p>
<p>The men whose appetite for iniquity was never satisfied planned new agitation. Ever
wreaking their evil will in evil deeds, they darted the peculiar venom of their iniquity at the
bishops of the province, using the aforesaid treasurer Magnus as the instrument of their
unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Some they delivered to the Senate, some they trapped at their good pleasure, leaving no
stone unturned in their anxiety to hunt in all from every quarter to impiety, going about in
all directions, and like the devil, the proper father of heresy, they sought whom they might
devour.755</p>
<p>In all, after many fruitless efforts, they drove into exile to Dio-Cæsarea,756 a city inhabited
by Jews, murderers of the Lord, eleven of the bishops of Egypt, all of them men who from
childhood to old age had lived an ascetic life in the desert, had subdued their inclinations
to pleasure by reason and by discipline, had fearlessly preached the true faith of piety, had
imbibed the pious doctrines, had again and again won victory against demons, were ever
putting the adversary out of countenance by their virtue, and publicly posting the Arian
heresy by wisest argument. Yet like Hell,757 not satisfied with the death of their brethren,
fools and madmen as they were, eager to win a reputation by their evil deeds, they tried to
leave memorials in all the world of their own cruelty. For lo now they roused the imperial
attention against certain clerics of the catholic church who were living at Antioch, together
with some excellent monks who came forward to testify against their evil deeds. They got
these men banished to Neocæsarea758 in Pontus, where they were soon deprived of life in
consequence of the sterility of the country. Such tragedies were enacted at this period, fit
indeed to be consigned to silence and oblivion, but given a place in history for the condemnation
of the men who wag their tongues against the Only begotten, and infected as they
were with the raving madness of blasphemy, strive not only to aim their shafts at the Master
of the universe, but further waged a truceless war against His faithful servants.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Of Mavia,759 Queen of the Saracens, and the ordination760of Moses the monk.</head>
<p>At this time761 the Ishmaelites were devastating the country in the neighbourhood of
the Roman frontier. They were led by Mavia, a princess who regarded not the sex which
nature had given her, and displayed the spirit and courage of a man. After many engagements
she made a truce, and, on receiving the light of divine knowledge, begged that to the dignity
of high priest of her tribe might be advanced one, Moses by name, who dwelt on the confines
of Egypt and Palestine. This request Valens granted, and ordered the holy man to be conveyed
to Alexandria, and there, as the most convenient place in the neighbourhood, to receive
episcopal grace. When he had arrived and saw Lucius endeavouring to lay hands on
him—“God forbid” said he “that I should be ordained by thine hand: the grace of the Spirit
visits us not at thy calling.” “Whence,” said Lucius, “are you led to conjecture this?” He rejoined
“I am not speaking of conjecture but of clear knowledge; for thou fightest against the
apostolic decrees, and speakest words against them, and for thy blasphemous utterances
thy lawless deeds are a match. For what impious man has not on thy account mocked the
meetings of the Church? What excellent man has not been exiled? What barbarous savagery
is not thrown into the shade by thy daily deeds?” So the brave man said, and the murderer
<note type="footnote">759 cf. Soz. vi. 38, and Soc. iv. 36.</note>
<note type="footnote">760 The word used is χειροτονία, of which it is well to trace the varying usages. These are given by the late
Rev. E. Hatch (Dict. Christ. Ant. ii. 1501) as follows. “This word is used (a) in the N.T. Acts xiv. 24,
χειροτονήσαντες δὲ αὐτοῖς κατ᾽ ἐκκλησίαν πρεσβυτέρους: 2 Cor. viii. 19 (of Titus) χειροτονηθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν
ἐκκλησιῶν; (b) in sub-apostolic Greek, Ignat. ad Philad. c. 10; (c) in the Clementines, Clement. Ep. ad Jacob. c.
2; (d) in the Apostolical Constitution; (e) in the Canon Law; (f) in the Civil Law. Its meaning was originally “to
elect,” but it came afterwards to mean even in classical Greek, simply “to appoint to office,” without itself indicating
the particular mode of appointment (cf. Schömann de Comitüs, p. 122). That the latter was its ordinary
meaning in Hellenistic Greek, and consequently in the first ages of church history, is clear from a large number
of instances; e.g. in Josephus vi. 13, 9, it is used of the appointment of David as King by God; id. xiii, 22, of the
appointment of Jonathan as High Priest by Alexander; in Philo ii, 76 it is used of the appointment of Joseph as
governor by Pharaoh; in Lucian, de morte Peregrini c. 41 of the appointment of ambassadors. “In Sozomen vii,
24 of the appointment of Arcadius as Augustus by Theodosius.” “In later times a new connotation appears of
which there is no early trace; it was used of the stretching out of the bishop’s hands in the rite of imposition of
hands.” The writer of the above seems hardly to do justice to its early use for ordination as well as for appointment.
In the Pseudo-Ig. ad. Her. c. iii, it is said of bishops ἐκεῖνοι χειροτονοῦσι, χειροθετοῦσι and Bp. Lightfoot
comments “while χειροθεσία is used of laying on of hands, e.g. in confirmation, χειροτονία is said of ordination,
e.g. Ap. Const. viii. 27. ‘ἐπίσκοπος ὑπὸ τριῶν ἢ δύο ἐπισκόπων χειροτονεῖσθω.’ Referring originally to the
election of the Clergy χειροτονία came afterwards to be applied commonly, as here, to their ordination.”
Theodoretus uses the word in both senses, and sometimes either will fit in with the context.</note>

heard him and desired to slay him, but was afraid of kindling once again the war which had
come to an end. Wherefore he ordered other bishops to be produced whom Moses had requested.
After receiving the episcopal grace of the right worthy faith Moses returned to the
people who had asked for him, and by his apostolic teaching and miracles led them in the
way that leads to truth.762</p>
<p>These then were the deeds done by Lucius in Alexandria under the dispensation of the
providence of God.</p>
<note type="footnote">762 Sozomen (vi. 38) describes Lucius as remonstrating in moderate language. “Do not judge of me before
you know what my creed is.” Socrates (iv. 36) makes Moses charge Lucius with condemning the orthodox to
exile, beasts, and burning. On Socrates Valesius annotates “Hanc narrationem de episcopo Saracenis dato et de
pace cum iisdem facta, desumpsit quidem Socrates, ex Rufini lib. ii. 6.” Lucius was ejected from Alexandria
when the reign of Valens ended with his death in 378. Theodoretus appears to confound this Lucius with an
Arian Lucius who usurped the see of Samosata. Vide chap. xviii.</note>

<p>At Constantinople the Arians filled a boat with pious presbyters and drove her without
ballast out to sea, putting some of their own men on another craft with orders to set the
presbyters boat on fire. So, fighting at the same time against both sea and flames, at last they
were delivered to the deep, and won the martyrs crown.</p>
<p>At Antioch Valens spent a considerable time, and gave complete license to all who,
under cover of the Christian name, pagans, Jews and the rest, preached doctrines contrary
to those of the gospel. The slaves of this error even went so far as to perform pagan rites,
and thus the deceitful fire which, after Julian, had been quenched by Jovian, was now rekindled
by permission of Valens. The rites of Jews, of Dionysus, and of Demeter were now
no longer performed in a corner, as they would be in a pious reign, but by revellers running
wild in the forum. Valens was a foe to none but them that held the apostolic doctrine. First
he drove them from their churches, the illustrious Jovian having given them also the new
built church. And when they assembled close up to the mountain cliff to honour their
Master in hymns, and enjoy the word of God, putting up with all the assaults of the weather,
now of rain, now of snow and cold, and now of violent heat, they were not even suffered
this poor protection, and troops were sent to scatter them far and wide.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—How Flavianus and Diodorus gathered the church of the orthodox in Antioch.</head>
<p>Now Flavianus and Diodorus, like break-waters, broke the force of the advancing waves.
Meletius their shepherd had been constrained to sojourn far away. But these looked after
the flock, opposing their own courage and cunning to the wolves, and bestowing due care
upon the sheep. Now that they were driven away from under the cliff they fed their flocks
by the banks of the neighbouring river. They could not brook, like the captives at Babylon,
to hang their harps upon the willows,764 but they continued to hymn their maker and benefactor
in all places of his dominion.765 But not even in this spot was the meeting of the pious
pastors of them that blessed the Lord suffered by the foe to be assembled. So again this pair
of excellent shepherds gathered their sheep in the soldiers training ground and there tried
to show them their spiritual food in secret. Diodorus, in his wisdom and courage, like a
clear and mighty river, watered his own and drowned the blasphemies of his opponents,
thinking nothing of the splendour of his birth, and gladly undergoing the sufferings of the
faith.</p>
<p>The excellent Flavianus, who was also of the highest rank, thought piety the only nobility,
766 and, like some trainer for the games, anointed the great Diodorus767 as though he
had been an athlete for five contests.768</p>
<p>At that time he did not himself preach at the services of the church, but furnished an
abundant supply of arguments and scriptural thoughts to preachers, who were thus able to
aim their shafts at the blasphemy of Arius, while he as it were handed them the arrows of
his intelligence from a quiver. Discoursing alike at home and abroad he easily rent asunder
the heretics nets and showed their defences to be mere spiders webs. He was aided in these
contests by that Aphraates whose life I have written in my Religious History,769 and who,
preferring the welfare of the sheep to his own rest, abandoned his cell of discipline and retirement,
and undertook the hard toil of a shepherd. Having written on these matters in
another work I deem it now superfluous to recount the wealth of virtue which he amassed,

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Of the holy monk Aphraates.</head>
<p>On the north of the river Orontes lies the palace. On the South a vast two storied portico
is built on the city wall with lofty towers on either side. Between the palace and the river lies
a public way open to passengers from the town, through the gate in this quarter, and leading
to the country in the suburbs. The godly Aphraates was once passing along this thoroughfare
on his way to the soldiers’ training ground, in order to perform the duty of serving his flock.
The emperor happened to be looking down from a gallery in the palace, and saw him going
by wearing a cloak of undressed goat’s skin,770 and walking rapidly, though of advanced
age. On its being remarked that this was Aphraates to whom all the town was then attached,
the emperor cried out “Where are you going? Tell us.” Readily and cleverly he answered
“To pray for your empire.” “You had better stop at home” said the emperor “and pray alone
like a monk.” “Yes,” said the divine man, “so I was bound to do and so I always did till now,
as long as the Saviour’s sheep were at peace; but now that they are grievously disturbed and
in great peril of being caught by beasts, I needs must leave no means untried to save the
nurslings. For tell me, sir, had I been a girl sitting in my chamber, and looking after the
house, and had seen a flash of flame fall and my father’s house on fire, what ought I to do?
Tell me; sit within and never mind the house being on fire, and wait for the flame to approach?
or bid my bower good bye and run up and down and get water and try to quench
the flame? Of course you will say the latter, for so a quick and spirited girl would do. And
that is what I am doing now, sir. You have set fire to our Father’s house and we are running
about in the endeavour to put it out.” So said Aphraates, and the emperor threatened him
and said no more. One of the grooms of the imperial bedchamber, who threatened the godly
man somewhat more violently, met with the following fate. He was entrusted with the charge
of the bath, and immediately after this conversation he came down to get it ready for the
emperor. On entering he lost his wits, stepped into the boiling water before it was mixed
with the cold, and so met his end. The emperor sat waiting for him to announce that the
bath was ready for him to enter, and after a considerable time had gone by he sent other
officers to report the cause of the delay. After they had gone in and looked all about the
room they discovered the chamberlain slain by the heat, and lying dead in the boiling water.
On this becoming known to the emperor they perceived the force of the prayers of Aphraates.
Nevertheless they did not depart from the impious doctrines but hardened their heart like
Pharaoh, and the infatuated emperor, though made aware of the miracle of the holy man,
persisted in his mad rage against piety.</p>

faction, those lights of the truth Flavianus, Diodorus, and Aphraates sent Acacius,771 an

with the entreaty that he would take pity on so many thousands of men, and at the
same time convict the enemy of lies and confirm the proclamation of the truth. The miracles
worked by Julianus on his way to and from Antioch and in that vast city itself are described
in my Religious History, which is easily accessible to all who wish to become acquainted
with them. But I am sure that no one who has enquired into human nature will doubt that
he attracted all the population of the city to our assembly, for the extraordinary is generally
sure to draw all men after it. The fact of his having wrought great marvels is attested even
by the enemies of the truth.</p>
<p>Before this time in the reign of Constantius the great Antonius773 had acted in the same
way in Alexandria, for he abandoned the desert and went up and down that city, telling all
men that Athanasius was the preacher of the true doctrine and that the Arian faction were
enemies of the truth. So those godly men knew how to adapt themselves to each particular
opportunity, when to remain inactive, and at rest, and when to leave the deserts for towns.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Of what other monks were distinguished at this period.</head>
<p>There were also other men at this period who emitted the bright rays of the philosophy
of solitary life. In the Chalcidian774 desert Avitus, Marcianus775 and Abraames,776 and
more besides whom I cannot easily enumerate, strove in their bodies of sense to live a life
superior to sense. In the district of Apamea,777 Agapetus,778 Simeon,779 Paulus and others
reaped the fruits of the highest wisdom.</p>
<p>In the district of the Zeugmatenses780 were Publius781 and Paulus. In the Cyrestian782
the famous Acepsemas had been shut up in a cell for sixty years without being either seen
or spoken to. The admirable Zeumatius, though bereft of sight, used to go about confirming
the sheep, and fighting with the wolves; so they burnt his cell, but the right faithful general
Trajanus got another built for him, and paid him besides other attentions. In the neighbourhood
of Antioch, Marianus,783 Eusebius,784 Ammianus,785 Palladius,786 Simeon,787 Abraames,
788 and others, preserved the divine image unimpaired; but of all these the lives have

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Of Didymus of Alexandria and Ephraim the Syrian.</head>
<p>At that period at Edessa flourished the admirable Ephraim, and at Alexandria
Didymus,792 both writers against the doctrines that are at variance with the truth. Ephraim,
employing the Syrian language, shed beams of spiritual grace. Totally untainted as he was
by heathen education793 he was able to expose the niceties of heathen error, and lay bare
the weakness of all heretical artifices. Harmonius794 the son of Bardesanes795 had once
composed certain songs and by mixing sweetness of melody with his impiety beguiled the
hearers, and led them to their destruction. Ephraim adopted the music of the songs, but set
them to piety, and so gave the hearers at once great delight and a healing medicine. These
songs are still used to enliven the festivals of our victorious martyrs.</p>
<p>Didymus, however, who from a child had been deprived of the sense of sight, had been
educated in poetry, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, the logic of Aristotle, and
the eloquence of Plato. Instruction in all these subjects he received by the sense of hearing
alone,—not indeed as conveying the truth, but as likely to be weapons for the truth against
falsehood. Of holy scriptures he learnt not only the sound but the sense. So among livers of
ascetic lives and students of virtue, these men at that time were conspicuous.</p>
<note type="footnote">792 Flourished c. 309–399. Blind from the age of four, he educated himself with marvellous patience, and
was placed by Athanasius at the head of the catechetical school of Alexandria. Jerome called him his teacher

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Of what bishops were at this time distinguished in Asia and Pontus.</head>
<p>Among the bishops were the two Gregorii, the one of Nazianzus796 and the other of
Nyssa,797 the latter the brother and the former the friend and fellow worker of the great
Basilius. These were foremost champions of piety in Cappadocia; and in front rank with
them was Peter, born of the same parents with Basilius and Gregorius, who though not
having received like them a foreign education, like them lived a life of brilliant distinction.</p>
<p>In Pisidia Optimus,798 in Lycaonia Amphilochius,799 fought in the front rank on behalf
of their fathers’ faith, and repelled the enemies’ assaults.</p>
<p>In the West Damasus,800 Bishop of Rome, and Ambrosius, entrusted with the government
of Milan, smote those who attacked them from afar. In conjunction with these, bishops
forced to dwell in remote regions, confirmed their friends and undid their foes by writings—
thus pilots able to cope with the greatness of the storm were granted by the governor
of the universe. Against the violence of the foe He set in battle array the virtue of His captains,
and provided means meet to ward off the troubles of these difficult times, and not only were
the churches granted this kind of protection by their loving Lord, but deemed worthy of yet
another kind of guidance.</p>
<note type="footnote">796 Gregorius of Nazianzus (in Cappadocia, on the Halys) was so called not as bishop of Nazianzus. He was
bishop successively of Sasima, “a detestable little village,”—(Carm. xi. 439–446)—and of Constantinople, and
was called “Nazianzenus” because his father and namesake was bishop of that see. On his acting as bishop at

<p>The Lord roused the Goths to war, and drew on to the Bosphorus him who knew only
how to fight against the pious. Then for the first time the vain man became aware of his
own weakness, and sent to his brother to ask for troops. But Valentinian replied that it were
impious to help one fighting against God, and right rather to check his rashness. By this the
unhappy man was filled with yet greater infatuation, yet he did not withdraw from his rash
undertaking, and persisted in ranging himself against the truth.801</p>

<p>Terentius, an excellent general, distinguished for his piety, had set up trophies of victory

one which it was becoming in a man nurtured in piety to choose, for he asked not gold nor
yet silver, not land, not dignity, not a house, but that one church might be granted to them
that were risking their all for the Apostolic doctrine. Valens received the petition, but on
becoming acquainted with its contents he tore it up in a rage, and bade Terentius beg some
other boon. The count, however, picked up the pieces of his petition, and said, “I have my
reward, sir, and I will not ask another. The Judge of all things is Judge of my intention.”</p>

<p>After Valens had crossed the Bosphorus and come into Thrace he first spent a considerable
time at Constantinople, in alarm as to the issue of the war. He had sent Trajanus in
command of troops against the barbarians. When the general came back beaten, the emperor
reviled him sadly, and charged him with infirmity and cowardice. Boldly, as became a brave
man, Trajanus replied: “I have not been beaten, sir, it is thou who hast abandoned the victory
by fighting against God and transferring His support to the barbarians. Attacked by thee
He is taking their side, for victory is on God’s side and comes to them whom God leads.
Dost thou not know,” he went on, “whom thou hast expelled from their churches and to
whose government these churches have been delivered by thee?” Arintheus and Victor,802
generals like Trajanus, confirmed the truth of what he said, and implored the emperor not
to be angered by reproaches which were founded upon fact.803</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Of Isaac804the monk of Constantinople and Bretanio the Scythian Bishop.</head>
<p>It is related that Isaac, who lived as a solitary at Constantinople, when he saw Valens
marching out with his troops, cried aloud, “Whither goest thou, O emperor? To fight against
God, instead of having Him as thy ally? ’Tis God himself who has roused the barbarians
against thee, because thou hast stirred many tongues to blasphemy against Him and hast
driven His worshippers from their sacred abodes. Cease then thy campaigning and stop the
war. Give back to the flocks their excellent shepherds and thou shalt win victory without
trouble, but if thou fightest without so doing thou shalt learn by experience how hard it is
to kick against the pricks.805 Thou shalt never come back and shalt destroy thy army.” Then
in a passion the emperor rejoined, “I shall come back; and I will kill thee, and so exact
punishment for thy lying prophecy.” But Isaac undismayed by the threat exclaimed, “If what
I say be proved false, kill me.”</p>
<p>Bretanio, a man distinguished by various virtues, and entrusted with the episcopal
government of all the cities of Scythia, fired his soul with enthusiasm, and protested against
the corruption of doctrines, and the emperor’s lawless attacks upon the saints, crying in the

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Of the expedition of Valens against the Goths and how he paid the penalty
of his impiety.</head>
<p>Valens, however, spurned these excellent counsellors, and sent out his troops to join
battle while he himself sat waiting in a hamlet for the victory. His troops could not stand
against the barbarians’ charge, turned tail and were slain one after another as they fled, the
Romans fleeing at full speed and the barbarians chasing them with all their might. When
Valens heard of the defeat he strove to conceal himself in the village where he lay, but when
the barbarians came up they set the place on fire and together with it burnt the enemy of
piety. Thus in this present life Valens paid the penalty of his errors.807</p>
<note type="footnote">807 “On the 9th August, 378, a day long and fatally memorable in the annals of the empire, the legions of
Valens moved forth from their entrenched camp under the walls of Hadrianople, and after a march of eight
miles under the hot sun of August came in sight of the barbarian vanguard, behind which stretched the circling
line of the waggons that guarded the Gothic host. The soldiers of the empire, hot, thirsty, wearied out with hours
of waiting under the blaze of an August sun, and only half understanding that the negotiations were ended and
the battle begun, fought at a terrible disadvantage but fought not ill. The infantry on the left wing seem even to
have pushed back their enemies and penetrated to the Gothic waggons. But they were for some reason not
covered as usual by a force of cavalry and they were jammed into a too narrow space of ground where they could
not use their spears with effect, yet presented a terribly easy mark to the Gothic arrows. They fell in dense masses
as they had stood. Then the whole weight of the enemy’s attack was directed against the centre and right. When
the evening began to close in, the utterly routed Roman soldiers were rushing in disorderly flight from the fatal
field. The night, dark and moonless, may have protected some, but more met their death rushing blindly over
a rugged and unknown country. “Meanwhile Valens had sought shelter with a little knot of soldiers (the two
regiments of “Lancearii and Mattiarii”), who still remained unmoved amidst the surging sea of ruin. When their
ranks too were broken, and when some of his bravest officers had fallen around him, he joined the common
soldiers in their headlong flight. Struck by a Gothic arrow he fell to the ground, but was carried off by some of
the eunuchs and life-guardsmen who still accompanied him, to a peasant’s cottage hard by. The Goths, ignorant
of his rank, but eager to strip the gaily-clothed guardsmen, surrounded the cottage and attempted in vain to
burst in the doors. Then mounting to the roof they tried to smoke out the imprisoned inmates, but succeeding
beyond their desires, set fire to the cottage, and emperor, eunuchs, and life-guardsmen perished in the flames.
Only one of the body-guard escaped, who climbed out through one of the blazing windows and fell into the
hands of the barbarians. He told them when it was too late what a prize they had missed in their cruel eagerness,
nothing less than the emperor of Rome. Ecclesiastical historians for generations delighted to point the moral of the
story of Valens, that he who had seduced the whole Gothic nation into the heresy of Arius, and thus caused them to
suffer the punishment of everlasting fire, was himself by those very Goths burned alive on the terrible 9th of August.

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—How the Goths became tainted by the Arian error.</head>
<p>To those ignorant of the circumstances it may be worth while to explain how the Goths
got the Arian plague. After they had crossed the Danube, and made peace with Valens, the
infamous Eudoxius, who was on the spot, suggested to the emperor to persuade the Goths
to accept communion with him. They had indeed long since received the rays of divine
knowledge and had been nurtured in the apostolic doctrines, “but now,” said Eudoxius,
“community of opinion will make the peace all the firmer.” Valens approved of this counsel
and proposed to the Gothic chieftains an agreement in doctrine, but they replied that they
would not consent to forsake the teaching of their fathers. At the period in question their
Bishop Ulphilas was implicitly obeyed by them and they received his words as laws which
none might break. Partly by the fascination of his eloquence and partly by the bribes with
which he baited his proposals Eudoxius succeeded in inducing him to persuade the barbarians
to embrace communion with the emperor, so Ulphilas won them over on the plea that
the quarrel between the different parties was really one of personal rivalry and involved no
difference in doctrine. The result is that up to this day the Goths assert that the Father is
greater than the Son, but they refuse to describe the Son as a creature, although they are in
communion with those who do so. Yet they cannot be said to have altogether abandoned
their Father’s teaching, since Ulphilas in his efforts to persuade them to join communion
with Eudoxius and Valens denied that there was any difference in doctrine and that the
difference had arisen from mere empty strife.808</p>
<note type="footnote">808 Christianity is first found among the Goths and some German tribes on the Rhine about a.d. 300, the
Visigoths taking the lead, and being followed by the Ostrogoths. They were converted under Arian influences,
and simply accepted an Arian creed. So Salvian writes of them with singular charity, in a passage partly quoted
by Milman (Lat. Christ. I. p. 349.) “Hæretici sunt sed non scientes. Denique apud nos sunt hæretici, apud se
non sunt. Nam in tantum se catholicos esse judicant ut nos ipsos titulo hæreticæ appellationis infament. Quod
ergo illi nobis sunt, hoc nos illis. Nos eos injuriam divinæ generationis facere certi sumus quod minorem patre
filium dicant. Illi nos injuriosos patri existimant, quia æquales esse credamus. Veritas apud nos est. Sed illi apud
se esse proesumunt. Honor Dei apud nos est, sed illi hoc arbitrantur honorem divinitatis esse quod credunt.
Inofficiosi sunt; sed illis hoc est summum religionis officium. Impii sunt; sed hoc putant veram esse pietatem.
Errant ergo, sed bono animo errant, non odio, sed affectu Dei, honorare se dominum atque amare credentes.”
(Salvianus de Gub. Dei V. p. 87.) The spirit of this good Presbyter of Marseilles of the 5th century might well
have been more often followed in Christian controversy. “Of the early Arian missionaries the Arian Records, if
they ever existed, have almost entirely perished. The church was either ignorant of or disdained to preserve their
memory. Ulphilas alone,”—himself a semi-Arian, and accepter of the creed of Ariminum,—“the apostle of the
Goths, has, as it were, forced his way into the Catholic records, in which, as in the fragments of his great work,
his translation of the Scriptures into the Moeso-Gothic language, this admirable man has descended to posterity.”

<p>How the Lord God is long suffering towards those who rage against him, and chastises

loving Lord uses mercy and justice like weights and scales; whenever he sees any one by the
greatness of his errors over-stepping the bounds of loving kindness, by just punishment He
hinders him from being carried to further extremes.</p>
<p>Now Gratianus, the son of Valentinianus, and nephew of Valens, acquired the whole
Roman Empire. He had already assumed the sceptre of Europe on the death of his father,
in whose life-time he had shared the throne. On the death of Valens without issue he acquired
in addition Asia, and the portions of Libya.809</p>
<note type="footnote">quarters, spread their more or less rapid conquests over Gaul, Italy, and Spain, Ulphilas formed a peaceful and
populous colony of shepherds and herdsmen on the pastures below Mt. Hæmus. He became the primate of a

books of Kings”—which he omitted, as likely to whet his wild folks’ warlike passions,—“his translation of the

<p>The emperor at once gave plain indications of his adherence to true religion, and offered
the first fruits of his kingdom to the Lord of all, by publishing an edict commanding the
exiled shepherds to return, and to be restored to their flocks, and ordering the sacred
buildings to be delivered to congregations adopting communion with Damasus.810</p>
<p>This Damasus, the successor of Liberius in the see of Rome, was a man of most praiseworthy
life and by his own choice alike in word and deed a champion of Apostolic doctrines.
To put his edict in force Gratianus sent Sapor the general, a very famous character at that
time, with orders to expel the preachers of the blasphemies of Arius like wild beasts from
the sacred folds, and to effect the restoration of the excellent shepherds to God’s flocks.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Of the dissension caused by Paulinus; of the innovation by Apollinarius of
Laodicea, and of the philosophy of Meletius.</head>
<p>It has been already related how the defenders of the apostolic doctrines were divided
into two parties; how immediately after the conspiracy formed against the great Eustathius,
one section, in abhorrence of the Arian abomination, assembled together by themselves
with Paulinus for their bishop, while, after the ordination of Euzoius, the other party separated
themselves from the impious with the excellent Meletius, underwent the perils previously
described, and were guided by the wise instructions which Meletius gave them. Besides these
Apollinarius of Laodicea constituted himself leader of a third party, and though he assumed
a mask of piety, and appeared to defend apostolic doctrines, he was soon seen to be an open
foe. About the divine nature he used unsound arguments, and originated the idea of certain
degrees of dignities. He also had the hardihood to render the mystery of the incarnation811
imperfect and affirmed that the reasonable soul, which is entrusted with the guidance of
the body, was deprived of the salvation effected. For according to his argument God the
Word did not assume this soul, and so neither granted it His healing gift, nor gave it a portion
of His dignity. Thus the earthly body is represented as worshipped by invisible powers, while
the soul which is made in the image of God has remained below invested with the dishonour
of sin.812 Many more errors did he utter in his stumbling and blinded intelligence. At one
time even he was ready to confess that of the Holy Virgin the flesh had been taken, at another
time he represented it to have come down from heaven with God the Word, and yet again
that He had been made flesh and took nothing from us. Other vain tales and trifles which
I have thought it superfluous to repeat he mixed up with God’s gospel promises. By arguments
of this nature he not only filled his own friends with dangerous doctrine but even imparted
it to some among ourselves. As time went on, when they saw their own insignificance, and
beheld the splendour of the Church, all except a few were gathered into the Church’s communion.
But they did not quite put away their former unsoundness, and with it infected
many of the sound. This was the origin of the growth in the Church of the doctrine of the
one nature of the Flesh and of the Godhead, of the ascription to the Godhead of the Passion
of the only begotten, and of other points which have bred differences among the laity and
their priests. But these belong to a later date. At the time of which I am speaking, when
Sapor the General had arrived and had exhibited the imperial edict, Paulinus affirmed that
he sided with Damasus, and Apollinarius, concealing his unsoundness, did the same. The

<note type="footnote">812 Adopting Platonic and Pauline psychology giving body, soul and spirit (cf. 1 Thess. v. 23, and Gal. v. 17)
Apollinarius attributed to Christ a human body and a human soul or anima animans shared by man with brutes,
but not the reasonable soul, spirit or anima rationalis. In place of this he put the Divine Logos. The Word, he
said, was made Flesh not Spirit, God was manifest in the Flesh not Spirit.</note>

divine Meletius, on the other hand, made no sign, and put up with their dispute. Flavianus,
of high fame for his wisdom, who was at that time still in the ranks of the presbyterate, at
first said to Paulinus in the hearing of the officer “If, my dear friend, you accept communion
with Damasus, point out to us clearly how the doctrines agree, for he though he owns one
substance of the Trinity openly preaches three essences.813 You on the contrary deny the
Trinity of the essences. Shew us then how these doctrines are in harmony, and receive the
charge of the churches, as the edict enjoins.” After so silencing Paulinus by his arguments
he turned to Apollinarius and said, “I am astonished, my friend, to find you waging such
violent war against the truth, when all the while you know quite clearly how the admirable
Damasus maintains our nature to have been taken in its perfection by God the Word; but
you persist in saying the contrary, for you deprive our intelligence of its salvation. If these
our charges against you be false, deny now the novelty that you have originated; embrace
the teaching of Damasus, and receive the charge of the holy shrines.”</p>
<p>Thus Flavianus in his great wisdom stopped their bold speech with his true reasoning.</p>
<p>Meletius, who of all men was most meek, thus kindly and gently addressed Paulinus.
“The Lord of the sheep has put the care of these sheep in my hands: you have received the
charge of the rest: our little ones are in communion with one another in the true religion.
Therefore, my dear friend, let us join our flocks; let us have done with our dispute about
the leading of them, and, feeding the sheep together, let us tend them in common. If the
chief seat is the cause of strife, that strife I will endeavour to put away. On the chief seat I
will put the Holy Gospel; let us take our seats on each side of it; should I be the first to pass
away, you, my friend, will hold the leadership of the flock alone. Should this be your lot
before it is mine, I in my turn, so far as I am able, will take care of the sheep.” So gently and
kindly spoke the divine Meletius. Paulinus did not consent. The officer passed judgment
on what had been said and gave the churches to the great Meletius. Paulinus still continued
at the head of the sheep who had originally seceded.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Of Eusebius814 Bishop of Samosata.</head>
<p>Apollinarius after thus failing to get the government of the churches, continued, for the
future, openly to preach his new fangled doctrine, and constituted himself leader of the
heresy. He resided for the most part at Laodicea; but at Antioch he had already ordained
Vitalius, a man of excellent character, brought up in the apostolic doctrines, but afterwards
tainted with the heresy. Diodorus, whom I have already mentioned,815 who in the great
storm had saved the ship of the church from sinking, had been appointed by the divine
Meletius, bishop of Tarsus, and had received the charge of the Cilicians. The see of Apamea816
Meletius entrusted to John, a man of illustrious birth, more distinguished for his own high
qualities than for those of his forefathers, for he was conspicuous alike for the beauty of his
teaching and of his life. In the time of the tempest he piloted the assembly of his fellows in
the faith supported by the worthy Stephanus. The latter was however translated by the divine
Meletius to carry on another contest, for on the arrival of intelligence that Germanicia had
been contaminated by the Eudoxian pest he was sent thither as a physician to ward off the
disease, thoroughly trained as he had been in a complete heathen education as well as nurtured
in the Divine doctrines. He did not disappoint the expectations formed of him, for
by the power of his spiritual instruction he turned the wolves into sheep.817</p>
<p>On the return of the great Eusebius from exile he ordained Acacius whose fame is great
at Beroea,818 and at Hierapolis Theodotus,819 whose ascetic life is to this day in all men’s
mouths. Eusebius820 was moreover appointed to the see of Chalcis, and Isidorus821 to our
own city of Cyrus; both admirable men, conspicuous for their divine zeal.</p>

divine scriptures discourses with us, urging on us our duties, telling us what is befitting, terrifying us by threats,</note>

<pb n="306"/>
<p>Meletius is also reported to have ordained to the pastorate of Edessa, where the godly
Barses had already departed this life, Eulogius,822 the well known champion of apostolic
doctrines, who had been sent to Antinone with Protogenes. Eulogius gave Protogenes,823
his companion in hard service, the charge of Carræ, a healing physician for a sick city.</p>
<p>Lastly the divine Eusebius ordained Maris, Bishop of Doliche,824 a little city at that time
infected with the Arian plague. With the intention of enthroning this Maris, a right worthy
man, illustrious for various virtues, in the episcopal chair, the great Eusebius came to Doliche.
As he was entering into the town a woman thoroughly infected with the Arian plague let
fall a tile from the roof, which crushed in his head and so wounded him that not long after
he departed to the better life. As he lay a-dying he charged the bystanders not to exact the
slightest penalty from the woman who had done the deed, and bound them under oaths to
obey him. Thus he imitated his own Lord, who of them that crucified Him said “Father
forgive them for they know not what they do.”825</p>
<p>Thus, too, he followed the example of Stephanus, his fellow slave, who, after the stones
had stormed upon him, cried aloud, “Lord lay not this sin to their charge.”826 So died the
great Eusebius after many and various struggles. He had escaped the barbarians in Thrace,
but he did not escape the violence of impious heretics, and by their means won the martyr’s
crown.827</p>

proceeded to Pannonia.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Of the campaign of Theodosius.</head>
<p>Now at this time Theodosius, on account alike of the splendour of his ancestry,828 and
of his own courage, was a man of high repute. For this reason being from time to time
stricken by the envy of his rivals, he was living in Spain, where he had been born and brought
up.829 The emperor, being at a loss what measures to take, now that the barbarians, puffed
up by their victory, both were and seemed well nigh invincible, formed the idea that a way
out of his difficulties would be found in the appointment of Theodosius to the supreme
command. He therefore lost no time in sending for him from Spain, appointing830 him
commander in chief and despatching him at the head of the assembled forces.</p>
<p>Defended by his faith Theodosius marched confidently forth. On entering Thrace, and
beholding the barbarians advancing to meet him, he drew up his troops in order of battle.
The two lines met, and the enemy could not stand the attack and broke. A rout ensued, the
foe taking to flight and the conquerors pursuing at full speed. There was a great slaughter
of the barbarians, for they were slain not only by Romans but even by one another. After
the greater number of them had thus fallen, and a few of those who had been able to escape
pursuit had crossed the Danube, the great captain dispersed the troops which he commanded
among the neighbouring towns, and forthwith rode at speed to this emperor Gratianus,
himself the messenger of his own triumph. Even to the emperor himself, astounded at the
event, the tidings he carried seemed incredible, while others stung with envy gave out that
he had run away and lost his army. His only reply was to ask his gainsayers to send and ascertain
the number of the barbarian dead, “For,” said he, “even from their spoils it is easy
to learn their number.” At these words the emperor gave way and sent officers to investigate
and report on the battle.831</p>

a victory, and his alleged facts do not fit in with others which are better supported. Gratian, a vigorous and
sensible lad of nineteen, seems to have felt that the burden was too big for his shoulders, and to have looked out
for a suitable colleague. For the choice which he made, or was advised to make, he had good ground in the
reputation already won by Theodosius in Britain and in the campaign of 373 against the Sarmatians and Quadi,
and the elevation of the young general (born in 346, he was thirty two when Gratian declared him Augustus at
Sirmium, Jan. 19, 379) was speedily vindicated. Theodoret, with his contempt for exact chronology, may have
exaggerated one of the engagements of the guerrilla warfare waged by the new emperor after his accession, when
he carefully avoided the error of Valens in risking all on a pitched battle. By the end of 379 he had driven the</note>

<head>Chapter VI.—Of the reign of Theodosius and of his dream.</head>
<p>The great general remained, and then saw a wonderful vision clearly shewn him by the
very God of the universe himself. In it he seemed to see the divine Meletius, chief of the
church of the Antiochenes, investing him with an imperial robe, and covering his head with
an imperial crown. The morning after the night in which he had seen the vision he told it
to one of his intimate friends, who pointed out that the dream was plain and had nothing
obscure or ambiguous about it.</p>
<p>A few days at most had gone by when the commissioners sent to investigate the battle
returned and reported that vast multitudes of the barbarians had been shot down.</p>
<p>Then the emperor was convinced that he had done right well in selecting Theodosius
for the command, and appointed him emperor and gave him the sovereignty of the share
of Valens.</p>
<p>Upon this Gratian departed for Italy and despatched Theodosius to the countries committed
to his charge. No sooner had Theodosius assumed the imperial dignity than before
everything else he gave heed to the harmony of the churches, and ordered the bishops of
his own realm to repair with haste to Constantinople. That division of the empire was now
the only region infected with the Arian plague, for the west had escaped the taint. This was
due to the fact that Constantine the eldest of Constantine’s sons, and Constans the youngest,
had preserved their father’s faith in its integrity, and that Valentinian, emperor of the West,
had also kept the true religion undefiled.</p>

couriers to fetch Theodosius thither from remoter Spain, for Theodosius then in the winter months to organize
and carry out a campaign.</note>

<head>Chapter VII.—Of famous leaders of the Arian faction.</head>
<p>The Eastern section of the empire had received the infection from many quarters. Arius,
a presbyter of Alexandria in Egypt, there begat the blasphemy. Eusebius, Patrophilus, and
Aetius of Palestine, Paulinus and Gregorius of Phoenicia, Theodotus of Laodicea and his
successor Georgius, and after him Athanasius and Narcissus of Cilicia, had nurtured the
seeds so foully sown. Eusebius and Theognis of Bithynia; Menophantus of Ephesus;
Theodorus of Perinthus and Maris of Chalcedon, and some others of Thrace famous only
for their vices, had for a long time gone on watering and tending the crop of tares. These
bad husbandmen were aided by the indifference of Constantius and the malignity of Valens.</p>
<p>For these reasons only the bishops of his own empire were summoned by the emperor
to meet at Constantinople. They arrived, being in all one hundred and fifty in number, and
Theodosius forbade any one to tell him which was the great Meletius, for he wished the
bishop to be recognized by his dream. The whole company of the bishops entered the imperial
palace, and then without any notice of all the rest, Theodosius ran up to the great
Meletius, and, like a boy who loves his father, stood for a long space gazing on him with filial
joy, then flung his arms around him, and covered eyes and lips and breast and head and
the hand that had given him the crown, with kisses. Then he told him of his dream. All the
rest of the bishops were then courteously welcomed, and all were bidden to deliberate as
became fathers on the subjects laid before them.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The council assembled at Constantinople.</head>
<p>At this time the recent feeder of the flock at Nazianzus832 was living at Constantino
ple,833 continually withstanding the blasphemies of the Arians, watering the holy people
with the teaching of the Gospel, catching wanderers outside the flock and removing them
from poisonous pasture. So that flock once small he made a great one. When the divine
Meletius saw him, knowing as he did full well the object which the makers of the canon834
had before them when, with the view of preventing the possibility of ambitious efforts, they
forbade the translation of bishops, he confirmed Gregory in the episcopate of Constantinople.
835 Shortly afterwards the divine Meletius passed away to the life that knows no
pain, crowned by the praises of the funeral eloquence of all the great orators.</p>
<note type="footnote">832 “Cave credas episcopum Nazianzi his verbis designari,” says Valesius;—because before 381 the great
Gregory of Nazianzus had at the most first helped his father in looking after the church at Nazianzus, and on
his father’s death taken temporary and apparently informal charge of the see. But in the latter part of his note
Valesius suggests that τὰ τελευταῖα may refer to the episcopate of Gregory at Nazianzus in his last days, after
his abdication of the see of Constantinople,—“Atque hic sensus magis placet, magis enim convenire videtur
verbis Theodoreti;” “Recent feeder,” then, or “he who most recently fed,” will mean “he who after the events at
Constantinople which I am about to relate, acted as bishop of Nazianzus.” Gregory left Constantinople in June
381, repaired to Nazianzus, and after finding a suitable man to occupy the see, retired to Arianzus, but was
pressed to return and take a leading post in order to check Apollinarian heretics. His health broke down, and
he wished to retire. He would have voted in the election of his successor, but his opponents objected on the
ground that he either was bishop of Nazianzus, or not; if he was, there was no vacancy; if he was not, he had no
vote. Eulalius was chosen in 383, and Gregory spent six weary years in wanderings and troubles, and at last
found in rest in 389.</note>
<note type="footnote">833 It was probably in 379 that Gregory first went to Constantinople and preached in a private house which
was to him a “Shiloh, where the ark rested, an Anastasia, a place of resurrection” (Orat. 42. 6). Hence the name
“Anastasia” given to the famous church built on the site of the too strait house.</note>

Gregory himself classes it among “Νόμους πάλαι τεθνηκότας” (Carm. 1810–11).</note>
<note type="footnote">835 Gregory had been practically acting as bishop, when an intriguing party led by Peter of Alexandria tried
to force Maximus, a cynic professor, who was one of Gregory’s admiring hearers, on the Constantinopolitan
Church. “At this time,” i.e. probably in the middle of 380, and certainly before Nov. 24, when Theodosius entered
the capital, “A priest from Thasco had come to Constantinople with a large sum of money to buy Proconnesian
marble for a church. He too was beguiled by the specious hope held out to him. Maximus and his party thus
gained the power of purchasing the service of a mob, which was as forward to attack Gregory as it had been to
praise him. It was night, and the bishop was ill in bed, when Maximus with his followers went to the church to
be consecrated by five suffragans who had been sent from Alexandria for the purpose. Day began to dawn while
they were till preparing for the consecration. They had but half finished the tonsure of the cynic philosopher,</note>

<pb n="311"/>
<p>Timotheus, bishop of Alexandria, who had followed Peter, the successor of Athanasius
in the patriarchate, ordained in place of the admirable Gregorius, Maximus—a cynic who
had but recently suffered his cynic’s hair to be shorn, and had been carried away by the
flimsy rhetoric of Apollinarius. But this absurdity was beyond the endurance of the assembled
bishops—admirable men, and full of divine zeal and wisdom, such as Helladius, successor
of the great Basil, Gregorius and Peter, brothers of Basil, and Amphilochius from Lycaonia,
Optimus from Pisidia, Diodorus from Cilicia.836</p>
<p>The council was also attended by Pelagius of Laodicæa,837 Eulogius of Edessa,838 Acacius,
839 our own Isidorus,840 Cyril of Jerusalem, Gelasius of Cæsarea in Palestine,841 who
was renowned alike for lore and life and many other athletes of virtue.</p>
<p>All these then whom I have named separated themselves from the Egyptians and celebrated
divine service with the great Gregory. But he himself implored them, assembled as
they were to promote harmony, to subordinate all question of wrong to an individual to the
promotion of agreement with one another. “For,” said he, “I shall be released from many
cares and once more lead the quiet life I hold so dear; while you, after your long and painful
warfare, will obtain the longed for peace. What can be more absurd than for men who have
just escaped the weapons of their enemies to waste their own strength in wounding one
another; by so doing we shall be a laughing stock to our opponents. Find then some worthy
man of sense, able to sustain heavy responsibilities and discharge them well, and make him
bishop.” The excellent pastors moved by these counsels appointed as bishop of that mighty
city a man of noble birth and distinguished for every kind of virtue as well as for the
splendour of his ancestry, by name Nectarius. Maximus, as having participated in the insanity
of Apollinarius, they stripped of his episcopal rank and rejected. They next enacted canons
concerning the good government of the church, and published a confirmation of the faith
<note type="footnote">who wore the flowing hair common to his sect, when a mob, excited by the sudden news, rushed in upon them,
and drove them from the church. They retired to a flute player’s shop to complete their work, and Maximus,
compelled to flee from Constantinople, went to Thessalonica with the hope of gaining over Theodosius himself.”

number of them assembled again in the same city, summoned once more by the needs of
the church, and received a synodical letter from the bishops of the west inviting them to
come to Rome, where a great synod was being assembled. They begged however to be excused
from travelling thus far abroad; their doing so, they said, would be useless. They wrote

<head>Chapter IX.—Synodical letter from the council at Constantinople.</head>
<p>“To the right honourable lords our right reverend brethren and colleagues Damasus,
Ambrosius, Britton, Valerianus, Ascholius, Anemius, Basilius and the rest of the holy bishops
assembled in the great city of Rome, the holy synod of the orthodox bishops assembled at
the great city of Constantinople, sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“To recount all the sufferings inflicted on us by the power of the Arians, and to attempt
to give information to your reverences, as though you were not already well acquainted with
them, might seem superfluous. For we do not suppose your piety to hold what is befalling
us as of such secondary importance as that you stand in any need of information on matter’s
which cannot but evoke your sympathy. Nor indeed were the storms which beset us such
as to escape notice from their insignificance. Our persecutions are but of yesterday. The
sound of them still rings in the ears alike of those who suffered them and of those whose
love made the sufferers’ pain their own. It was but a day or two ago, if I may so say, that
some released from chains in foreign lands returned to their own churches through manifold
afflictions; of others who had died in exile the relics were brought home; others again, even
after their return from exile, found the passion of the heretics still at boiling heat, and, slain
by them with stones as was the blessed Stephen, met with a sadder fate in their own than in
a stranger’s land. Others, worn away with various cruelties, still bear in their bodies the scars
of their wounds and the marks of Christ.842</p>
<p>“Who could tell the tale of fines, of disfranchisements, of individual confiscations, of
intrigues, of outrages, of prisons? In truth all kinds of tribulation were wrought out beyond
number in us, perhaps because we were paying the penalty of sins, perhaps because the
merciful God was trying us by means of the multitude of our sufferings. For these all thanks
to God, who by means of such afflictions trained his servants and, according to the multitude
of his mercies, brought us again to refreshment. We indeed needed long leisure, time, and
toil to restore the church once more, that so, like physicians healing the body after long
sickness and expelling its disease by gradual treatment, we might bring her back to her ancient
health of true religion. It is true that on the whole we seem to have been delivered from the
violence of our persecutions and to be just now recovering the churches which have for a
long time been the prey of the heretics. But wolves are troublesome to us who, though they
have been driven from the byre, yet harry the flocks up and down the glades, daring to hold
rival assemblies, stirring seditions among the people, and shrinking from nothing which
can do damage to the churches.</p>
<p>“So, as we have already said, we needs must labour all the longer. Since however you
showed your brotherly love to us by inviting us (as though we were your own members) by
the letters of our most religious emperor to the synod which you are gathering by divine

permission at Rome, to the end that since we alone were then condemned to suffer persecution,
you should not now, when our emperors are at one with us as to true religion, reign
apart from us, but that we, to use the apostle’s phrase,843 should reign with you, our prayer
was, if it were possible, all in company to leave our churches, and rather gratify our longing
to see you than consult their needs. For who will give us wings as of a dove, and we will fly
and be at rest?844 But this course seemed likely to leave the churches who were just recovering
quite undefended, and the undertaking was to most of us impossible, for, in accordance
with the letters sent a year ago from your holiness after the synod at Aquileia to the most
pious emperor Theodosius, we had journeyed to Constantinople, equipped only for travelling
so far as Constantinople, and bringing the consent of the bishops remaining in the provinces
for this synod alone. We had been in no expectation of any longer journey nor had heard
a word about it before our arrival at Constantinople. In addition to all this, and on account
of the narrow limits of the appointed time which allowed of no preparation for a longer
journey, nor of communicating with the bishops of our communion in the provinces and
of obtaining their consent, the journey to Rome was for the majority impossible. We have
therefore adopted the next best course open to us under the circumstances, both for the
better administration of the church, and for manifesting our love towards you, by strongly
urging our most venerated, and honoured colleagues and brother bishops Cyriacus, Eusebius
and Priscianus, to consent to travel to you.</p>
<p>“Through them we wish to make it plain that our disposition is all for peace with unity
for its sole object, and that we are full of zeal for the right faith. For we, whether we suffered
persecutions, or afflictions, or the threats of emperors, or the cruelties of princes or any
other trial at the hands of heretics, have undergone all for the sake of the evangelic faith,
ratified by the three hundred and eighteen fathers at Nicæa in Bithynia. This is the faith

<p>“According to this faith there is one Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and

consubstantial and co-eternal trinity a nature posterior, created and of a different substance.
We moreover preserve unperverted the doctrine of the incarnation of the Lord, holding the
tradition that the dispensation of the flesh is neither soulless nor mindless nor imperfect;
and knowing full well that God’s Word was perfect before the ages, and became perfect man
in the last days for our salvation.</p>
<p>“Let this suffice for a summary of the doctrine which is fearlessly and frankly preached
by us, and concerning which you will be able to be still further satisfied if you will deign to
read the report of the synod of Antioch, and also that issued last year by the oecumenical
council held at Constantinople, in which we have set forth our confession of the faith at
greater length, and have appended an anathema against the heresies which innovators have
recently inscribed.</p>
<p>“Now as to the particular administration of individual churches, an ancient custom, as
you know, has obtained, confirmed by the enactment of the holy fathers at Nicæa, that, in
every province, the bishops of the province, and, with their consent, the neighbouring
bishops with them, should perform ordinations as expediency may require. In conforming
with these customs note that other churches have been administered by us and the priests
of the most famous churches publicly appointed. Accordingly over the new made (if the
expression be allowable) church at Constantinople, which, as though from a lion’s mouth,
we have lately snatched by God’s mercy from the blasphemy of the heretics, we have ordained
bishop the right reverend and most religious Nectarius, in the presence of the oecumenical
council, with common consent, before the most religious emperor Theodosius, and with
the assent of all the clergy and of the whole city. And over the most ancient and truly
apostolic church in Syria, where first the noble name of Christians847 was given them, the
bishops of the province and of the eastern diocese848 have met together and canonically
ordained bishop the right reverend and most religious Flavianus, with the consent of all the
church, who as though with one voice joined in expressing their respect for him. This
rightful ordination also received the sanction of the general council. Of the church at Jerusalem,
mother of all the churches, we make known that the right reverend and most religious
Cyril is bishop, who was some time ago canonically ordained by the bishops of the province,
and has in several places fought a good fight against the Arians. We beseech your reverence
to rejoice at what has thus been rightly and canonically settled by us, by the intervention of
spiritual love and by the influence of the fear of the Lord, compelling the feelings of men,
and making the edification of churches of more importance than individual grace or favour.
Thus since among us there is agreement in the faith and Christian charity has been established,
we shall cease to use the phrase condemned by the apostles, ‘I am of Paul and I of

grace we will keep the body of the church unrent, and will boldly stand at the judgment seat
of the Lord.”</p>
<p>These things they wrote against the madness of Arius, Aetius, and Eunomius; and
moreover against Sabellius, Photinus, Marcellus, Paul of Samosata, and Macedonius. Similarly
they openly condemned the innovation of Apollinarius in the phrase, “And we preserve the
doctrine of the incarnation of the Lord, holding the tradition that the dispensation of the
flesh is neither soulless, nor mindless, nor imperfect.”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Synodical letter of Damasus bishop of Rome against Apollinarius and Timotheus.</head>
<p>When the most praiseworthy Damasus had heard of the rise of this heresy, he proclaimed
the condemnation not only of Apollinarius but also of Timotheus his follower. The letter
in which he made this known to the bishops of the Eastern empire I have thought it well to
insert in my history.</p>
<p>Letter of Damasus bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>“Most honourable sons: Inasmuch as your love renders to the apostolic see the reverence
which is its due, accept the same in no niggard measure for yourselves.850 For even though
in the holy church in which the holy apostle sat, and taught us how it becomes us to manage
the rudder which has been committed to us, we nevertheless confess ourselves to be unworthy
of the honour, we yet on this very account strive by every means within our power if haply
we may be able to achieve the glory of that blessedness. Know then that we have condemned
Timotheus, the unhallowed, the disciple of Apollinarius the heretic, together with his impious
doctrine, and are confident that for the future his remains will have no weight whatever.
But if that old serpent, though smitten once and again, still revives to his own destruction,
who though he exists without the church never ceases from the attempt by his deadly venom
to overthrow certain unfaithful men, do you avoid it as you would a pest, mindful ever of
the apostolic faith—that, I mean, which was set out in writing by the Fathers at Nicæa; do
you remain on steady ground, firm and unmoved in the faith, and henceforward suffer
neither your clergy nor laity to listen to vain words and futile questions, for we have already
given a form, that he who professes himself a Christian may keep it, the form delivered by
the Apostles, as says St. Paul, ‘if any one preach to you another gospel than that you have
received let him be Anathema.’851 For Christ the Son of God, our Lord, gave by his own
passion abundant salvation to the race of men, that he might free from all sin the whole
man involved in sin. If any one speaks of Christ as having had less of manhood or of Godhead,
he is full of devils’ spirits, and proclaims himself a child of hell.</p>
<p>“Why then do you again ask me for the condemnation of Timotheus? Here, by the
judgment of the apostolic see, in the presence of Peter, bishop of Alexandria, he was condemned,
together with his teacher, Apollinarius, who will also in the day of judgment undergo
due punishment and torment. But if he succeeds in persuading some less stable men,

<head>Chapter XI.—A confession of the Catholic faith which Pope Damasus sent to Bishop Paulinus852
in Macedonia when he was at Thessalonica.</head>
<p>After the Council of Nicæa there sprung up this error. Certain men ventured with profane
mouths to say that the Holy Spirit is made through the Son. We therefore anathematize
those who do not with all freedom preach that the Holy Spirit is of one and the same substance
and power with the Father and the Son. In like manner we anathematize them that
follow the error of Sabellius and say that the Father and the Son are the same. We anathematize
Arius and Eunomius who with equal impiety, though with differences of phrase,
maintain the Son and the Holy Spirit to be a creature. We anathematize the Macedonians
who, produced from the root of Arius, have changed the name but not the impiety. We
anathematize Photinus who, renewing the heresy of Ebion, confessed that our Lord Jesus
Christ was only of Mary.853 We anathematize them that maintain that there are two
sons—one before the ages and another after the assumption of the flesh from Mary. We
anathematize also all who maintain that the Word of God moved in human flesh instead
of a reasonable soul. For this Word of God Himself was not in His own body instead of a
reasonable and intellectual soul, but assumed and saved our soul, both reasonable and intellectual,
without sin.854 We anathematize also them that say that the Word of God is separated
from the Father by extension and contraction, and blasphemously affirm that He is without
essential being or is destined to die.</p>
<p>Them that have gone from churches to other churches we so far hold alien from our
communion till they shall have returned to those cities in which they were first ordained.</p>
<p>If any one, when another has gone from place to place, has been ordained in his stead,
let him who abandoned his own city be held deprived of his episcopal rank until such time
as his successor shall rest in the Lord.</p>
<note type="footnote">852 As to who this Paulinus was, and when this confession was sent to him, there has been some confusion.
Theodoret has been supposed to write “bishop of Thessalonica,” and then has been found fault with by Baronius
for describing the Paulinus the Eustathian bishop of Antioch as of Thessalonica in order to conceal the fact of
Damasus and the Antiochene Paulinus being in communion. But the patronage of this Paulinus by Damasus
was notorious, and if Theodoret wanted to ignore it, he need not have inserted this document at all. But, as
Valesius points out, all that Theodoret says is that Damasus sent it to bishop Paulinus, when he was at Thessalonica,
and calls attention to the recognition of this by Baronius (ann. 378. 44). The letter is in the Holsteinian
Collection, with the heading “Dilectissimo fratri Paulino Damasus.” Paulinus was probably at Thessalonica on
his way from Rome in 382.</note>

<head>Chapter XII.—Of the death of Gratianus and the sovereignty of Maximus</head>
<p>Gratianus in the midst of his successes in war and wise and prudent government ended
his life by conspiracy.861 He left no sons to inherit the empire, and a brother of the same
name as their father, Valentinianus,862 who was quite a youth. So Maximus,863 in contempt
of the youth of Valentinianus, seized the throne of the West.</p>
<note type="footnote">861 Gratianus made himself unpopular (i) by his excessive addiction to sport, playing the Commodus in the
“Vivaria,” when not even a Marcus Aurelius could have answered all the calls of the Empire. (Amm. xxxi. x. 19)
and (ii) by affecting the society and customs of barbarians (Aur. Vict. xlvii. 6). The troops in Britain rose against
him, gathered aid in the Low Countries, and defeated him near Paris. He fled to Lyons, where he was treacherously
assassinated Aug. 25, 383. He was only twenty-four. (Soc. v. 11.)</note>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Of Justina, the wife of Valentinianus, and of her plot against Ambrosius.</head>
<p>At this time Justina,864 wife of Valentinianus the great, and mother of the young prince,
made known to her son the seeds of the Arian teaching which she had long ago received.
Well knowing the warmth of her consort’s faith she had endeavoured to conceal her sentiments
during the whole of his life, but perceiving that her son’s character was gentle and
docile, she took courage to bring her deceitful doctrine forward. The lad supposed his
mother’s counsels to be wise and beneficial, for nature so disposed the bait that he could
not see the deadly hook below. He first communicated on the subject with Ambrosius, under
the impression that, if he could persuade the bishop, he would be able without difficulty to
prevail over the rest. Ambrosius, however, strove to remind him of his father’s piety, and
exhorted him to keep inviolate the heritage which he had received. He explained to him
also how one doctrine differed from the other, how the one is in agreement with the teaching
of the Lord and with the teaching of his apostles, while the other is totally opposed to it and
at war with the code of the laws of the spirit.</p>
<p>The young man, as young men will, spurred on moreover by a mother herself the victim
of deceit, not only did not assent to the arguments adduced, but lost his temper, and, in a
passion, was for surrounding the approaches to the church with companies of legionaries
and targeteers. When, however, he learnt that this illustrious champion was not in the least
alarmed at his proceedings, for Ambrosius treated them all like the ghosts and hobgoblins
with which some men try to frighten babies, he was exceedingly angry and publicly ordered
him to depart from the church. “I shall not,” said Ambrosius, “do so willingly. I will not
yield the sheepfold to the wolves nor betray God’s temple to blasphemers. If you wish to
slay me drive your sword or your spear into me here within. I shall welcome such a death.”865</p>
<note type="footnote">864 Justina, left widow by Magnentius in 353, was married to Valentinian I. (we may dismiss the story of
Socrates (iv. 31) that he legalized bigamy in order to marry her in the lifetime of Severa) probably in 368. Her
first conflict with Ambrose was probably in 380 at Sirmium. On the murder of Gratian in 383 Maximus for four
years left the young Valentinian in possession of Italy, in deference to the pleading of Ambrose. It was during
this period, at Easter, 385, that Justina ungratefully attacked the bishop and demanded a church for Arian worship.</note>
<note type="footnote">865 This contest is described by Ambrose himself in letters to Valentinian and to his sister Marcellina, Epp.
xx. xxi, and in the “Sermo de basilicis tradendis.” On the apparent error of Gibbon in confusing the “vela” which

<p>After a considerable time Maximus866 was informed of the attacks which were being
made upon the loud-voiced herald of the truth, and he sent dispatches to Valentinianus
charging him to put a stop to his war against true religion and exhorting him not to abandon
his father’s faith. In the event of his advice being disregarded he further threatened war, and
confirmed what he wrote by what he did,867 for he mustered his forces and marched for
Milan where Valentinianus was then residing. When the latter heard of his approach he
fled into Illyricum.868 He had learnt by experience what good he had got by following his
mother’s advice.</p>
<note type="footnote">866 After Easter, 387.</note>
<note type="footnote">867 The motives here stated seem to have had little to do with the march of Maximus over the Alps. Indeed
so far from enthusiasm for Ambrose and the Ambrosian view of the faith being conspicuous in the invader, he
had received the bishop at Treves as envoy from Valentinian, had refused to be diverted from his purpose, and
had moreover taken offence at the objection of Ambrose to communicate with the bishops who had been concerned
in the first capital punishment of a heretic—i.e. Priscillian.</note>

<head>Chapter XV.—Of the Letter written by the Emperor Theodosius concerning the same.</head>
<p>When the illustrious emperor Theodosius had heard of the emperor’s doings and what
the tyrant Maximus had written to him he wrote to the fugitive youth to this effect: You
must not be astonished if to you has come panic and to your enemy victory; for you have
been fighting against piety, and he on its side. You abandoned it, and are running away naked.
He in its panoply is getting the mastery of you stripped bare of it, for He who hath given us
the law of true religion is ever on its side.</p>
<p>So wrote Theodosius when he was yet afar off; but when he had heard of Valentinian’s
flight, and had come to his aid, and saw him an exile, taking refuge in his own empire, his
first thought was to give succour to his soul, drive out the intruding pestilence of impiety,
and win him back to the true religion of his fathers. Then he bade him be of good cheer and
marched against the tyrant. He gave the lad his empire again without loss of blood and slew
Maximus. For he felt that he should be guilty of wrong and should violate the terms of his
treaty with Gratianus were he not to take vengeance on those who had caused his ally’s
death.869</p>
<note type="footnote">869 Zosimus (iv. 44) represents Theodosius, now for two years widowed, as won over to the cause of
Valentinian by the loveliness of the young princess Galla, whom he married. “He was some time in preparing for
the campaign, but, when it was opened, he conducted it with vigour and decision. His troops passed up the Save Valley,
defeated those of Maximus in two engagements, entered Æmona (Laybach) in triumph, and soon stood before the walls
of Aquileia, behind which Maximus was sheltering himself.…The soldiers of Theodosius poured into the city, of which
the gates had been opened to them by the mutineers, and dragged off the usurper, barefooted, with tied hands, in slave’s
attire, to the tribunal of Theodosius and his young brother in law at the third milestone from the city. After Theodosius
had in a short harangue reproached him with the evil deeds which he had wrought against the Roman Commonwealth,
he handed him over to the executioner.” Hodgkin, “Dynasty of Theodosius,” p. 127.</note>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Of Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.</head>
<p>On the emperor’s return the admirable Amphilochius, whom I have often mentioned,
came to beg that the Arian congregations might be expelled from the cities. The emperor
thought the petition too severe, and refused it. The very wise Amphilochius at the moment
was silent, for he had hit upon a memorable device. The next time he entered the Palace
and beheld standing at the emperor’s side his son Arcadius, who had lately been appointed
emperor, he saluted Theodosius as was his wont, but did no honour to Arcadius. The emperor,
thinking that this neglect was due to forgetfulness, commanded Amphilochius to
approach and to salute his son. “Sir,” said he, “the honour which I have paid you is enough.”
Theodosius was indignant at the discourtesy, and said, “Dishonour done to my son is a
rudeness to myself.” Then, and not till then, the very wise Amphilochius disclosed the object
of his conduct, and said with a loud voice, “You see, sir, that you do not brook dishonour
done your son, and are bitterly angry with those who are rude to him. Believe then that the
God of all the world abominates them that blaspheme the Only begotten Son, and hates
them as ungrateful to their Saviour and Benefactor.”</p>
<p>Then the emperor understood the bishop’s drift, and admired both what he had done
and what he had said. Without further delay he put out an edict forbidding the congregations
of heretics.870</p>
<p>But to escape all the snares of the common enemy of mankind is no easy task. Often it
happens that one who has kept clear of lascivious passion is fixed fast in the toils of avarice;
and if he prove superior to greed there on the other side is the pitfall of envy, and even if he
leap safe over this he will find a net of passion waiting for him on the other side. Other innumerable
stumbling blocks the enemy sets in men’s paths, trying to catch them to their
ruin.871</p>
<p>Then he has at his disposal the bodily passions to help the wiles which he lays against
the soul. The mind alone, if it keep awake, gets the better of him, frustrating the assault of
his devices by its inclination to what is Divine. Now, since this admirable emperor had his
share of human nature,872 and was not free from its emotions, his righteous anger passed
the bounds of moderation, and caused the perpetration of a savage and lawless deed. I must
tell this story for the sake of those into whose hands it will fall; it does not, indeed, only in-

<head>Chapter XVII.—Of the massacre of Thessalonica; the boldness of Bishop Ambrosius, and the
piety of the Emperor.</head>
<p>Thessalonica is a large and very populous city, belonging to Macedonia, but the capital
of Thessaly and Achaia, as well as of many other provinces which are governed by the prefect
of Illyricum. Here arose a great sedition, and several of the magistrates were stoned and violently
treated.873</p>
<p>The emperor was fired with anger when he heard the news, and unable to endure the
rush of his passion, did not even check its onset by the curb of reason, but allowed his rage
to be the minister of his vengeance. When the imperial passion had received its authority,
as though itself an independent prince, it broke the bonds and yoke of reason, unsheathed
swords of injustice right and left without distinction, and slew innocent and guilty together.
No trial preceded the sentence. No condemnation was passed on the perpetrators of the
crimes. Multitudes were mowed down like ears of corn in harvest-tide. It is said that seven
thousand perished.</p>
<p>News of this lamentable calamity reached Ambrosius. The emperor on his arrival at
Milan wished according to custom to enter the church. Ambrosius met him outside the
outer porch and forbade him to step over the sacred threshold. “You seem, sir, not to know,”
said he, “the magnitude of the bloody deed that has been done. Your rage has subsided, but
your reason has not yet recognised the character of the deed. Peradventure your Imperial
power prevents your recognising the sin, and power stands in the light of reason. We must
however know how our nature passes away and is subject to death; we must know the ancestral
dust from which we sprang, and to which we are swiftly returning. We must not because
we are dazzled by the sheen of the purple fail to see the weakness of the body that it
robes. You are a sovereign, Sir, of men of like nature with your own, and who are in truth
your fellow slaves; for there is one Lord and Sovereign of mankind, Creator of the Universe.
With what eyes then will you look on the temple of our common Lord—with what feet will

<p>Educated as he had been in the sacred oracles, Theodosius knew clearly what belonged
to priests and what to emperors. He therefore bowed to the rebuke of Ambrose, and retired
sighing and weeping to the palace. After a considerable time, when eight months had passed
away, the festival of our Saviour’s birth came round and the emperor sat in his palace
shedding a storm of tears.</p>
<p>Now Rufinus, at that time controller of the household,875 and, from his familiarity with
his imperial master, able to use great freedom of speech, approached and asked him why
he wept. With a bitter groan and yet more abundant weeping “You are trifling, Rufinus,”
said the emperor, “because you do not feel my troubles. I am groaning and lamenting at the
thought of my own calamity; for menials and for beggars the way into the church lies open;
they can go in without fear, and put up their petitions to their own Lord. I dare not set my
foot there, and besides this for me the door of heaven is shut, for I remember the voice of
the Lord which plainly says, ‘Whatsoever ye bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven.’”876</p>
<p>Rufinus replied “With your permission I will hasten to the bishop, and by my entreaties
induce him to remit your penalty.” “He will not yield” said the emperor. “I know the justice
of the sentence passed by Ambrose, nor will he ever be moved by respect for my imperial
power to transgress the law of God.”</p>
<p>Rufinus urged his suit again and again, promising to win over Ambrosius; and at last
the emperor commanded him to go with all despatch. Then, the victim of false hopes,
Theodosius, in reliance on the promises of Rufinus, followed in person, himself. No sooner
did the divine Ambrose perceive Rufinus than he exclaimed, “Rufinus, your impudence
matches a dog’s, for you were the adviser of this terrible slaughter; you have wiped shame
from your brow, and guilty as you are of this mad outrage on the image of God you stand
here fearless, without a blush.” Then Rufinus began to beg and pray, and announced the
speedy approach of the emperor. Fired with divine zeal the holy Ambrosius exclaimed
“Rufinus, I tell you beforehand; I shall prevent him from crossing the sacred threshold. If

he is for changing his sovereign power into that of a tyrant I too will gladly submit to a violent
death.” On this Rufinus sent a messenger to inform the emperor in what mind the archbishop
was, and exhorted him to remain within the palace. Theodosius had already reached the
middle of the forum when he received the message. “I will go,” said he, “and accept the
disgrace I deserve.” He advanced to the sacred precincts but did not enter the holy building.
The archbishop was seated in the house of salutation877 and there the emperor approached
him and besought that his bonds might be loosed.</p>
<p>“Your coming” said Ambrose “is the coming of a tyrant. You are raging against God;
you are trampling on his laws.” “No,” said Theodosius, “I do not attack laws laid down, I
do not seek wrongfully to cross the sacred threshold; but I ask you to loose my bond, to take
into account the mercy of our common Lord, and not to shut against me a door which our
master has opened for all them that repent.” The archbishop replied “What repentance have
you shown since your tremendous crime? You have inflicted wounds right hard to heal;
what salve have you applied?” “Yours” said the emperor “is the duty alike of pointing out
and of mixing the salve. It is for me to receive what is given me.” Then said the divine Ambrosius
“You let your passion minister justice, your passion not your reason gives judgment.
Put forth therefore an edict which shall make the sentence of your passion null and void;
let the sentences which have been published inflicting death or confiscation be suspended
for thirty days awaiting the judgment of reason. When the days shall have elapsed let them
that wrote the sentences exhibit their orders, and then, and not till then, when passion has
calmed down, reason acting as sole judge shall examine the sentences and will see whether
they be right or wrong. If it find them wrong it will cancel the deeds; if they be righteous it
will confirm them, and the interval of time will inflict no wrong on them that have been
rightly condemned.”</p>
<p>This suggestion the emperor accepted and thought it admirable. He ordered the edict
to be put out forthwith and gave it the authority of his sign manual. On this the divine
Ambrosius loosed the bond.</p>
<p>Now the very faithful emperor came boldly within the holy temple but did not pray to
his Lord standing, or even on his knees, but lying prone upon the ground he uttered David’s
cry “My soul cleaveth unto the dust, quicken thou me according to thy word.”878</p>
<note type="footnote">877 Valesius says that this “house of salutation” according to Scaliger was the episcopal hospitium or guest
quarters. His own opinion however is that it was the audience chamber or chapter-house of the church where
the bishop with his presbyters received the faithful who came to his church.</note>

<p>He plucked out his hair; he smote his head; he besprinkled the ground with drops of
tears and prayed for pardon. When the time came for him to bring his oblations to the holy
table, weeping all the while he stood up and approached the sanctuary.879</p>
<p>After making his offering, as he was wont, he remained within at the rail, but once more
the great Ambrosius kept not silence and taught him the distinction of places. First he asked
him if he wanted anything; and when the emperor said that he was waiting for participation
in the divine mysteries, Ambrose sent word to him by the chief deacon and said, “The inner
place, sir, is open only to priests; to all the rest it is inaccessible; go out and stand where
others stand; purple can make emperors, but not priests.” This instruction too the faithful
emperor most gladly received, and intimated in reply that it was not from any audacity that
he had remained within the rails, but because he had understood that this was the custom
at Constantinople. “I owe thanks,” he added, “for being cured too of this error.”</p>
<p>So both the archbishop and the emperor showed a mighty shining light of virtue. Both
to me are admirable; the former for his brave words, the latter for his docility; the archbishop
for the warmth of his zeal, and the prince for the purity of his faith.</p>
<p>On his return to Constantinople Theodosius kept within the bounds of piety which he
had learnt from the great archbishop. For when the occasion of a feast brought him once
again into the divine temple, after bringing his gifts to the holy table he straightway went
out. The bishop at that time was Nectarius, and on his asking the emperor what could possibly
be the reason of his not remaining within, Theodosius answered with a sigh “I have learnt
after great difficulty the differences between an emperor and a priest. It is not easy to find
a man capable of teaching me the truth. Ambrosius alone deserves the title of bishop.”</p>
<p>So great is the gain of conviction when brought home by a man of bright and shining
goodness.</p>

<p>Yet other opportunities of improvement lay within the emperor’s reach, for his wife
used constantly to put him in mind of the divine laws in which she had first carefully educated
herself. In no way exalted by her imperial rank she was rather fired by it with greater longing
for divine things. The greatness of the good gift given her made her love for Him who gave
it all the greater, so she bestowed every kind of attention on the maimed and the mutilated,
declining all aid from her household and her guards, herself visiting the houses where the
sufferers lodged, and providing every one with what he required. She also went about the
guest chambers of the churches and ministered to the wants of the sick, herself handling
pots and pans, and tasting broth, now bringing in a dish and breaking bread and offering
morsels, and washing out a cup and going through all the other duties which are supposed
to be proper to servants and maids. To them who strove to restrain her from doing these
things with her own hands she would say, “It befits a sovereign to distribute gold; I, for the
sovereign power that has been given me, am giving my own service to the Giver.” To her
husband, too, she was ever wont to say, “Husband, you ought always to bethink you what
you were once and what you have become now; by keeping this constantly in mind you will
never grow ungrateful to your benefactor, but will guide in accordance with law the empire
bestowed upon you, and thus you will worship Him who gave it.” By ever using language
of this kind, she with fair and wholesome care, as it were, watered the seeds of virtue planted
in her husband’s heart.</p>
<p>She died before her husband, and not long after the time of her death events occurred
which showed how well her husband loved her.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Of the sedition of Antioch.881</head>
<p>In consequence of his continual wars the emperor was compelled to impose heavy taxes
on the cities of the empire.882</p>
<p>The city of Antioch refused to put up with the new tax, and when the people saw the
victims of its exaction subjected to torture and indignity, then, in addition to the usual deeds
which a mob is wont to do when it is seizing an opportunity for disorder, they pulled down
the bronze statue of the illustrious Placilla, for so was the empress named, and dragged it
over a great part of the town.883 On being informed of these events the emperor, as was to
be expected, was indignant. He then deprived the city of her privileges, and gave her dignity
to her neighbour, with the idea that thus he could inflict on her the greatest indignity, for
Antioch from the earliest times had had a rival in Laodicea.884 He further threatened to
burn and destroy the town and reduce it to the rank of a village. The magistrates however
had arrested some men in the very act, and had put them to death before the tragedy came
to the emperor’s ears. All these orders had been given by the Emperor, but had not been
carried out because of the restriction imposed by the edict which had been made by the
advice of the great Ambrosius.885 On the arrival of the commissioners who brought the
emperor’s threats, Elebichus, then a military commander, and Cæsarius prefect of the palace,
styled by the Romans magister officiorum,886 the whole population shuddered in consternation.
But the athletes of virtue,887 dwelling at the foot of the hill, of whom at that time there
were many of the best, made many supplications and entreaties to the imperial officers. The
most holy Macedonius, who was quite unversed in the things of this life, and altogether ignorant
of the sacred oracles, living on the tops of the mountains, and night and day offering
up pure prayers to the Saviour of all, was not in the least dismayed at the imperial violence,
nor at all affected by the power of the commissioners. As they rode into the middle of the

town he caught hold of one of them by the cloak and bade both of them dismount. At the
sight of a little old man, clad in common rags, they were at first indignant, but some of those
who were conducting them informed them of the high character of Macedonius, and then
they sprang from their horses, caught hold of his knees, and asked his pardon. The old man,
urged on by divine wisdom, spoke to them in the following terms: “Say, dear sirs, to the
emperor; you are not only an emperor, you are also a man. Bethink you, therefore, not only
of your sovereignty, but also of your nature. You are a man, and you reign over your fellow
men. Now the nature of man is formed after the image and likeness of God. Do not, therefore,
thus savagely and cruelly order the massacre of God’s image, for by punishing His image
you will anger the Maker. Think how you are acting thus in your wrath for the sake of a
brazen image. Now all who are endued with reason know how far a lifeless image is inferior
to one alive and gifted with soul and sense. Take into account, too, that for one image of
bronze we can easily make many more. Even you yourself cannot make one single hair of
the slain.”</p>
<p>After the good men had heard these words they reported them to the emperor, and
quenched the flame of his rage. Instead of his threats he wrote a defence, and explained the
cause of his anger. “It was not right,” said he, “because I was in error, that indignity should
be inflicted after her death on a woman so worthy of the highest praise. They that were aggrieved
ought to have armed their anger against me.” The emperor further added that he
was grieved and distressed when he heard that some had been executed by the magistrates.
In relating these events I have had a twofold object. I did not think it right to leave in oblivion
the boldness of the illustrious monk, and I wished to point out the advantage of the edict
which was put out by the advice of the great Ambrosius.888</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Of the destruction of the temples all over the Empire.</head>
<p>Now the right faithful emperor diverted his energies to resisting paganism, and published
edicts in which he ordered the shrines of the idols to be destroyed. Constantine the Great,
most worthy of all eulogy, was indeed the first to grace his empire with true religion; and
when he saw the world still given over to foolishness he issued a general prohibition against
the offering of sacrifices to the idols. He had not, however, destroyed the temples, though
he ordered them to be kept shut. His sons followed in their father’s footsteps. Julian restored
the false faith and rekindled the flame of the ancient fraud. On the accession of Jovian he
once more placed an interdict on the worship of idols, and Valentinian the Great governed
Europe with like laws. Valens, however, allowed every one else to worship any way they
would and to honour their various objects of adoration. Against the champions of the
Apostolic decrees alone he persisted in waging war. Accordingly during the whole period
of his reign the altar fire was lit, libations and sacrifices were offered to idols, public feasts
were celebrated in the forum, and votaries initiated in the orgies of Dionysus ran about in
goat-skins, mangling hounds in Bacchic frenzy, and generally behaving in such a way as to
show the iniquity of their master. When the right faithful Theodosius found all these evils
he pulled them up by the roots, and consigned them to oblivion.889</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Of Marcellus, bishop of Apamea, and the idols’ temples destroyed by him.</head>
<p>The first of the bishops to put the edict in force and destroy the shrines in the city
committed to his care was Marcellus, trusting rather in God than in the hands of a multitude.
The occurrence is remarkable, and I shall proceed to narrate it. On the death of John, bishop
of Apamea, whom I have already mentioned, the divine Marcellus, fervent in spirit,890 according
to the apostolic law, was appointed in his stead.</p>
<p>Now there had arrived at Apamea the prefect of the East891 with two tribunes and their
troops. Fear of the troops kept the people quiet. An attempt was made to destroy the vast
and magnificent shrine of Jupiter, but the building was so firm and solid that to break up
its closely compacted stones seemed beyond the power of man; for they were huge and well
and truly laid, and moreover clamped fast with iron and lead.892</p>
<p>When the divine Marcellus saw that the prefect was afraid to begin the attack, he sent
him on to the rest of the towns; while he himself prayed to God to aid him in the work of
destruction. Next morning there came uninvited to the bishop a man who was no builder,
or mason, or artificer of any kind, but only a labourer who carried stones and timber on his
back. “Give me,” said he, “two workmen’s pay; and I promise you I will easily destroy the
temple.” The holy bishop did as he was asked, and the following was the fellow’s contrivance.
Round the four sides of the temple went a portico united to it, and on which its upper story
rested.893 The columns were of great bulk, commensurate with the temple, each being sixteen
cubits in circumference. The quality of the stone was exceptionally hard, and offering great
resistance to the masons’ tools. In each of these the man made an opening all round, propping
up the superstructure with olive timber before he went on to another. After he had hollowed
out three of the columns, he set fire to the timbers. But a black demon appeared and would
not suffer the wood to be consumed, as it naturally would be, by the fire, and stayed the
force of the flame. After the attempt had been made several times, and the plan was proved
ineffectual, news of the failure was brought to the bishop, who was taking his noontide sleep.
Marcellus forthwith hurried to the church, ordered water to be poured into a pail, and placed
the water upon the divine altar. Then, bending his head to the ground, he besought the
<note type="footnote">890 Romans xii. 11</note>

have bound the stones of the Colosseum,—the ruins being pitted all over by the holes made by the middle-age
pillagers who tore them away.</note>
<note type="footnote">893 I do not understand the description of this temple and its destruction precisely as Gibbon does. “διορύττων”
does not seem to mean “undermining the foundations”; St. Matthew and St. Luke use it of the thieves who “dig

loving Lord in no way to give in to the usurped power of the demon, but to lay bare its
weakness and exhibit His own strength, lest unbelievers should henceforth find excuse for
greater wrong. With these and other like words he made the sign of the cross over the water,
and ordered Equitius, one of his deacons, who was armed with faith and enthusiasm, to
take the water and sprinkle it in faith, and then apply the flame. His orders were obeyed,
and the demon, unable to endure the approach of the water, fled. Then the fire, affected by
its foe the water as though it had been oil, caught the wood, and consumed it in an instant.
When their support had vanished the columns themselves fell down, and dragged other
twelve with them. The side of the temple which was connected with the columns was dragged
down by the violence of their fall, and carried away with them. The crash, which was tremendous,
was heard throughout the town, and all ran to see the sight. No sooner did the
multitude hear of the flight of the hostile demon than they broke out into a hymn of praise
to God.</p>
<p>Other shrines were destroyed in like manner by this holy bishop. Though I have many
other most admirable doings of this holy man to relate,—for he wrote letters to the victorious
martyrs, and received replies from them, and himself won the martyr’s crown,—for the
present I hesitate to narrate them, lest by over prolixity I weary the patience of those into
whose hands my history may fall.</p>

of the idols in that city.</head>
<p>The illustrious Athanasius was succeeded by the admirable Petrus, Petrus by Timotheus,
and Timotheus by Theophilus, a man of sound wisdom and of a lofty courage.894 By him
Alexandria was set free from the error of idolatry; for, not content with razing the idols’
temples to the ground, he exposed the tricks of the priests to the victims of their wiles. For
they had constructed statues of bronze and wood hollow within, and fastened the backs of
them to the temple walls, leaving in these walls certain invisible openings. Then coming up
from their secret chambers they got inside the statues, and through them gave any order
they liked and the hearers, tricked and cheated, obeyed.895 These tricks the wise Theophilus
exposed to the people.</p>
<p>Moreover he went up into the temple of Serapis, which has been described by some as
excelling in size and beauty all the temples in the world.896 There he saw a huge image of
which the bulk struck beholders with terror, increased by a lying report which got abroad
that if any one approached it, there would be a great earthquake, and that all the people
would be destroyed. The bishop looked on all these tales as the mere drivelling of tipsy old
women, and in utter derision of the lifeless monster’s enormous size, he told a man who
had an axe to give Serapis a good blow with it.897 No sooner had the man struck, than all
the folk cried out, for they were afraid of the threatened catastrophe. Serapis however, who

the pagan idols were destroyed, faint traces of image worship begin to appear in the Church. In another two centuries

hand; the head and body of a serpent branching into three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads

deprived of his eyes and of his life?” “I want that man,” replied the clear sighted veteran, “and you now sup on

pieces of which some were committed to the flames, but his head was carried through all
the town in sight of his worshippers, who mocked the weakness of him to whom they had
bowed the knee.</p>
<p>Thus all over the world the shrines of the idols were destroyed.898</p>

Durham, there was found among the remains of an important Roman building a stone statue of the goddess
Flora, with its legs broken, lying face downward across a drain as a support to the masonry above. It would

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Of Flavianus bishop of Antioch and of the sedition which arose in the western
Church on account of Paulinus.</head>
<p>At Antioch the great Meletius had been succeeded by Flavianus who, together with Diodorus,
had undergone great struggles for the salvation of the sheep. Paulinus had indeed
desired to receive the bishopric, but he was withstood by the clergy on the ground that it
was not right that Meletius at his death should be succeeded by one who did not share his
opinions, and that to the care of the flock ought to be advanced he who was conspicuous
for many toils, and had run the risk of many perils for the sheeps’ sake. Thus a lasting hostility
arose among the Romans and the Egyptians against the East, and the ill feeling was
not even destroyed on the death of Paulinus. After him when Evagrius had occupied his
see, hostility was still shewn to the great Flavianus, notwithstanding the fact that the promotion
of Evagrius was a violation of the law of the Church, for he had been promoted by
Paulinus alone in disregard of many canons. For a dying bishop is not permitted to ordain
another to take his place, and all the bishops of a province are ordered to be convened; again
no ordination of a bishop is permitted to take place without three bishops. Nevertheless
they refused to take cognizance of any of these laws, embraced the communion of Evagrius,
and filled the ears of the emperor with complaints against Flavianus, so that, being frequently
importuned, he summoned him to Constantinople, and ordered him to repair to Rome.</p>
<p>Flavianus, however, urged in reply that it was now winter, and promised to obey the
command in spring. He then returned home. But when the bishops of Rome, not only the
admirable Damasus, but also Siricius his successor and Anastasius the successor of Siricius,
importuned the emperor more vehemently and represented that, while he put down the
rivals against his own authority, he suffered bold rebels against the laws of Christ to maintain
their usurped authority, then he sent for him again and tried to force him to undertake the
journey to Rome. On this Flavianus in his great wisdom spoke very boldly, and said, “If, sir,
there are some who accuse me of being unsound in the faith, or of life and conversation
unworthy of the priesthood, I will accept my accusers themselves for judges, and will submit
to whatever sentence they may give. But if they are contending about see and primacy I will
not contest the point; I will not oppose those who wish to take them; I will give way and
resign my bishopric. So, sir, give the episcopal throne of Antioch to whom you will.”</p>
<p>The emperor admired his manliness and wisdom, and bade him go home again, and
tend the church committed to his care.</p>
<p>After a considerable time had elapsed the emperor arrived at Rome, and once more
encountered the charges advanced by the bishops on the ground that he was making no attempt
to put down the tyranny of Flavianus. The emperor ordered them to set forth the
nature of the tyranny, saying that he himself was Flavianus and had become his protector.
The bishops rejoined that it was impossible for them to dispute with the emperor. He then
exhorted them in future to join the churches in concord, put an end to the quarrel, and

<pb n="341"/>
quench the fires of an useless controversy. Paulinus, he pointed out, had long since departed
this life; Evagrius had been irregularly promoted; the eastern churches accepted Flavianus
as their bishop. Not only the east but all Asia, Pontus, and Thrace were united in communion
with him, and all Illyricum recognised his authority over the oriental bishops. In submission
to these counsels the western bishops promised to bring their hostility to a close and to receive
the envoys who should be sent them.</p>
<p>When Flavianus had been informed of this decision he despatched to Rome certain
worthy bishops with presbyters and deacons of Antioch, giving the chief authority among
them to Acacius bishop of Beroea, who was famous throughout the world. On the arrival of
Acacius and his party at Rome they put an end to the protracted quarrel, and after a war of
seventeen years899 gave peace to the churches. When the Egyptians were informed of the
reconciliation they too gave up their opposition, and gladly accepted the agreement which
was made.</p>
<p>At that time Anastasius had been succeeded in the primacy of the Roman Church by
Innocent, a man of prudence and ready wit. Theophilus, whom I have previously mentioned,
held the see of Alexandria.900</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Of the tyranny of Eugenius and the victory won through faith by the Emperor
Theodosius.</head>
<p>In this manner the peace of the churches was secured by the most religious emperor.
Before the establishment of peace he had heard of the death of Valentinianus and of the
usurpation of Eugenius and had marched for Europe.901</p>
<p>At this time there lived in Egypt902 a man of the name of John, who had embraced the
ascetic life. Being full of spiritual grace, he foretold many future events to persons who from
time to time came to consult him. To him the Christ-loving emperor sent, in his anxiety to
know whether he ought to make war against the tyrants. In the case of the former war he
foretold a bloodless victory. In that of the second he predicted that the emperor would only
win after a great slaughter. With this expectation the emperor set out, and, while drawing
up his forces, shot down many of his opponents, but lost many of his barbarian allies.903</p>
<p>When his generals represented that the forces on their side were few and recommended
him to allow some pause in the campaign, so as to muster an army at the beginning of spring
and out-number the enemy, Theodosius refused to listen to their advice. “For it is wrong,”
said he, “to charge the Cross of Salvation with such infirmity, for it is the cross which leads
our troops, and attribute such power to the image of Hercules which is at the head of the
forces of our foe.” Thus in right faith he spoke, though the men left him were few in number
and much discouraged. Then when he had found a little oratory, on the top of the hill where
his camp was pitched, he spent the whole night in prayer to the God of all.</p>
<note type="footnote">901 Valentinian II. was strangled while bathing in the Rhine at Vienne, May 15, 392. Philost. xi. 1. cf. Soc. v.

and meanwhile his Empress Galla died, leaving a little daughter, Galla Placidia.</note>

<note type="footnote">903 “Theodosius marched north-westwards, as before, up the valley of the Save, and to the city of Æmona.”
(Laybach.) “Not there did he meet his foes, but at a place thirty miles off, half-way between Æmona and Aquileia,
where the Julian Alps are crossed, and where a little stream called the Frigidus, (now the Wipbach, or Vipao)
bursts suddenly from a limestone hill. Here the battle was joined between Eugenius and his Frankish patron
and Theodosius with his 20,000 Gothic foederati and the rest of the army of the East. Gainas, Saul, Bacurius,
Alaric, were the chief leaders of the Teutonic troops. The first day of battle fell heavily on the foederati of
Theodosius, half of whom were left dead upon the field.” Hodgkin Dynasty of Theodosius, p. 131. This was Sept.
5, 394.</note>

<pb n="343"/>
<p>About cock-crow sleep overcame him, and as he lay upon the ground he thought he
saw two men in white raiment riding upon white horses, who bade him be of good cheer,
drive away his fear, and at dawn arm and marshal his men for battle. “For,” said they, “we
have been sent to fight for you,” and one said, “I am John the evangelist,” and the other, “I
am Philip the apostle.”</p>
<p>After he had seen this vision the emperor ceased not his supplication, but pursued it
with still greater eagerness. The vision was also seen by a soldier in the ranks who reported
it to his centurion. The centurion brought him to the tribune, and the tribune to the general.
The general supposed that he was relating something new, and reported the story to the
emperor. Then said Theodosius, “Not for my sake has this vision been seen by this man,
for I have put my trust in them that promised me the victory. But that none may have supposed
me to have invented this vision, because of my eagerness for the battle, the protector
of my empire has given the information to this man too, that he may bear witness to the
truth of what I say when I tell you that first to me did our Lord vouchsafe this vision. Let us
then fling aside our fear. Let us follow our front rank and our generals. Let none weigh the
chance of victory by the number of the men engaged, but let every man bethink him of the
power of the leaders.”</p>
<p>He spoke in similar terms to his men, and after thus inspiring all his host with high
hope, led them down from the crest of the hill. The tyrant saw the army coming to attack
him from a distance, and then armed his forces and drew them up for battle. He himself
remained on some elevated ground, and said that the emperor was desirous of death, and
was coming into battle because he wished to be released from this present life: so he ordered
his generals to bring him alive and in chains. When the forces were drawn up in battle array
those of the enemy appeared by far the more numerous, and the tale of the emperor’s troops
might be easily told. But when both sides had begun to discharge their weapons the front
rank proved their promises true. A violent wind blew right in the faces of the foe, and diverted
their arrows and javelins and spears, so that no missile was of any use to them, and neither
trooper nor archer nor spearman was able to inflict any damage upon the emperor’s army.
Vast clouds of dust, too, were carried into their faces, compelling them to shut their eyes
and protect them from attack. The imperial forces on the other hand did not receive the
slightest injury from the storm, and vigorously attacked and slew the foe. The vanquished
then recognised the divine help given to their conquerors, flung away their arms, and begged
the emperor for quarter. Theodosius then yielded to their entreaty and had compassion on
them, and ordered them to bring the tyrant immediately before him. Eugenius was ignorant
of how the day had gone, and when he saw his men running up the hillock where he sat, all
out of breath, and shewing their eagerness by their panting, he took them for messengers
of victory, and asked if they had brought Theodosius in chains, as he had ordered. “No,”
said they, “we are not bringing him to you, but we are come to carry you off to him, for so

<pb n="344"/>
the great Ruler has ordained.” Even as they spoke they lifted him from his chariot, put chains
upon him, and carried him off thus fettered, and led away the vain boaster of a short hour
ago, now a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>The emperor reminded him of the wrongs he had done Valentinianus, of his usurped
authority, and of the wars which he had waged against the rightful emperor. He ridiculed
also the figure of Hercules and the foolish confidence it had inspired and at last pronounced
the sentence of right and lawful punishment.</p>
<p>Such was Theodosius in peace and in war, ever asking and never refused the help of
God.904</p>
<note type="footnote">904 Here was a crucial contest between paganism and Christianity, which might seem a “nodus dignus vindice
Deo.” On the part played by storms in history vide note on page 103. Claudian, a pagan, was content to acknowledge
the finger of providence in the rout of Eugenius, and apostrophizing Honorius, exclaims “Te propter
gelidis Aquilo de monte procellis Obruit adversas actes, revolutaque tela Vertit in auctores, et turbine repulit
hastas. O nimium dilecte Deo, cui fundit ab antris Æolus armatas hyemes; cui militat æther Et conjurati veniunt
ad classica venti.”—vii. 93 Augustine says he heard of the “revoluta tela” from a soldier engaged in the battle.
The appearance of St. John and St. Philip finds a pagan parallel in that of the “great twin brethren” at Lake Regillus.
“So like they were, no mortal Might one from other know: White as snow their armour was, Their steeds
were white as snow.” According to Spanish story St. James the Great fought on a milk-white charger, waving a
white flag, at the battle of Clavijo, in 939. cf. Mrs. Jameson Sacred and Legendary Art, i. 234. Sozomen (vii. 24)
relates how at the very hour of the fight, at the church which Theodosius had built near Constantinople to enshrine the
head of John the Baptist (cf. note on p. 96), a demoniac insulted the saint, taunting him with having had his head cut off,
and said “you conquer me and ensnare my army.” On this Jortin remarks “either the devil and Sozomen, or else Theodoret,
seem to have made a mistake, for the two first ascribe the victory to John the Baptist and the third to John the Evangelist.”

<head>Chapter XXV.—Of the death of the Emperor Theodosius.905</head>
<p>After this victory Theodosius fell sick and divided his empire between his sons, assigning
to the elder the sovereignty which he had wielded himself and to the younger the throne of
Europe.906</p>
<p>He charged both to hold fast to the true religion, “for by its means,” said he, “peace is
preserved, war is stopped, foes are routed, trophies are set up and victory is proclaimed.”
After giving this charge to his sons he died, leaving behind him imperishable fame.</p>
<p>His successors in the empire were also inheritors of his piety.</p>
<note type="footnote">905 Theodosius died of dropsy at Milan, Jan. 17, 395. “The character of Theodosius is one of the most perplexing
in history. The church historians have hardly a word of blame for him except in the matter of the massacre
of Thessalonica, and that seems to be almost atoned for in their eyes by its perpetrator’s penitent submission to
ecclesiastical censure. On the other hand the heathen historians, represented by Zosimus, condemn in the most
unmeasured terms his insolence, his love of pleasure, his pride, and hint at the scandalous immorality of his
life.” “It is the fashion to call him the Great, and we may admit that he has as good a right to that title as Lewis
XIV., a monarch whom in some respects he pretty closely resembles. But it seems to me that it would be safer
to withhold this title from both sovereigns, and to call them not the Great, but the Magnificent.” Hodgkin,
Dynasty of Theodosius. 133. The great champion of orthodoxy, he was no violent persecutor, and received at his death
from a grateful paganism the official honours of apotheosis.</note>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Of Honorius the emperor and Telemachus the monk.</head>
<p>Honorius, who inherited the empire of Europe, put a stop to the gladiatorial combats
which had long been held at Rome. The occasion of his doing so arose from the following
circumstance. A certain man of the name of Telemachus had embraced the ascetic life. He
had set out from the East and for this reason had repaired to Rome. There, when the abominable
spectacle was being exhibited, he went himself into the stadium, and, stepping down
into the arena, endeavoured to stop the men who were wielding their weapons against one
another. The spectators of the slaughter were indignant, and inspired by the mad fury of
the demon who delights in those bloody deeds, stoned the peacemaker to death.</p>
<p>When the admirable emperor was informed of this he numbered Telemachus in the
array of victorious martyrs, and put an end to that impious spectacle.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Of the piety of the emperor Arcadius and the ordination of John Chrysostom.</head>
<p>On the death at Constantinople of Nectarius, bishop of that see, Arcadius, who had
succeeded to the Eastern empire, summoned John, the great luminary of the world. He had
heard that he was numbered in the ranks of the presbyterate, and now issued orders to the
assembled bishops to confer on him divine grace, and appoint him shepherd of that mighty
city.907</p>
<p>This fact is alone sufficient to show the emperor’s care for divine things. At the same
time the see of Antioch was held by Flavianus, and that of Laodicea by Elpidius, who had
formerly been the comrade of the great Meletius, and had received the impress of his life
and conversation more plainly than wax takes the impression of a seal ring.908</p>
<p>He succeeded the great Pelagius;909 and the divine Marcellus910 was followed by the illustrious
Agapetus911 whom I have already described as conspicuous for high ascetic virtue.
In the time of the tempest of heresy, of Seleucia ad Taurum, Maximus,912 the companion
of the great John, was bishop, and of Mopsuestia Theodorus,913 both illustrious teachers.
Conspicuous, too, in wisdom and character was the holy Acacius,914 bishop of Beroea.</p>
<note type="footnote">907 Nectarius died in Sept. 397, and John Chrysostom was appointed in Feb. 398. cf. Soc. vi. 2 and Soz. viii.
2. “The only difficulty lay with Chrysostom himself and the people of Antioch. The double danger of a decided
‘nolo episcopari’ on Chrysostom’s part, and of a public commotion when the Antiocheans heard of the intention
of robbing them of their favourite preacher was overcome by stratagem. Asterius, the Comes Orientis, in accordance
with instructions received from Eutropius, induced Chrysostom to accompany him to a martyr’s chapel
outside the city walls. There he was apprehended by the officers of the government, and conveyed to Papae, the
first post station on the road to Constantinople. His remonstrances were unheeded; his enquiries met with obstinate
silence. Placed in a public chariot, and hurried on under a military escort from stage to stage, the 800
miles traversed with the utmost dispatch, the future bishop reached his imperial see a closely guarded prisoner.
However unwelcome the dignity thrust on him was, Chrysostom, knowing that resistance was useless, felt it
more dignified to submit without further struggle.” “Chrysostom was consecrated February 26th a.d. 398, in the
presence of a vast multitude assembled not only to witness the ceremony but also to listen to the inaugural sermon of
one of whose eloquence they had heard so much. This ‘sermo enthronisticus’ is lost.” Dict. Christ. Biog. s.v. “Chrysostom.”
908 Elpidius, possibly a kind of domestic chaplain (σύσκηνος) to Meletius, was afterwards a warm friend and
advocate of Chrysostom. In 406 he was deposed and imprisoned for three years, and not restored till 414.</note>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Of John’s boldness for God.</head>
<p>When the great John had received the tiller of the Church, he boldly convicted certain
wrong doers, made seasonable exhortations to the emperor and empress, and admonished
the clergy to live according to the laws laid down. Transgressors against these laws he forbade
to approach the churches, urging that they who shewed no desire to live the life of true
priests ought not to enjoy priestly honour. He acted with this care for the church not only
in Constantinople, but throughout the whole of Thrace, which is divided into six provinces,
and likewise of Asia, which is governed by eleven governors. Pontica too, which has a like
number of rulers with Asia, was happily brought by him under the same discipline.916</p>
<note type="footnote">916 Valesius points out that those commentators have been in error who have supposed Theodoretus to be
referring here to ecclesiastical divisions and officers. Chrysostom is here distinctly described as asserting and exercising
a jurisdiction over the civil “dioeceses” of Pontica, Asia, and Thrace. But the quasi patriarchate was at this time only
honorary. Only so late as at the recent council at Constantinople (381) had its bishop, previously under the metropolitan
of Perinthus, been declared to rank next after the bishop of Rome, the metropolitans of Alexandria and Antioch standing
next, but it was not till the Council of Chalcedon that the “dioeceses” of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace were formally subjected

required to pay the craftsmen and their assistants who were engaged in the work of destruction
was not taken by John from imperial resources, but he persuaded certain wealthy and
faithful women to make liberal contributions, pointing out to them how great would be the
blessing their generosity would win.</p>

he assigned a church to them,918 and by their means won many from their error. He used
frequently himself to visit it and preach there, using an interpreter who was skilled in both
languages, and he got other good speakers to do the same. This was his constant practice in
the city, and many of those who had been deceived he rescued by pointing out to them the
truth of the apostolic preaching.</p>

described the conversion of the Scythians, and begged that fit men for their instruction
might be sent.</p>
<p>On hearing that in our district919 some men were infected with the plague of Marcion

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Of the demand made by Gainas and of John Chrysostom’s reply.</head>
<p>One Gainas, a Scythian, but still more barbarous in character, and of cruel and violent
disposition, was at that time a military commander. He had under him many of his own
fellow-countrymen, and with them commanded the Roman cavalry and infantry. He was
an object of terror not only to all the rest but even to the emperor himself, who suspected
him of aiming at usurpation.</p>
<p>He was a participator in the Arian pest, and requested the emperor to grant him the use
of one of the churches. Arcadius replied that he would see to it and have it done. He then
sent for the divine John, told him of the request that had been made, reminded him of the
power of Gainas, hinted at the usurpation which was being aimed at, and besought him to
bridle the anger of the barbarian by this concession.921 “But,” said that noble man, “attempt,
sir, no such promise, nor order what is holy to be given to the dogs.922 I will never suffer
the worshippers and praisers of the Divine Word to be expelled and their church to be given
to them that blaspheme Him. Have no fear, sir, of that barbarian; call us both, me and him,
before you; listen in silence to what is said, and I will both curb his tongue and persuade
him not to ask what it is wrong to grant.”</p>
<p>The emperor was delighted with what Chrysostom said, and on the next day summoned
both the bishop and the general before him. Gainas began to request the fulfilment of the
promise, but the great John said in reply that the emperor, who professed the true religion,
had no right to venture on any act against it. Gainas rejoined that he also must have a place
to pray in. “Why,” said the great John, “every church is open to you, and nobody prevents
you from praying there when you are so disposed.” “But I,” said Gainas, “belong to another
sect, and I ask to have one church with them, and surely I who undergo so many toils in
war for Romans may fairly make such a request.” “But,” said the bishop, “you have greater
rewards for your labours, you are a general; you are vested in the consular robe, and you
must consider what you were formerly and what you are now—your indigence in the past
and your present prosperity; what kind of raiment you wore before you crossed the Ister,
and what you are robed in now. Consider, I say, the littleness of your labours and the
greatness of your rewards, and be not unthankful to them who have shewn you honour.”
With these words the teacher of the world silenced Gainas, and compelled him to stand
dumb. In process of time, however, he made known the rebellion which he had long had at
heart, gathered his forces in Thrace, and went out ravaging and plundering in very many
directions. At news of this there arose an universal panic among both princes and subjects,
<note type="footnote">921 The three great officials, Aurelianus, Saturninus, and the Count John had already surrendered themselves
to the arrogant Goth, and their lives had only been spared at the entreaty of Chrysostom.</note>

and no one was found willing to march against him; no one thought it safe to approach him

<p>Then when every one else was passed over because of the universal panic, this great
chief was persuaded to undertake the ambassage. He took no heed of the dispute which has
been related, nor of the ill feeling which it had engendered, and readily set out for Thrace.
No sooner did Gainas hear of the arrival of the envoy than he bethought him of the bold
utterance which he had made on behalf of true religion. He came eagerly from a great distance
to meet him, placed his right hand upon his eyes, and brought his children to his saintly
knees. So is it the nature of goodness to put even those who are most opposed to it to the
blush and vanquish them. But envy could not endure the bright rays of his philosophy. It
put in practice its wonted wiles and deprived of his eloquence and his wisdom the imperial
city—aye indeed the whole world.923</p>
<note type="footnote">923 It is not clear where the mission of Chrysostom to Gainas should be placed. Gainas attacked the capital

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Of the events which happened on account of Chrysostom.</head>
<p>At this part of my history I know not what sentiments to entertain; wishful as I am to
relate the wrong inflicted on Chrysostom, I yet regard in other respects the high character
of those who wronged him. I shall therefore do my best to conceal even their names.924
These persons had different reasons for their hostility, and were unwilling to contemplate
his brilliant virtue. They found certain wretches who accused him, and, perceiving the
openness of the calumny, held a meeting at a distance from the city and pronounced their
sentence.925</p>
<p>The emperor, who had confidence in the clergy, ordered him to be banished. So
Chrysostom, without having heard the charges brought against him, or brought forward
his defence, was forced as though convicted on the accusations advanced against him to
quit Constantinople,926 and departed to Hieron at the mouth of the Euxine, for so the naval
station is named.</p>
<p>In the night there was a great earthquake and the empress927 was struck with terror.
Envoys were accordingly sent at daybreak to the banished bishop beseeching him to return
without delay to Constantinople, and avert the peril from the town. After these another
party was sent and yet again others after them and the Bosphorus was crowded with the
couriers. When the faithful people learned what was going on they covered the mouth of
the Propontis with their boats, and the whole population lighted up waxen torches and came
forth to meet him. For the time indeed his banded foes were scattered.928</p>
<p>But after the interval of a few months they endeavoured to enact punishment, not for
the forged indictment, but for his taking part in divine service after his deposition. The

by the emperor, and by the emperor again recalled. Then another Synod met, and his opponents
did not ask for a trial, but persuaded the emperor that the sentence was lawful and
right. Chrysostom was then not merely banished, but relegated to a petty and lonely town
in Armenia of the name of Cucusus. Even from thence he was removed and deported to
Pityus, a place at the extremity of the Euxine and on the marches of the Roman Empire, in
the near neighbourhood of the wildest savages. But the loving Lord did not suffer the victorious
athlete to be carried off to this islet, for when he had reached Comana he was removed
to the life that knows nor age nor pain.929</p>
<p>The body that had struggled so bravely was buried by the side of the coffin of the martyred
Basiliscus, for so the martyr had ordained in a dream.</p>
<p>I think it needless to prolong my narrative by relating how many bishops were expelled
from the church on Chrysostom’s account, and sent to live in the ends of the earth, or how
many ascetic philosophers were involved in the same calamities, and all the more because
I think it needful to curtail these hideous details, and to throw a veil over the ill deeds of
men of the same faith as our own. Punishment however did fall on most of the guilty, and
their sufferings were a means of good to the rest. This great wrong was regarded with special
detestation by the bishops of Europe, who separated themselves from communion with the
guilty parties. In this action they were joined by all the bishops of Illyria. In the East most
of the cities shrank from participation in the wrong, but did not make a rent in the body of
the church.</p>

the communion of the bishops of Egypt, of the East, of the Bosphorus, and in Thrace, until
<note type="footnote">929 Theodoret omits the second offence to Eudoxia—his invectives on the dedication of her silver statue in
front of St. Sophia in Sept. 403. (Soc. vi. 18. Soz. viii. 20) “Once again Herodias runs wild; once again she dances;
once again she is in a hurry to get the head of John on a charger.” Or does the description of Herodias, and not
Salome, as dancing, indicate that the calumnious sentence was not really uttered by Chrysostom, but said to
have been uttered by informers whose knowledge of the Gospels was incomplete? The discourse “in decollationem
Baptistæ Joannis” is in Migne Vol. viii. 485, but it is generally rejected as spurious. The circumstances of the
deposition will be found in Palladius, and in Chrysostom’s Ep. ad Innocent. The edict was issued June 5, 404.
Cucusus (cf. p. ii. 4) is on the borders of Cilicia and Armenia Minor. Gibbon says the three years spent here
were the “most glorious of his life,” so great was the influence he wielded. In the winter of 405 he was driven with
other fugitives from Cucusus through fear of Isaurian banditti, and fled some 60 miles to Arabissus. Early in 406 he returned.
Eudoxia was dead (†Oct. 4, 404) but other enemies were impatient at the old man’s resistance to hardship. An
Edict was procured transferring the exile to Pityus, in the N.E. corner of the Black Sea (now Soukoum in Transcaucasia)
but Chrysostom’s strength was unequal to the cruel hardships of the journey. Some five miles from Comana in Pontus
(Tokat), clothed in white robes, he expired in the chapel of the martyred bishop Basiliskus, Sept. 14, 407. Basiliskus was
martyred in 312.</note>

<p>At this time the see of Alexandria was held by Cyril,931 brother’s son to Theophilus
whom he succeeded; at the same time Jerusalem was occupied by John932 in succession to
Cyril whom we have formerly mentioned. The Antiochenes were under the care of Alexander933
whose life and conversation were of a piece with his episcopate. Before his consecration
he passed his time in ascetic training and in hard bodily exercise. He was known as a noble
champion, teaching by word and confirming the word by deed. His predecessor was Porphyrius
who guided that church after Flavianus, and left behind him many memorials of
his loving character.934 He was also distinguished by intellectual power. The holy Alexander
was specially rich in self discipline and philosophy; his life was one of poverty and self
denial; his eloquence was copious and his other gifts were innumerable; by his advice and
exhortation, the following of the great Eustathius which Paulinus, and after him Evagrius,
had not permitted to be restored, was united to the rest of the body, and a festival was celebrated
the like of which none had ever seen before. The bishop gathered all the faithful together,
both clergy and laity, and marched with them to the assembly. The procession was accompanied
by musicians; one hymn was sung by all in harmony, and thus he and his company
went in procession from the western postern to the great church, filling the whole
forum with people, and constituting a stream of thinking living beings like the Orontes in
its course.</p>
<p>When this was seen by the Jews, by the victims of the Arian plague, and by the insignificant
remnant of Pagans, they set up a groaning and wailing, and were distressed at seeing
the rest of the rivers discharging their waters into the Church. By Alexander the name of
the great John was first inscribed in the records935 of the Church.</p>
<note type="footnote">931 Cyril occupied the Episcopal throne of Alexandria from 412 to 444. Theodoretus could not be expected

<p>At a later time the actual remains of the great doctor were conveyed to the imperial city,
and once again the faithful crowd turning the sea as it were into land by their close packed
boats, covered the mouth of the Bosphorus towards the Propontis with their torches. The
precious possession was brought into Constantinople by the present emperor,936 who received
the name of his grandfather and preserved his piety undefiled. After first gazing upon
the bier he laid his head against it, and prayed for his parents and for pardon on them who
had ignorantly sinned, for his parents had long ago been dead, leaving him an orphan in
extreme youth, but the God of his fathers and of his forefathers permitted him not to suffer
trial from his orphanhood, but provided for his nurture in piety, protected his empire from
the assaults of sedition, and bridled rebellious hearts. Ever mindful of these blessings he
honours his benefactor with hymns of praise. Associated with him in this divine worship
are his sisters,937 who have maintained virginity throughout their lives, thinking the study
of the divine oracles938 the greatest delight, and reckoning that riches beyond robbers’ reach
are to be found in ministering to the poor. The emperor himself was adorned by many
<note type="footnote">sometimes erased from unworthy motives. A survival of the use obtains in the English Church in the Prayer for
the Church Militant, and more specifically in the recitation of names in the Bidding Prayer.</note>
<note type="footnote">936 Theodosius II. succeeded his father May 1, 408, at the age of eight. The translation of the remains of
Chrysostom took place at the beginning of 438. Theodosius died in 450, and the phrase “ὁ νῦν βασιλεὺων” thus
limits the composition of the History. As however Theodoret does not continue his list of bishops of Rome after
Cælestinus, who died in 440, we may conclude that the History was written in 438–439. But the mention of Isdigirdes
II. in Chap. xxxviii. carries us somewhat further. Possibly the portions of the work were jotted down
from time to time.</note>
<note type="footnote">937 Theodosius II. had four sisters, Flaccilla, Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina. Pulcheria was practically
empress-regnant for a considerable period. She was only two years older than her brother, but was declared
Augusta and empress July 14, 414, at the age of 15½. On his death in 450 she married Marcianus a general. Besides

“῾Εβραϊδι διαλέκτῳ τὰ λόγια συνεγράψατο.” Pulcheria and her sisters did not study the Scriptures, but only
“the divine discourses,” to the exclusion of anything that was not a discourse. cf. Salmon Introduction to the N.
T. 4th Ed. pp. 95, 96, and Bp. Lightfoot’s Essays in reply to the anonymous author of “Supernatural Religion.”

graces, and not least by his kindness and clemency, an unruffled calm of soul and a faith as
undefiled as it is notorious. Of this I will give an undeniable proof.</p>
<p>A certain ascetic somewhat rough of temper came to the emperor with a petition. He
came several times without attaining his object, and at last excommunicated the emperor
and left him under his ban. The faithful emperor returned to his palace, and as it was the
time for the banquet, and his guests were assembled, he said that he could not partake of
the entertainment before the interdict was taken off. On this account he sent the most intimate
of his suite to the bishop, beseeching him to order the imposer of the interdict to remove
it. The bishop replied that an interdict ought not to be accepted from every one, and pronounced
it not binding, but the emperor refused to accept this remission until the imposer
of it had after much difficulty been discovered, and had restored the communion withdrawn.
So obedient was he to divine laws.</p>
<p>In accordance with the same principles he ordered a complete destruction of the remains
of the idolatrous shrines, that our posterity might be saved from the sight of even a trace of
the ancient error, this being the motive which he expressed in the edict published on the
subject. Of this good seed sown he is ever reaping the fruits, for he has the Lord of all on his
side. So when Rhoïlas,939 Prince of the Scythian Nomads, had crossed the Danube with a
vast host and was ravaging and plundering Thrace, and was threatening to besiege the imperial
city, and summarily seize it and deliver it to destruction, God smote him from on
high with thunderbolt and storm, burning up the invader and destroying all his host. A
similar providence was shewn, too, in the Persian war. The Persians received information
that the Romans were occupied elsewhere, and so in violation of the treaty of Peace, marched
against their neighbours, who found none to aid them under the attack, because, in reliance
on the Peace, the emperor had despatched his generals and his men to other wars. Then the
further march of the Persians was stayed by a very violent storm of rain and hail; their horses
refused to advance; in twenty days they had not succeeded in advancing as many furlongs.
Meanwhile the generals returned and mustered their troops.</p>
<p>In the former war, too, these same Persians, when besieging the emperor’s eponymous
city,940 were providentially rendered ridiculous. For after Vararanes941 had beset the
aforesaid city for more than thirty days with all his forces, and had brought up many helepoles,
and employed innumerable engines, and built up lofty towers outside the wall, resist-

ance was offered, and the assault of the attacking engines repelled, by the bishop Eunomius
alone. Our men had refused to fight against the foe, and were shrinking from bringing aid
to the besieged, when the bishop, by opposing himself to them, preserved the city from being
taken. When one of the barbarian chieftains ventured on his wonted blasphemy, and with
words like those of Rabshakeh and Sennacherib, madly threatened to burn the temple of
God, the holy bishop could not endure his furious wrath, but himself commanded a balista,942
which went by the name of the Apostle Thomas, to be set up upon the battlements, and a
mighty stone to be adjusted to it. Then, in the name of the Lord who had been blasphemed,
he gave the word to let go,—down crashed the stone on that impious chief and hit him on
his wicked mouth, and crushed in his face, and broke his head in pieces, and sprinkled his
brains upon the ground. When the commander of the army who had hoped to take the city
saw what was done, he confessed himself beaten and withdrew, and in his alarm made peace.</p>
<p>Thus the universal sovereign protects the faithful emperor, for he clearly acknowledges
whose slave he is, and performs fitting service to his Master.943</p>

there was an earthwork called “The Twelve Apostles.” (Kinglake, Crimea, Vol. iv. p. 48.) St. Thomas was the

In some respects like our Edward the Confessor and Henry VI. he had, in the words of Leo, “the heart of a priest
as well as of an emperor.” “He had fifteen prime ministers in twenty-five years, the last of whom, the Eunuch
Chrysaphius, retained his power for the longest period. a.d. 443–450. During that time the empire was rapidly
hurrying to destruction. The Vandals in Africa and the Huns under Attila in Europe were ravaging some of his
fairest provinces while the emperor was attending to palace intrigues.…Chrysaphius made him favourable to
Eutyches, and thus largely contributed to the establishment of the monophysite heresy.” Dr. Stokes in Dict.

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—Of the persecutions in Persia and of them that were martyred there.</head>
<p>At this time Isdigirdes,948 King of the Persians, began to wage war against the churches
and the circumstances which caused him so to do were as follows. A certain bishop, Abdas
by name,949 adorned with many virtues, was stirred with undue zeal and destroyed a Pyreum,
Pyreum being the name given by the Persians to the temples of the fire which they regarded
as their God.950</p>
<p>On being informed of this by the Magi Isdigirdes sent for Abdas and first in moderate
language complained of what had taken place and ordered him to rebuild the Pyreum.</p>
<p>This the bishop, in reply, positively refused to do, and thereupon the king threatened
to destroy all the churches, and in the end carried out all his threats, for first he gave orders
for the execution of that holy man and then commanded the destruction of the churches.
Now I am of opinion that to destroy the Pyreum was wrong and inexpedient, for not even
the divine Apostle, when he came to Athens and saw the city wholly given to idolatry, destroyed
any one of the altars which the Athenians honoured, but convicted them of their ignorance
by his arguments, and made manifest the truth. But the refusal to rebuild the fallen
temple, and the determination to choose death rather than so do, I greatly praise and honour,
and count to be a deed worthy of the martyr’s crown; for building a shrine in honour of the
fire seems to me to be equivalent to adoring it.</p>
<p>From this beginning arose a tempest which stirred fierce and cruel waves against the
nurslings of the true faith, and when thirty years had gone by the agitation still remained
kept up by the Magi, as the sea is kept in commotion by the blasts of furious winds. Magi
is the name given by the Persians to the worshippers of the sun and moon951 but I have
exposed their fabulous system in another treatise and have adduced solutions of their difficulties.</p>

<pb n="365"/>
<p>On the death of Isdigirdes, Vararanes, his son, inherited at once the kingdom and the
war against the faith, and dying in his turn left them both together to his son.952 To relate
the various kinds of tortures and cruelties inflicted on the saints is no easy task. In some
cases the hands were flayed, in others the back; of others they stripped the heads of skin
from brow to beard; others were enveloped in split reeds with the cut part turned inwards
and were surrounded with tight bandages from head to foot; then each of the reeds was
dragged out by force, and, tearing away the adjacent portions of the skin, caused severe
agony; pits were dug and carefully greased in which quantities of mice were put; then they
let down the martyrs, bound hand and foot, so as not to be able to protect themselves from
the animals, to be food for the mice, and the mice, under stress of hunger, little by little devoured
the flesh of the victims, causing them long and terrible suffering. By others sufferings
were endured even more terrible than these, invented by the enemy of humanity and the
opponent of the truth, but the courage of the martyrs was unbroken, and they hastened
unbidden in their eagerness to win that death which ushers men into indestructible life.</p>
<p>Of these I will cite one or two to serve as examples of the courage of the rest. Among
the noblest of the Persians was one called Hormisdas, by race an Achæmenid953 and the
son of a Prefect. On receiving information that he was a Christian the king summoned him
and ordered him to abjure God his Saviour. He replied that the royal orders were neither
right nor reasonable, “for he,” so he went on, “who is taught to find no difficulty in spurning
and denying the God of all, will haply the more easily despise a king who is a man of mortal
nature; and if, sir, he who denies thy sovereignty is deserving of the severest punishment,
how much more terrible a chastisement is not due to him who denies the Creator of the
world?” The king ought to have admired the wisdom of what was said, but, instead of this,
he stripped the noble athlete of his wealth and rank, and ordered him to go clad in nothing
save a loin cloth, and drive the camels of the army. After some days had gone by, as he looked
out of his chamber, he saw the excellent man scorched by the rays of the sun, and covered
with dust, and he bethought him of his father’s illustrious rank, and sent for him, and told
him to put on a tunic of linen. Then thinking the toil he had suffered, and the kindness
shewn him, had softened his heart, “Now at least,” said he “give over your opposition, and
deny the carpenter’s son.” Full of holy zeal Hormisdas tore the tunic and flung it away saying,
“If you think that this will make one give up the true faith, keep your present with your false
belief.” When the king saw how bold he was he drove him naked from the palace.</p>
<p>One Suenes, who owned a thousand slaves, resisted the King, and refused to deny his
master. The King therefore asked him which of his slaves was the vilest, and to this slave

<pb n="366"/>
handed over the ownership of all the rest, and gave him Suenes to be his slave. He also gave
him in marriage Suenes’ wife, supposing that thus he could bend the will of the champion
of the truth. But he was disappointed, for he had built his house upon the rock.954</p>
<p>The king also seized and imprisoned a deacon of the name of Benjamin. After two years
there came an envoy from Rome, to treat of other matters, who, when he was informed of
this imprisonment, petitioned the king to release the deacon. The king ordered Benjamin
to promise that he would not attempt to teach the Christian religion to any of the Magi, and
the envoy exhorted Benjamin to obey, but Benjamin, after he heard what the envoy had to
say, replied, “It is impossible for me not to impart the light which I have received; for how
great a penalty is due for the hiding of our talent is taught in the history of the holy gospels.”
955 Up to this time the King had not been informed of this refusal and ordered him
to be set free. Benjamin continued as he was wont seeking to catch them that were held
down by the darkness of ignorance, and bringing them to the light of knowledge. After a
year information of his conduct was given to the king, and he was summoned and ordered
to deny Him whom he worshipped. He then asked the king “What punishment should be
assigned to one who should desert his allegiance and prefer another?” “Death and torture,”
said the king. “How then” continued the wise deacon “should he be treated who abandons
his Maker and Creator, makes a God of one of his fellow slaves, and offers to him the honour
due to his Lord?” Then the king was moved with wrath, and had twenty reeds pointed, and
driven into the nails of his hands and feet. When he saw that Benjamin took this torture for
child’s play, he pointed another reed and drove it into his privy part and by working it up
and down caused unspeakable agony. After this torture the impious and savage tyrant
ordered him to be impaled upon a stout knotted staff, and so the noble sufferer gave up the

but we must not be astonished that the Lord of all endures their savagery and impiety, for
indeed before the reign of Constantine the Great all the Roman emperors wreaked their
wrath on the friends of the truth, and Diocletian, on the day of the Saviour’s passion, destroyed
the churches throughout the Roman Empire, but after nine years had gone by they
rose again in bloom and beauty many times larger and more splendid than before, and he
and his iniquity perished.956</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—Of Theodorus, bishop of Mopsuestia.</head>
<p>When the divine Theodorus was ruling the church of Antioch, Theodorus, bishop of
Mopsuestia, a doctor of the whole church and successful combatant against every heretical
phalanx, ended this life. He had enjoyed the teaching of the great Diodorus, and was the
friend and fellow-worker of the holy John, for they both together benefited by the spiritual
draughts given by Diodorus. Six-and-thirty years he had spent in his bishopric, fighting
against the forces of Arius and Eunomius, struggling against the piratical band of Apollinarius,
and finding the best pasture for God’s sheep.957 His brother Polychronius958 was the
excellent bishop of Apamea, a man gifted with great eloquence and of illustrious character.</p>
<p>I shall now make an end of my history, and shall entreat those who meet with it to requite
my labour with their prayers. The narrative now embraces a period of 105 years, beginning
from the Arian madness and ending with the death of the admirable Theodorus and
Theodotus.959 I will give a list of the bishops of great cities after the persecution.</p>

<head>DIALOGUES.
The “Eranistes”965 or “Polymorphus”966 of the Blessed Theodoretus,
Bishop of Cyrus.</head>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<head>Prologue.</head>
<p>Some men, distinguished neither by family nor education, and without any of the honourable
notoriety that comes of an upright life, are ambitious of achieving fame by wicked
ways. Of these was the famous Alexander, the coppersmith,967 a man of no sort of distinction
at all,—no nobility of birth, no eloquence of speech, who never led a political party nor an
army in the field; who never played the man in fight, but plied from day to day his ignominious
craft, and won fame for nothing but his mad violence against Saint Paul.</p>
<p>Shimei,968 again, an obscure person of servile rank, has become very renowned for his
audacious attack on the holy David.</p>
<p>It is said too that the originator of the Manichæan heresy was a mere whipping-block
of a slave, and, from love of notoriety, composed his execrable and superstitious writings.</p>
<p>The same line of conduct is pursued by many now, who after turning their backs on
the honourable glory of virtue on account of the toil to be undergone ere it be won, purchase
to themselves the notoriety that comes of shame and disgrace. For through eagerness to
pose as champions of new doctrines they pick up and get together the impiety of many
heresies, and compile this heresy of death.</p>
<p>Now I will endeavour briefly to dispute with them, with the double object of curing
them, if I can, of their unsoundness, and of giving a word of warning to the whole.</p>
<note type="footnote">965 ἔρανος—a meal to which every one contributes a share; a club feast, or pic-nic, and ἐρανιστὴς is in classical
Greek a contributor to such a feast. But ἐρανίζω = (α) “contribute,” and (β) “beg for contributions.” So
ἐρανιστὴς is by some rendered “beggar.” The idea of Theodoretus seems rather that his worse character is a
picker up of various scraps of heresy from different quarters, and this explanation of the name is borne out by
his use of the cognate verb ἐρανιζομαι in reference to the selection by Audæus of some of the doctrines of Manes
in Hist. iv. 9.</note>

<p>I call my work “Eranistes, or Polymorphus,” for, after getting together from many unhappy
sources their baleful doctrines, they produce their patchwork and incongruous conceit.
For to call our Lord Christ God only is the way of Simon, of Cerdo, of Marcion,969 and of
others who share this abominable opinion.</p>
<p>The acknowledgment of His birth from a Virgin, but coupled with the assertion that
this birth was merely a process of transition, and that God the Word took nothing of the
Virgin’s nature, is stolen from Valentinus and Bardesanes and the adherents of their fables.970
To call the godhead and the manhood of the Lord Christ one nature is the error filched
from the follies of Apollinarius.971</p>
<p>Again the attribution of capacity of suffering to the divinity of the Christ is a theft from
the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius. Thus the main principle of their teaching is like
beggars’ gabardines—a cento of ill-matched rags.</p>
<p>So I call this work Eranistes or Polymorphus. I shall write it in the form of a dialogue
with questions and answers, propositions, solutions, and antitheses, and all else that a dialogue
ought to have. I shall not insert the names of the questioners and respondents in the body
of the dialogue as did the wise Greeks of old, but I shall write them at the side at the beginning
of the paragraphs. They, indeed, put their writings in the hands of readers highly and variously
educated, and to whom literature was life. I, on the contrary, wish the reading of what
I write, and the discovery of whatever good it may give, to be an easy task, even to the illiterate.
This I think will be facilitated if the characters of the interlocutors are plainly shown
by their names in the margin, so the disputant who argues on behalf of the apostolical decrees
is called “Orthodoxos,” and his opponent “Eranistes.” A man who is fed by the charity of
many we commonly call “Beggar;” a man who knows how to get money together we call a
“Chrematistes.” So we have given our disputant this name from his character and pursuits.</p>
<p>I beg that all those into whose hands my book may fall will lay aside all preconceived
opinion and put the truth to the test. For clearness’ sake I will divide my book into three
dialogues. The first will contain the contention that the Godhead of the only-begotten Son

reign of Antoninus, a.d. 138–161, is described by the Ps. Tertullian as denying that Christ came in the substance
of the flesh, but in appearance only. According to Marcion the greater follower of Cerdo, Christ was not born
at all, but came down from heaven to Capernaum a.d. 29, his body being an appearance and his death an illusion.
Simon Magus, the “father of all heretics” of Irenæus (adv. Hær. pr. in lib. iii.) is apparently quoted rather as the
supposed originator of Gnosticism, than from any definite knowledge of his tenets.</note>

is immutable. The second will by God’s help show that the union of the Godhead and the
manhood of the Lord Christ is without confusion. The third will contend for the impassibility
of the divinity of our saviour. After these three disputations we will subjoin several
others as it were to complete them, giving formal proof under each head, and making it
perfectly plain that the apostles’ doctrine is preserved by us.</p>

<head>Dialogue I.—The Immutable.
Orthodoxos and Eranistes.</head>
<p>Orth.—Better were it for us to agree and abide by the apostolic doctrine in its purity.
But since, I know not how, you have broken the harmony, and are now offering us new
doctrines, let us, if you please, with no kind of quarrel, investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Eran.—We need no investigation, for we exactly hold the truth.</p>
<p>Orth.—This is what every heretic supposes. Aye, even Jews and Pagans reckon that they
are defending the doctrines of the truth; and so also do not only the followers of Plato and
Pythagoras, but Epicureans too, and they that are wholly without God or belief. It becomes
us, however, not to be the slaves of a priori assumption, but to search for the knowledge of
the truth.</p>
<p>Eran.—I admit the force of what you say and am ready to act on your suggestion.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since then you have made no difficulty in yielding to this my preliminary exhortation,
I ask you in the next place not to suffer the investigation of the truth to depend
on the reasonings of men, but to track the footprints of the apostles and prophets, and saints
who followed them. For so wayfarers when they wander from the high-road are wont to
consider well the pathways, if haply they shew any prints of men or horses or asses or mules
going this way or that, and when they find any such they trace the tracks as dogs do and
leave them not till once more they are in the right road.</p>
<p>Eran.—So let us do. Lead on yourself, as you began the discussion.</p>
<p>Orth—Let us, therefore, first make careful and thorough investigation into the divine
names,—I mean substance, and essences, and persons and proprieties, and let us learn and
define how they differ the one from the other. Then let us thus handle afterwards what follows.</p>
<p>Eran.—You give us a very admirable and proper introduction to our argument. When
these points are clear, our discussion will go forward without let or obstacle.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since we have decided then that this must be our course of procedure, tell me,
my friend, do we acknowledge one substance of God, alike of Father and of the only begotten
Son and of the Holy Ghost, as we have been taught by Holy Scripture, both Old and New,
and by the Fathers in Council in Nicæa, or do we follow the blasphemy of Arius?</p>
<p>Eran.—We confess one substance of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Orth.—And do we reckon hypostasis to signify anything else than substance, or do we
take it for another name of substance?</p>
<p>Eran.—Is there any difference between substance and hypostasis?972</p>
<note type="footnote">972 Cf. note p. 36, History.</note>

<pb n="375"/>
<p>Orth—In extra Christian philosophy there is not, for οὐσία signifies τὸ ὄν, that which
is, and ὑπόστασις that which subsists. But according to the doctrine of the Fathers there is
the same difference between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις as between the common and the particular,
and the species and the individual.</p>
<p>Eran.—Tell me more clearly what is meant by race or kind, and species and individual.</p>
<p>Orth.—We speak of race or kind with regard to the animal, for it means many things
at once. It indicates both the rational and the irrational; and again there are many species
of irrational, creatures that fly, creatures that are amphibious, creatures that go on foot, and
creatures that swim. And of these species each is marked by many subdivisions; of creatures
that go on foot there is the lion, the leopard, the bull, and countless others. So, too, of flying
creatures and the rest there are many species; yet all of them, though the species are the
aforesaid, belong to one and the same animal race. Similarly the name man is the common
name of mankind; for it means the Roman, the Athenian, the Persian, the Sauromatian,973
the Egyptian, and, in a word, all who are human, but the name Paulus or Petrus does not
signify what is common to the kind but some particular man; for no one on hearing of Paul
turns in thought to Adam or Abraham or Jacob, but thinks of him alone whose name he
has heard. But if he hears the word man simply, he does not fix his mind on the individual,
but bethinks him of the Indian, the Scythian, and the Massagete, and of all the race of men
together, and we learn this not only from nature, but also from Holy Scripture, for God said,
we read, “I will destroy man from the face of the earth,”974 and this he spake of countless
multitudes, and when more than two thousand and two hundred years had gone by after
Adam, he brought universal destruction on men through the flood, and so the blessed
David says: “Man that is in honour and understandeth not,”975 accusing not one here nor
one there, but all men in common. A thousand similar examples might be found, but we
must not be tedious.</p>
<p>Eran.—The difference between the common and the proper is shewed clearly. Now let
us return to discussion about οὐσία and ὑπόστασις</p>
<p>Orth.—As then the name man is common to human nature, so we understand the divine
substance to indicate the Holy Trinity; but the hypostasis denotes any person, as the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost; for, following the definitions of the Holy Fathers, we say that
hypostasis and individuality mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Eran.—We agree that this is so.</p>
<note type="footnote">973 “Sauromatas gentes Scytharum Græci vocant, quos Sarmatas Romani.” Pliny iii.</note>
<note type="footnote">974 Gen. vi. 7</note>
<note type="footnote">975 Ps. xlix. 20</note>

<pb n="376"/>
<p>Orth.—Whatever then is predicated of the divine nature is common both to the Father,
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, as for instance “God,” “Lord,” “Creator,” “Almighty,”
and so forth.</p>
<p>Eran.—Without question these words are common to the Trinity.</p>
<p>Orth.—But all that naturally denotes the hypostasis ceases to be common to the Holy
Trinity, and denotes the hypostasis to which it is proper, as, for instance, the names “Father,”
“Unbegotten,” are peculiar to the Father; while again the names “Son,” “Only Begotten,”
“God the Word,” do not denote the Father, nor yet the Holy Ghost, but the Son, and the
words “Holy Ghost,” “Paraclete,” naturally denote the hypostasis of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Eran.—But does not Holy Scripture call both the Father and the Son “Spirit”?</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes, it calls both the Father and the Son “Spirit,” signifying by this term the incorporeal
illimitable character of the divine nature. The Holy Scripture only calls the hypostasis
of the Spirit “Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>Eran.—This is indisputable.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since then we assert that some terms are common to the Holy Trinity, and some
peculiar to each hypostasis, do we assert the term “immutable” to be common to the substance
or peculiar to any hypostasis?</p>
<p>Eran.—The term “immutable” is common to the Trinity, for it is impossible for part of
the substance to be mutable and part immutable.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have well said, for as the term mortal is common to mankind, so are “immutable”
and “invariable” to the Holy Trinity. So the only-begotten Son is immutable, as
are both the Father that begat Him and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Eran.—Immutable.</p>
<p>Orth.—How then do you advance the statement in the gospel “the word became flesh,”976
and predicate mutation of the immutable nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—We assert Him to have been made flesh not by mutation, but as He Himself
knows.</p>
<p>Orth.—If He is not said to have become flesh by taking flesh, one of two things must be
asserted, either that he underwent the mutation into flesh, or was only so seen in appearance,
and in reality was God without flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is the doctrine of the disciples of Valentinus, Marcion, and of the Manichees,
but we have been taught without dispute that the divine Word was made flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—But in what sense do you mean “was made flesh”? “Took flesh,” or “was changed
into flesh”?</p>
<p>Eran.—As we have heard the evangelist say, “the word was made flesh.”</p>
<p>Orth.—In what sense do you understand “was made”?</p>
<note type="footnote">976 John i. 14</note>

<pb n="377"/>
<p>Eran.—He who underwent mutation into flesh was made flesh, and, as I said just now,
as He knows. But we know that with Him all things are possible,977 for He changed the
water of the Nile into blood, and day into night, and made the sea dry land, and filled the
dry wilderness with water, and we hear the prophet saying “Whatsoever the Lord pleased
that did He in heaven, and in earth, in the seas and all deep places.”978</p>
<p>Orth.—The creature is transformed by the Creator as He will, for it is mutable and obeys
the nod of Him that fashioned it. But His nature is immutable and invariable, wherefore of
the creature the prophet saith “He that maketh and transformeth all things.”979 But of the
divine Word the great David says “Thou art the same and thy years shall not fail.”980 And
again the same God says of Himself “For I am the Lord and I change not.”981</p>
<p>Eran.—What is hidden ought not to “be enquired into.”</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor yet what is plain to be altogether ignored.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am not aware of the manner of the incarnation. I have heard that the Word
was made flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—If He was made flesh by mutation He did not remain what He was before, and
this is easily intelligible from several analogies. Sand, for instance, when it is subjected to
heat, first becomes fluid, then is changed and congealed into glass, and at the time of the
change alters its name, for it is no longer called sand but glass.</p>
<p>Eran.—So it is.</p>
<p>Orth.—And while we call the fruit of the vine grape, when once we have pressed it, we
speak of it no longer as grape, but as wine.</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the wine itself, after it has undergone a change, it is our custom to name
no longer wine, but vinegar.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And similarly stone when burnt and in solution is no longer called stone, but
lime. And innumerable other similar instances might be found where mutation involves a
change of name.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>

<note type="footnote">979 The reference in Schulze’s edition is to Jeremiah x. 16, but here the Septuagint ὁ πλάσας τὰ πάντα does

<p>Orth.—If therefore you assert that the Divine Word underwent the change in the flesh,
why do you call Him God and not flesh? for change of name fits in with the alteration of
nature. For if where the things which undergo change have some relation to their former
condition (for there is a certain approximation of vinegar to wine and of wine to the fruit
of the vine, and of glass to sand) they receive another name after their alteration, how, where
the difference between them is infinite and as wide as that which divides a gnat from the
whole visible and invisible creation (for so wide, nay much wider, is the difference between
the nature of flesh and of Godhead) is it possible for the same name to obtain after the
change?</p>
<p>Eran.—I have said more than once that He was made flesh not by mutation, but continuing
still to be what He was, He was made what He was not.</p>
<p>Orth.—But unless this word “was made” becomes quite clear it suggests mutation and
alteration, for unless He was made flesh by taking flesh He was made flesh by undergoing
mutation.</p>
<p>Eran.—But the word “take” is your own invention. The Evangelist says the Word was
made flesh.982</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem either to be ignorant of the sacred Scripture, or to do it wrong knowingly.</p>
<p>Now if you are ignorant, I will teach you; if you are doing wrong, I will convict you.</p>
<p>Answer then; do you acknowledge the teaching of the divine Paul to be of the Spirit?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And do you allow that the same Spirit wrought through both Evangelists and
Apostles?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, for so have I learnt from the Apostolic Scripture “There are diversities of
gifts but the same spirit,”983 and again “All these things worketh that one and the selfsame
spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will,”984 and again “Having the same Spirit of
the Faith.”985</p>
<p>Orth.—Your introduction of the apostolic testimony is in season. If we assert that the
instruction alike of the evangelists and of the apostles is of the same spirit, listen how the
apostle interprets the words of the Gospel, for in the Epistle to the Hebrews he says, “Verily
he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham.”986 Now
tell me what you mean by the seed of Abraham. Was not that which was naturally proper
to Abraham proper also to the seed of Abraham?</p>

<p>Eran.—No; not without exception, for Christ did no sin.</p>
<p>Orth.—Sin is not of nature, but of corrupt will.987 On this very account, therefore, I did
not say indefinitely what Abraham had, but what he had according to nature, that is to say,
body and reasonable soul. Now tell me plainly; will you acknowledge that the seed of Abraham
was endowed with body and reasonable soul? If not, in this point you agree with the
ravings of Apollinarius. But I will compel you to confess this by other means. Tell me now;
had the Jews a body and a reasonable soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course they had.</p>
<p>Orth.—So when we hear the prophet saying, “But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob
whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,”988 are we to understand the Jews to
be bodies only? Are we not to understand them to be men consisting of bodies and souls?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the seed of Abraham not without soul nor yet intelligence, but with
everything which characterizes the seed of Abraham?</p>
<p>Eran.—He who so says puts forward two sons.</p>
<p>Orth.—But he who says that the Divine Word is changed into the flesh does not even
acknowledge one Son, for mere flesh by itself is not a son; but we confess one Son who took
upon Him the seed of Abraham, according to the divine apostle, and wrought the salvation
of mankind. But if you do not accept the apostolic preaching, say so openly.</p>
<p>Eran.—But we maintain that the utterances of the apostles are inconsistent, for there
appears to be a certain inconsistency between “the Word was made flesh” and “took upon
Him the seed of Abraham.”</p>
<p>Orth.—It is because you lack intelligence, or because you are arguing for arguing’s sake,
that the consistent seems inconsistent. It does not so appear to men who use sound reasoning;
for the divine apostle teaches that the Divine Word was made Flesh, not by mutation, but
by taking on Him the seed of Abraham. At the same time, too, he recalls the promise given
to Abraham. Or do you not remember the promises given to the Patriarch by the God of
the Universe?</p>
<p>Eran.—What promises?</p>
<p>Orth.—When He brought him out of his father’s house, and ordered him to come into
Palestine, did He not say to him “I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee, and in thy seed989 shall all families of the earth be blessed”?</p>

<p>Eran.—I remember these promises.</p>
<p>Orth.—Remember, too, the covenants made by God with Isaac and Jacob, for He gave
them, too, the same promises, confirming the former by the second and the third.</p>
<p>Eran.—I remember them too.</p>
<p>Orth.—It is in relation to these covenants that the divine apostle writes in his Epistle to
the Galatians “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.” He saith not “seeds”
as of many, but as of one…which is Christ,990 very plainly showing that the manhood of
Christ sprang from the seed of Abraham, and fulfilled the promise made to Abraham.</p>
<p>Eran.—So the apostle says.</p>
<p>Orth.—Enough has been said to remove all the controversy raised on this point. But I
will nevertheless remind you of another prediction. The blessing given to the Patriarch
Jacob and to his father and his grandfather was given by him to his son Judah alone. He said
“A Prince shall not fail Judah, nor a leader from his loins, until he shall have come to whom
it is in store, and he is the expectation of the Gentiles.”991 Or do you not accept this prediction
as spoken of the Saviour Christ?</p>
<p>Eran.—Jews give erroneous interpretations of prophecies of this kind, but I am a
Christian; I trust in the Divine word; and I receive the prophecies without doubt.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since then you confess that you believe the prophecies and acknowledge the
predictions have been divinely uttered about our Saviour, consider what follows as to the
intention of the words of the apostle, for while pointing out that the promises made to the
patriarchs have reached their fulfilment, he uttered those remarkable words992 “He took
not on Him the nature of angels,” all but saying the promise is true; the Lord has fulfilled
His pledges; the fount of blessing is open to the gentiles; God had taken on Him the seed of
Abraham; through it He brings about the promised salvation; through it He confirms the
promise of the gentiles.</p>
<p>Eran.—The words of the Prophet fit in admirably with those of the apostle.</p>
<p>Orth.—So again the divine apostle, reminding us of the blessing of Judah, and pointing
out how it received its fulfilment exclaims993 “For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of
Judah.” So too the Prophet994 Micah and the evangelist995 Matthew. For the former spoke

his prediction, and the latter connects the prophecy with his narrative. What is extraordinary
is that he says that the open enemies of the truth plainly told Herod that the Christ is born
in Bethlehem, for it is written, he says, “And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not
the least among the Princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a Governor who shall rule
my people Israel.”996 Now let us subjoin what the Jews in their malignity omitted and so
made the witness imperfect. For the prophet, after saying “Out of thee shall he come forth
unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel” adds “Whose goings forth have been of old, from
everlasting.”997</p>
<p>Eran.—You have done well in adducing the whole evidence of the Prophet, for he points
out that He who was born in Bethlehem was God.</p>
<p>Orth.—Not God only but also Man; Man as sprung from Judah after the flesh and born
in Bethlehem; and God as existing before the ages. For the words “Out of thee shall he come
forth unto me that is to be Ruler,” shew his birth after the flesh which has taken place in the
last days; while the words “Whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting” plainly
proclaim His existence before the ages. In like manner also the divine apostle in his Epistle
to the Romans bewailing the change to the worse of the ancient felicity of the Jews, and
calling to mind their divine promises and legislation, goes on to say “Whose are the fathers,
and of whom concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God blessed for ever
Amen,”998 and in this same passage he exhibits Him both as Creator of all things and Lord
and Ruler as God and as sprung from the Jews as man.</p>
<p>Eran.—Well; you have explained these passages, what should you say to the prophecy
of Jeremiah? For this proclaims him to be God only.</p>
<p>Orth.—Of what prophecy do you speak?</p>
<p>Eran.—“This is our God and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison to
him—he hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant
and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth and conversed with
men.”999</p>
<p>In these words the Prophet speaks neither of the flesh, nor of manhood, nor of man,
but of God alone.</p>

<p>Orth.—What then is the good of reasoning? Do we say that the Divine nature is invisible?
or do we dissent from the Apostle when he says1000 “Immortal, invisible, the only God.”</p>
<p>Eran.—Indubitably the Divine nature is invisible.</p>
<p>Orth.—How then was it possible for the invisible nature to be seen without a body? Or
do you not remember those words of the apostle in which he distinctly teaches the invisibility
of the divine nature? He says “Whom no man hath seen nor can see.”1001 If therefore
the Divine Nature is invisible to men, and I will add too to Angels, tell me how he who
cannot be seen or beheld was seen upon earth?</p>
<p>Eran.—The Prophet says1002 he was seen on the earth.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the apostle says1003 “Immortal, invisible, the only God” and1004 “Whom
no man hath seen and can see.”</p>
<p>Eran.—What then? is the Prophet lying?</p>
<p>Orth.—God forbid. Both utterances are the words of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Eran.—Let us inquire then how the invisible was seen.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do not, I beg you, bring in human reason. I shall yield to scripture alone.</p>
<p>Eran.—You shall receive no argument unconfirmed by Holy Scripture, and if you bring
me any solution of the question deduced from Holy Scripture I will receive it, and will in
no wise gainsay it.</p>
<p>Orth.—You know how a moment ago we made the word of the evangelist clear by means
of the testimony of the apostle; and that the divine apostle showed us how the Word became
Flesh, saying plainly “for verily He took not on Him the nature of angels but He took on
Him the seed of Abraham.”1005 The same teacher will teach us how the divine Word was
seen upon the earth and dwelt among men.</p>
<p>Eran.—I submit to the words both of apostles and of prophets. Shew me then in accordance
with your promise the interpretation of the prophecy.</p>

the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.”1006</p>

<p>It is therefore plain that the divine nature is invisible, but the flesh visible, and that
through the visible the invisible was seen, by its means working wonders and unveiling its
own power, for with the hand He fashioned the sense of seeing and healed him that was
blind from birth. Again He gave the power of hearing to the deaf, and loosed the fettered
tongue, using his fingers for a tool and applying his spittle like some healing medicine. So
again when He walked upon the sea He displayed the almighty power of the Godhead. Fitly,
therefore, did the apostle say “God was manifest in the flesh.” For through it appeared the
invisible nature beheld by its means by the angel hosts, for “He was seen,” he says, “of angels.”</p>
<p>The nature then of bodiless beings has shared with us the enjoyment of this boon.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then did not the angels see God before the manifestation of the Saviour?</p>
<p>Orth.—The apostle says that He “was made manifest in the flesh and seen of angels.”</p>
<p>Eran.—But the Lord said, “Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I
say unto you that their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.”1007</p>
<p>Orth.—But the Lord said again, “Not that any man hath seen the Father save he which
is of God, he hath seen the Father.”1008 Wherefore the evangelist plainly exclaims, “No man
hath seen God at any time,”1009 and confirms the word of the Lord, for he says, “The only
begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father He hath declared Him,” and the great
Moses, when he desired to see the invisible nature, heard the Lord God saying, “There shall
no man see me and live.”1010</p>
<p>Eran.—How then are we to understand the words, “Their angels do always behold the
face of my Father which is in heaven”?</p>
<p>Orth.—Just as we commonly understand what is said about men who have been supposed
to see God.</p>
<p>Eran.—Pray make this plainer, for I do not understand. Can God be seen of men also?
Orth.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yet we hear the divine scripture saying God appeared unto Abraham at the oak
of Mamre;1011 and Isaiah says “I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up,”1012
and the same thing is said by Micah, by Daniel and Ezekiel. And of the lawgiver Moses it is

related that “The Lord spake to Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend,”1013
and the God of the universe Himself said, “With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even
apparently and not in dark speeches.”1014 What then shall we say; did they behold the divine
nature?</p>
<p>Orth.—By no means, for God Himself said, “There shall no man see me and live.”</p>
<p>Eran.—Then they who say that they have seen God are liars?</p>
<p>Orth.—God forbid—they saw what it was possible for them to see.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then the loving Lord accommodates his revelation to the capacity of them that
see Him?</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; and this He has shewn through the Prophet, “for I,” He says, “have multiplied
visions and by the hands of the Prophets was made like.”1015</p>
<p>He does not say “was seen” but “was made like.” And making like does not shew the
very nature of the thing seen. For even the image of the emperor does not exhibit the emperor’s
nature, though it distinctly preserves his features.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is obscure and not sufficiently plain. Was not then the substance of God
seen by them who beheld those revelations?</p>
<p>Orth.—No; for who is mad enough to dare to say so?</p>
<p>Eran.—But yet it is said that they saw.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; it is said; but we both in the exercise of reverent reason, and in reliance on
the Divine utterances, which exclaim distinctly, “No man hath seen God at any time,” affirm
that they did not see the Divine Nature, but certain visions adapted to their capacity.</p>
<p>Eran.—So we say.</p>
<p>Orth.—So also then let us understand of the angels when we hear that they daily see the
face of your Father.1016 For what they see is not the divine substance which cannot be circumscribed,
comprehended, or apprehended, which embraces the universe, but some glory
made commensurate with their nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is acknowledged.</p>
<p>Orth.—After the incarnation, however, He was seen also of angels, as the divine apostle
says, not however by similitude of glory, but using the true and living covering of the flesh
as a kind of screen. “God,” he says, “was made manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit,
seen of angels.”1017</p>

<p>Orth.—What novelties of phrase have we introduced?</p>
<p>Eran.—That of the “screen.” What Scripture calls the flesh of the Lord a screen?</p>
<p>Orth.—You do not seem to be a very diligent reader of your Bible; if you had been you
would not have found fault with what we have said as in a figure. For first of all the fact that
the divine apostle says that the invisible nature was made manifest through the flesh allows
us to understand the flesh as a screen of the Godhead. Secondly, the divine apostle in his
Epistle to the Hebrews, distinctly uses the phrase, for he says, “Having therefore, brethren,
boldness to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way, which he
hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say his flesh; and having an High Priest
over the House of God. Coming with truth drawing near with a true heart in fulness of
faith.”1018</p>
<p>Eran.—Your demonstration is unanswerable, for it is based on apostolic authority.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do not then charge us with innovation. We will adduce for you yet another
prophetic authority, distinctly calling the Lord’s flesh a robe and mantle.</p>
<p>Eran.—Should it not appear obscure and ambiguous we will say nothing against it, and
be thankful for it.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will make you yourself testify to the truth of the promise. You know how the
Patriarch Jacob, when he was addressing Judah, limited the sovereignty of Judah by the birth
of the Lord.1019 “A prince shall not fail Judah, nor a leader from his loins until he shall have
come to whom it is in store and he is the expectation of the Gentiles.” You have already
confessed that this prophecy was uttered about the saviour.</p>
<p>Eran.—I have.</p>
<p>Orth.—Remember then what follows; for he says “And unto him shall the gathering of
the people be<gap reason="omitted"/>he shall wash his robe in wine and his mantle in the blood of the grape.”1020</p>
<p>Eran.—The Patriarch spoke of garments, not of a body.</p>
<p>Orth.—Tell me, then, when or where he washed his cloak in the blood of the grape?</p>
<p>Eran.—Nay; tell me you when he reddened his body in it?</p>
<p>Orth.—Answer I beseech you more reverently.1021 Perhaps some of the uninitiated are
within hearing.</p>
<p>Eran.—I will both hear and answer in mystic language.</p>

<p>Orth.—Now what is the fruit of a vine called after it is pressed?</p>

<p>Orth.—When the soldiers wounded the Saviour’s side with the spear, what did the
evangelist say was poured out from it?</p>
<p>Eran.—Blood and water.1023</p>
<p>Orth.—Well, then; he called the Saviour’s blood blood of the grape, for if the Lord is
called a vine, and the fruit of the vine wine, and from the Lord’s side streams of blood and
water flowed downwards over the rest of his body, fitly and appropriately the Patriarch
foretells “He shall wash his robe in wine and his mantle in blood of the grape.” For as we
after the consecration call the mystic fruit of the vine the Lord’s blood, so he called the blood
of the true vine blood of the grape.</p>
<p>Eran.—The point before us has been set forth in language at once mystical and clear.</p>
<p>Orth.—Although what has been said is enough for your faith, I will, for confirmation
of the faith, give you yet another proof.</p>
<p>Eran.—I shall be grateful to you for so doing, for you will increase the favour done me.</p>
<p>Orth.—You know how God called His own body bread?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And how in another place he called His flesh corn?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, I know. For I have heard Him saying “The hour is come that the Son of
man should be glorified,”1024 and “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abideth alone; but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.”1025</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; and in the giving of the mysteries He called the bread, body, and what had
been mixed, blood.</p>
<p>Eran.—He so did.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet naturally the body would properly be called body, and the blood, blood.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—But our Saviour changed the names, and to His body gave the name of the
symbol and to the symbol that of his body. So, after calling himself a vine, he spoke of the
symbol as blood.</p>
<p>Eran.—True. But I am desirous of knowing the reason of the change of names.</p>
<p>Orth.—To them that are initiated in divine things the intention is plain. For he wished
the partakers in the divine mysteries not to give heed to the nature of the visible objects,
but, by means of the variation of the names, to believe the change wrought of grace. For He,
we know, who spoke of his natural body as corn and bread, and, again, called Himself a

<pb n="387"/>
vine, dignified the visible symbols by the appellation of the body and blood, not because He
had changed their nature, but because to their nature He had added grace.1026</p>
<p>Eran.—The mysteries are spoken of in mystic language, and there is a clear declaration
of that which is not known to all.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since then it is agreed that the body of the Lord is called by the patriarch “robe”
and “mantle”1027 and we have reached the discussion of the divine mysteries, tell me truly,
of what do you understand the Holy Food to be a symbol and type? Of the godhead of the
Lord Christ, or of His body and His blood?</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly of those things of which they received the names.</p>
<p>Orth.—You mean of the body and of the blood?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have spoken as a lover of truth should speak, for when the Lord had taken
the symbol, He did not say “this is my godhead,” but “this is my body;” and again “this is
my blood”1028 and in another place “the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give
for the life of the world.”1029</p>
<p>Eran.—These words are true, for they are the divine oracles.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then they are true, I suppose the Lord had a body.</p>
<p>Eran.—No; for I maintain him to be bodiless.</p>
<p>Orth.—But you confess that He had a body?</p>
<p>Eran.—I say that the Word was made flesh, for so I have been taught.</p>
<p>Orth.—It seems, as the proverb has it, as if we are drawing water in a pail with a hole
in it.1030 For after all our demonstrations and solutions of difficulties, you are bringing the
same arguments round again.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am not giving you my arguments, but those of the gospels.</p>

those of prophets and apostles?</p>

<p>Orth.—And yet we shewed how, being invisible, He was made manifest through flesh,
and the relationship of this very flesh we have been taught by the sacred writers—“He took
on Him the seed of Abraham.”1031 And the Lord God said to the patriarch, “in thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,”1032 and the apostle, “It is evident our Lord
sprang out of Judah.”1033 We adduced further several similar testimonies; but, since you
are desirous of hearing yet others, listen to the apostle when he says, “For every high priest
taken from among men is ordained that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it
is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.”1034</p>
<p>Eran.—Point out, then, how He offered after taking a body.</p>
<p>Orth.—The divine apostle himself clearly teaches in the very passage, for after a few
words he says: “Wherefore, when He cometh into the world, He saith, sacrifice and offering
thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me.”1035 He does not say “into a body hast
thou changed,” but “a body hast thou prepared,” and he shows plainly that the formation
of the body was wrought by the Spirit in accordance with the utterance of the gospel, “Fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is generated in her is of the Holy
Ghost.”1036</p>
<p>Eran.—The virgin then gave birth only to a body?</p>
<p>Orth.—It appears that you do not even understand the composition of words, much
less their meaning, for he is teaching Joseph the manner, not of the generation, but of the
conception. For he does not say that which is generated of her, i.e. made, or formed, is of
the Holy Ghost. Joseph, ignorant of the mystery, was suspicions of adultery; he was therefore
plainly taught the formation by the Spirit. It is this which He signified through the prophet
when He said “A body hast thou prepared me”1037 for the divine Apostle being full of the
Spirit interpreted the prediction. If then the offering of gifts is the special function of priests

and Christ in His humanity was called priest and offered no other sacrifice save1038 His
own body, then the Lord Christ had a body.</p>
<p>Eran.—This even I have repeatedly affirmed, and I do not say that the divine Word
appeared without a body. What I maintain is not that He took a body but that He was made
flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—So far as I see our contest lies with the supporters of Valentinus, of Marcion,
and of Manes; but even they never had the hardihood to say that the immutable nature underwent
mutation into flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—Reviling is unchristian.</p>
<p>Orth.—We do not revile, but we are fighting for truth, and we are vexed at your arguing
about the indisputable as though it could be disputed. However, I will endeavour to put an
end to your ungracious contention. Answer now; do you remember the promises which
God made to David?</p>
<p>Eran.—Which?</p>
<p>Orth.—Those which the prophet inserted in the 88th Psalm.</p>
<p>Eran.—I know that many promises were made to David. Which are you enquiring about
now?</p>
<p>Orth.—Those which refer to the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>Eran.—Recall the utterances yourself, for you promised to adduce your proofs.</p>
<p>Orth.—Listen now how the prophet praises God at the very beginning of the Psalm. He
saw with his prophetic eyes the future iniquity of his people, and the captivity that was in
consequence foredoomed; yet he praised his own Lord for unfailing promises. “I will sing,”
he says, “of the mercies of the Lord forever, with my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness
to all generations, for thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever, Thy faithfulness
shalt Thou establish in the very heavens.”1039</p>
<p>Through all this the prophet teaches that the promise was made by God on account of
lovingkindness, and that the promise is faithful. Then he goes on to say what He promised,
and to whom, introducing God Himself as the speaker. (“I have made a covenant with my

and Mark x. 40. is confused in A.V., and an Arian sense given to our Lord’s declaration, “To sit on my right
hand and my left is not mine to give save to them for whom it is prepared.” i.e. It is His to give, but not to give
arbitrarily or of caprice. Liddell and Scott, Ed. 1883, recognise and illustrate this use of ἀλλὰ (Vide s.v. I. 3.)

chosen.”1040) It is the Patriarchs that He called chosen; then He goes on “I have sworn unto
David my servant,”1041 and He states concerning what He swore, “Thy seed will I establish
for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.”1042</p>
<p>Now whom do you suppose to be called the seed of David?</p>
<p>Eran.—The promise was made about Solomon.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then he made his covenant with the Patriarchs about Solomon, for before what
was said about David he mentioned the promises made to the Patriarchs “I have made a
covenant with my chosen,” and He promised the Patriarchs that in their seed He would
bless all nations. Kindly point out how the nations were blessed through Solomon.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then God fulfilled this promise, not by means of Solomon, but of our Saviour.</p>
<p>Orth.—So then our Lord Christ gave the fulfilment to the promises made to David.
Eran.—I hold that these promises were made by God, either about Solomon, or about
Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>Orth.—Just now you used the arguments of Marcion and Valentinus and of Manes.</p>
<p>Now you have gone over to the directly opposite faction, and are advocating the impudence
of the Jews. This is just like all those who turn out of a straight road; they err and stray first
one way and then another, wandering in a wilderness.</p>
<p>Eran.—Revilers are excluded by the Apostle from the kingdom.1043</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes, if their revilings are vain. Sometimes the divine Apostle himself opportunely
uses this mode of speech. He calls the Galatians “foolish,”1044 and of others he says “men
of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith,”1045 and again of another set, “Whose
God is their belly, whose glory is in their shame,”1046 and so forth.</p>
<p>Eran.—What occasion did I give you for reviling?</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you really not think that the willing advocacy of the declared enemies of the
truth furnishes the pious with very reasonable ground of indignation?</p>
<p>Eran.—And what enemies of the truth have I patronized?</p>
<p>Orth.—Now, Jews.</p>
<p>Eran.—How so?</p>
<p>Orth.—Jews connect prophecies of this kind with Solomon and Zerubbabel, in order
to exhibit the groundlessness of the Christian position; but the mere words are quite enough

to convict them of their iniquity, for it is written “I will establish my throne for ever.”1047
Now not only Solomon and Zerubbabel, to whom such prophecies are applied by the Jews,
have lived out their appointed time, and reached the end of life, but the whole race of David
has become extinct; for who ever heard of any one at the present day descended from the
root of David?</p>
<p>Eran.—But are not, then, those who are called Patriarchs of the Jews of the family of
David?</p>
<p>Orth.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Eran.—Whence, then, are they sprung?</p>
<p>Orth.—From the foreigner Herod, who, on his father’s side, was an Ascalonite, and on
his mother’s an Idumæan;1048 but they, too, have all disappeared, and many years have gone
by since their sovereignty came to an end. But our Lord God promised not only to maintain
the seed of David for ever, but to establish his kingdom undestroyed; for He said, “I will
build up my throne to all generations.”</p>
<p>But we see that his race is gone, and his kingdom come to an end. Yet though we see
this, we know that the God of the Universe is true.</p>
<p>Eran.—That God is true is plain.</p>
<p>Orth.—If, then, God is true, as in truth He is, and promised David that He would establish
His race for ever, and keep his kingdom through all time, and if neither race nor kingdom
are to be seen, for both have come to an end, how can we convince our opponents that God
is true?</p>
<p>Eran.—I suppose, then, the prophecy really points to the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>Orth.—If, then, you confess this, let us investigate together a passage in the middle of
the Psalm; we shall then more clearly see what the prophecy means.</p>
<p>Eran.—Lead on; I will religiously follow in your footsteps.</p>
<p>Orth.—After making many promises about this seed that it should be Lord both by sea
and land1049 and higher than the kings of the earth and be called the first begotten of God,1050
and should boldly call God, Father1051 God also added this, “My mercy will I keep for him

for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure
for ever and his throne as the days of heaven.”1052</p>
<p>Eran.—The promise goes beyond the bounds of human nature, for both the life and the
honour are indestructible and eternal. But men endure but for a season; their nature is short
lived and their kingdom even during its lifetime undergoes many and various vicissitudes,
so that truly the greatness of the prophecy befits none but the Saviour Christ.</p>
<p>Orth.—Go on then to what follows and your opinion upon this point will be in every
way confirmed, for again saith the God of the universe, “Once have I sworn by my holiness,
if I lie unto David, his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me. It shall
be established for ever as the moon.”1053</p>
<p>Then, pointing out the truth of the promise He adds, “And the witness is faithful in
heaven.”</p>
<p>Eran.—We must believe without doubt in the promises given by the faithful witness,
for, if we are wont to believe men who have promised to speak the truth even if they do not
confirm their words with an oath, who can be so mad as to disbelieve the Creator of the
Universe, when He adds an oath to his words? For He who forbids others to swear confirmed
the immutability of his counsel by an oath,1054 “that by two immutable things in which it
was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge
to lay hold upon the hope set before us.”1055</p>
<p>Orth.—If then the promise is irrefragable, and among the Jews there is now neither
family nor kingdom of the prophet David to be seen, let us believe that our Lord Jesus Christ
is plainly called seed of David in His humanity, for of Him the life and the kingdom are
both alike eternal.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have no doubt; and this I own to be the truth.</p>
<p>Orth.—These proofs then are sufficient to show clearly the manhood which our Lord
and Saviour took of David’s seed. But to remove all possibility of doubt by the witness of
the majority, let us hear how God makes mention of the promises given to David through
the voice of the prophet Isaiah. “I will make,” he says, “an everlasting covenant with you,”
and, signifying the law-giver, he adds, “even the sure mercies of David.”1056</p>
<p>Since He made this promise to David, and spoke through Esaias, He will assuredly bring
the promise to pass. And what follows after the prophecy is in harmony with what I say, for
he saith “Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to

the people. Behold nations that know thee not shall call upon thee, and peoples that understand
thee not shall run unto thee.”1057 Now this fits in with none that are sprung from
David, for who of David’s descendants, as Esaias says, was made a ruler of nations? And
what nations in their prayers ever called on David’s descendants as God?</p>
<p>Eran.—About what is perfectly clear it is unbecoming to dispute, and this plainly refers
to the Lord Christ.
Orth.—Then let us pass on to another prophetic testimony and let us hear the same
prophet saying “There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall
grow out of his roots.”1058</p>
<p>Eran.—I think this prophecy was delivered about Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>Orth.—If you hear what follows, you will not remain in your opinion. The Jews have
never so understood this prediction, for the prophet goes on, “and the Spirit of the Lord
shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.”1059 This would never be attributed by any
one to a mere man, for even to the very holy the gifts of the Spirit are given by division, as
the divine apostle witnesses when he says, “To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom,
to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit,”1060 and so on. The prophet describes
Him who sprang from the root of Jesse as possessing all the powers of the spirit.</p>
<p>Eran.—To gainsay this were sheer folly.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now hear what follows. You will see some things that transcend human nature,
he goes on. “He shall not judge after the sight of His eyes, neither reprove after the hearing
of His ears, but with righteousness shall He judge the poor, and reprove with equity the
mighty1061 of the earth, and He shall smite the earth with the word of His mouth, and with
the breath of His lips shall he slay the wicked.”1062 Now of these predictions some are human
and some divine. Justice, truth, equity, and rectitude in giving judgment exhibit virtue in
human nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have so far clearly learned that the prophet predicts the coming of our Saviour
Christ.</p>
<p>Orth.—The sequel will shew you yet more plainly the truth of the interpretation. For
he goes on, “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,”1063 and so on, whereby he teaches at once

the distinction of modes of life and the harmony of faith; and experience furnishes a proof
of the prediction, for they that abound in wealth, they that live in poverty, servants and
masters, rulers and ruled, soldiers and citizens and they that wield the sceptre of the world
are received in one font, are all taught one doctrine, are all admitted to one mystic table,
and each of the believers enjoys an equal share.</p>
<p>Eran.—It is thus shewn that God is spoken of.</p>
<p>Orth.—Not only God but man. So at the very beginning of this prediction he says that
a rod shall grow out of the root of Jesse. Then at the conclusion of the prediction he takes
up once more the strain with which he began, for he says “There shall be a root of Jesse
which shall stand for an ensign of the people, to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall
be glorious.”1064 Now Jesse was the father of David, and the promise with an oath was made
to David. The prophet would not have spoken of the Lord Christ as a rod growing out of
Jesse if he had only known Him as God. The prediction also foretold the change of the world,
for “the earth” he says “shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the
sea.”1065</p>
<p>Eran.—I have heard the prophetic utterances. But I was anxious to know clearly if the
divine company of the apostles also says that the Lord Christ sprang from the seed of David
according to the flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have asked for information which so far from being hard is exceedingly
easy to give you. Only listen to the first of the apostles exclaiming “David being a prophet
and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to
the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit upon His throne; he seeing this before spake of the
resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in hell neither His flesh did see corruption.”
1066</p>
<p>Hence you may perceive that of the seed of David according to the flesh sprang the Lord
Christ, and had not flesh only but also a soul.</p>
<p>Eran.—What other apostle preached this?</p>
<p>Orth.—The great Peter alone was sufficient to testify to the truth, for the Lord after receiving
the confession of the truth given by Peter alone confirmed it by a memorable approval.
But since you are anxious to hear others proclaiming this same thing, hear Paul and Barnabas
preaching in Antioch in Pisidia; for they, when they had made mention of David, continued
“Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus,”1067
and so on. And in a letter to Timothy the divine Paul says “Remember that Jesus Christ of

<pb n="395"/>
the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.”1068 And, when writing
to the Romans, at the very outset he calls attention to the Davidic kin, for he says “Paul a
servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God which He
had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning His Son which was
made of the seed of David according to the flesh,”1069 and so on.</p>
<p>Eran.—Your proofs are numerous and convincing; but tell me why you have omitted
what follows?</p>
<p>Orth.—Because it is not about the Godhead, but about the manhood, that you are in
difficulties. Had you been in doubt about the Godhead, I would have given you proof of it.
It is enough to say “according to the Flesh” to declare the Godhead which is not expressed
in terms. When speaking of a relationship of man in general I do not say the son of such an
one “according to the flesh,” but simply “son,” so the divine Evangelist writing his genealogy
says “Abraham begat Isaac”1070 and does not add according to the flesh, for Isaac was merely
man, and he mentions the rest in like manner, for they were men and had no qualities
transcending their nature. But when the heralds of the truth are discoursing of our Lord
Christ, and are pointing out to the ignorant His lower relation, they add the words “according
to the flesh,” thus indicating His Godhead and teaching that the Lord Christ was not only
man but also Eternal God.</p>
<p>Eran.—You have adduced many proofs from the apostles and prophets, but I follow
the words of the Evangelist “The Word was made Flesh.”1071</p>
<p>Orth.—I also follow this divine teaching, but I understand it in a pious sense, as meaning
that He was made Flesh by taking flesh and a reasonable soul. But if the divine Word took
nothing of our nature, then the covenants made with the patriarchs by the God of all with
oaths were not true, and the blessing of Judah was vain, and the promise to David was false,
and the Virgin was superfluous, because she did not contribute anything of our nature to
the Incarnate God. Then the predictions of the prophets have no fulfilment. Then vain is
our preaching, vain our faith and vain the hope of the resurrection1072 for the Apostle, it
appears, lies when he says “and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in

heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”1073 For if the Lord Christ had nothing of our nature then
He is falsely described as our first fruits, and His bodily nature has not risen from the dead
and has not taken the seat in Heaven on the right hand; and if He has obtained none of these
things, how hath God raised us up together and made us sit together with Christ, when we
in no wise belong to Him in Nature? But it is impious to say this, for the divine apostle,
though the general resurrection has not yet taken place, though the kingdom of heaven has
not yet been bestowed upon the faithful, exclaims, “He hath raised us up together and made
us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” in order to teach that since the resurrection
of our first fruits, and His sitting on the right hand has come to pass, we too in general shall
attain the resurrection, and that all they who share in His nature and have adopted His faith,
share too in the first fruits of His glory.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have gone through many and sound arguments, but I was anxious to know
the force of the Gospel saying.</p>
<p>Orth.—You stand in need of no interpretation from without. The evangelist himself
interprets himself. For after saying “the Word was made flesh,” he goes on “and dwelt among
us.”1074 That is to say by dwelling in us, and using the flesh taken from us as a kind of temple,
He is said to have been made flesh, and, teaching that He remained unchanged, the evangelist
adds “and we beheld His glory—the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace
and truth.”1075 For though clad with flesh He exhibited His Father’s nobility, shot forth the
beams of the Godhead, and emitted the radiance of the power of the Lord, revealing by His
works of wonder His hidden nature. A similar illustration is afforded by the words of the
divine apostle to the Philippians: “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made
Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant and was made in the
likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled Himself and became
obedient unto death even the death of the cross.”1076</p>
<p>Look at the relation of the utterances. The evangelist says “the Word was made flesh
and dwelt among us,” the apostle, “took upon him the form of a servant;” the evangelist
“We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father”—the apostle, “who
being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God.” To put the matter
briefly, both teach that being God and son of God, and clad with His Father’s glory, and
having the same nature and power with Him that begat Him, He that was in the beginning
and was with God, and was God, and was Creator of the world, took upon Him the form

of a servant, and it seemed that this was all which was seen; but it was God clad in human
nature, and working out the salvation of men. This is what was meant by “The word was
made flesh” and “was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man.”
This is all that was looked at by the Jews, and therefore they said to him “For a good work
we stone Thee not but for blasphemy and because that Thou being a man makest Thyself
God,”1077 and again “This man is not of God because He keepeth not the Sabbath Day.”1078</p>
<p>Eran.—The Jews were blind on account of their unbelief, and therefore used these words.</p>
<p>Orth.—If you find even the apostles before the resurrection thus saying, will you receive
the interpretation? I hear them in the boat, after the mighty miracle of the calm, saying
“what manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”1079</p>
<p>Eran.—This is made plain. But now tell me this;—the divine apostle says that He “was
made in the likeness of man.”</p>
<p>Orth.—What was taken of him was not man’s likeness, but man’s nature. For “form of
a servant” is understood just as “the form of God” is understood to mean God’s nature. He
took this, and so was made in the likeness of man, and was found in fashion as a man. For,
being God, He seemed to be man, on account of the nature which He took. The evangelist,
however, speaks of His being made in the likeness of man as His being made flesh. But that
you may know that they who deny the flesh of the Saviour are of the opposite spirit, hear
the great John in his Catholic Epistle saying “Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh is not of God, and this is that spirit of Anti-Christ.”1080</p>
<p>Eran.—You have given a plausible interpretation, but I was anxious to know how the
old teachers of the Church have understood the passage “the word was made flesh.”</p>
<p>Orth.—You ought to have been persuaded by the apostolic and prophetic proofs; but
since you require further the interpretations of the holy Fathers I will also furnish you, God
helping me, this medicine.</p>
<p>Eran.—Do not bring me men of obscure position or doubtful doctrine. I shall not receive
the interpretation of such as these.</p>
<p>Orth.—Does the far famed Athanasius, brightest light of the church of Alexandria, seem
to you to be worthy of credit?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly, for he ratified his teaching by the suffering he underwent for the
Truth’s sake.</p>

<p>Orth.—Hear then how he wrote to Epictetus.1081 “The expression of John ‘the Word
was made flesh’ has this interpretation, so far as can be discovered from the similar passage
which we find in St. Paul ‘Christ was made a curse for us.’1082 It is not because He was made
a curse but because He received the curse on our behalf that He is said to have been made
a curse, and so it is not because He was turned into flesh, but because He took flesh on our
behalf, that He is said to have been made flesh.” So far the divine Athanasius. Gregory, too,
whose glory among all men is great, who formerly ruled the Imperial city at the mouth of
the Bosphorus and afterwards dwelt at Nazianzus, thus wrote to Cledonius against the specious
fallacies of Apollinarius.</p>
<p>Eran.—He was an illustrious man and a foremost fighter in the cause of piety.
Orth.—Hear him then. He says1083 “the expression ‘He was made Flesh’ seems to be
parallel to His being said to have been made sin and a curse,1084 not because the Lord was
transmuted into these,—for how could He?—but because He accepted these when He took
on Him our iniquities and bore our infirmities.”1085</p>
<p>Eran.—The two interpretations agree.</p>
<p>Orth.—We have shown you the pastors of the south and north in harmony; now then
let us introduce too the illustrious teachers of the west, who have written their interpretation,
if with another tongue, yet with one and the same mind.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am told that Ambrosius, who adorned the episcopal throne at Milan, fought
in the first ranks against all heresy, and wrote works of great beauty and in agreement with
the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will give you his interpretation. Ambrosius says in his work concerning the
faith “It is written that the Word was made flesh. I do not deny that it is written, but look
at the terms used; for there follows ‘and dwelt among us,’ that is to say dwelt in human flesh.
You are therefore astonished at the terms in which it is written that the Word was made
flesh, on the assumption of flesh, by the divine Word, when also concerning sin which He
had not, it is said that He was made sin, that is to say not that He was made the nature and
operation of sin, but that he might crucify our sin in the flesh; let them then give over asserting
that the nature of the Word has undergone change and alteration, for He who took is
one and that which was taken other.”1086</p>

<p>It is now fitting that you should hear the teachers of the east, this being the only quarter
of the east, this being the only quarter of the world which we have hitherto left unnoticed,
though they indeed might well have first witnessed to the truth, for to them was first imparted
the teaching of the apostles. But since you have sharpened your tongues against the firstborn
sons of piety by whetting them on the hone of falsehood, we have reserved for them
the last place, that after first hearing the rest, you might lay witness by the side of witness,
and so at once admire their harmony, and cease from your own interminable talk. Listen
then to Flavianus who for a long time right wisely moved the tiller of the church of Antioch,
and made the churches which he guided ride safe over the Arian storm, by expounding to
them the word of the gospel. “The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us; He is not
turned into flesh, nor yet did he cease from being God, for this he was from all eternity and
became flesh in the dispensation of the incarnation1087 after himself building his own temple,
and taking up his abode in the passible creature.” And if you desire to hear the ancients of
Palestine, lend your ears to the admirable Gelasius, who did diligent husbandry in the church
of Cæsarea. Now these are his words in his homily on the festival of the Lord’s epiphany.1088
“Learn the truth from the words of John the Fisherman, ‘And the word was made flesh,’ not
having himself undergone change, but having taken up his abode with us. The dwelling is
one thing; the Word is another; the temple is one thing, and God who dwells in it, another.”</p>
<p>Eran.—I am much struck by the agreement.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now do you not suppose that the rule of the apostolic faith was kept by John,
who first nobly watered the field of the church of the Antiochenes, and then was a wise
husbandman of that of the imperial city?</p>

of Christ’s nativity and baptism on January 6th. The date of the severance of the two can be approximately
fixed, for Chrysostom refers to it as a matter of merely a few years’ standing, in a sermon probably delivered on
the Christmas day of 386 a.d. How far back we are to refer the origin of this two-fold festival it is not easy to
determine, the earliest mention of any kind being the allusion by Clement of Alexandria to the annual commemoration
of Christ’s baptism by the Basilidians (Stromata, lib. i. c. 21). At any rate by the latter part of the fourth
century the Epiphany had become one of the most important and venerable festivals in the Eastern church.”

<p>Eran.—I hold this teacher to be in all respects an admirable one.
Orth.—Well, this most excellent man has interpreted this passage of the Gospel. He
writes,1089 “When you hear that the Word was made flesh, be not startled or cast down, for
the substance did not deteriorate into flesh—an idea of the uttermost impiety—but continuing
to be just what it is, so took the form of a servant. For just as when the apostle says ‘Christ
hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,’1090 he does not say
that the substance of Christ departed from His own glory, and took the substance of a curse,
a position which not even devils would imagine, nor the utterly senseless, and the naturally
idiotic—so remarkable being the connection between impiety and insanity. But what he
does assert is that after receiving the curse due to us, He does not suffer us to be cursed for
the future. It is in this sense that He is stated to have been made flesh, not because he had
changed the substance into flesh, but because he had assumed the flesh, the substance remaining
all the while unimpaired.”1091</p>
<p>You may like to hear also Severianus, Bishop of Gabala.1092 If so, I will adduce his
testimony and do you lend your ears.</p>
<p>“The text ‘the Word was made flesh’ does not indicate a deterioration of nature but the
assumption of our nature. Suppose you take the word ‘was made’ to indicate a change; then
when you hear Paul saying ‘Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
a curse for us,’ do you understand him to mean a change into the nature of a curse? Just as
being made a curse had no other meaning than that He took our curse upon Himself, so
the words was made flesh and dwelt among us mean nothing other than the assumption of
flesh.”</p>
<p>Eran.—I admire the exact agreement1093 of these men. For they are as unanimous in
giving the same interpretations of evangelical writings as if they had met in the same place
and written down their opinion together.</p>
<p>Orth.—Mountains and seas separate them very far from one another, yet distance does
not damage their harmony, for they were all inspired by the same gift of the spirit. I would
also have offered you the interpretations of the victorious champions of piety Diodorus and

<p>“If then the first Adam had had a human father and had been begotten of seed, it would
have been reasonable to say that the second Adam had been begotten of Joseph. But if the
former was taken from earth, and his creator was God, it was necessary also that He who
renews in himself the man created by God should have the same likeness of generation with
that former. Why then did not God again take dust? Why did he on the other hand ordain
that the formation should be made of Mary? That there might be no other creation; that
that which was being saved might be no other thing; but that the former might himself be
renewed without loss of the likeness. For then do they too fall away who allege that He took
nothing from the Virgin, that they may repudiate the inheritance of the flesh and cast off
the likeness.”1109</p>
<p>Of the same from the same book:—</p>
<p>“Since his going down into Mary is useless; for why went He down into her if He was
designed to take nothing from her? And further, if He had taken nothing from Mary He
would not have accepted the food taken from earth whereby is nourished the body taken
from earth, nor would He like Moses and Elias, after fasting forty days, have hungered, on
account of His body demanding its own food, nor yet would John his disciple when writing

was made by Him, then He who is and is the cause of all created things was not made of a

husbandman, for He Himself through the Word tilled the vine which is the Lord’s body.”</p>

<p>“The Lord was called a vine on account of His bodily relationship to the branches which
are ourselves.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his greater oration concerning the faith:—</p>
<p>“The scripture ‘in the beginning was the Word’1132 clearly indicates the Godhead. The
passage ‘the Word was made flesh’1133 shews the human nature of the Lord.”</p>
<p>From the same discourse:—</p>
<p>“‘He shall wash His garments in wine’1134 that is His body, which is the vestment of the
Godhead in His own blood.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same discourse:—</p>
<p>“The Word ‘was’1135 is referred to His divinity, the words ‘was made flesh’1136 to His
body, the Word was made flesh not by being reduced to flesh, but by bearing flesh, just as
any one might say such an one became or was made an old man, though not so born from
the beginning, or the soldier became a veteran, not being previously such as he became.
John says, ‘I became,’ or ‘was in the island of Patmos on the Lord’s day.’1137 Not that he was
made or born there, but he says ‘I became or was in Patmos’ instead of saying ‘I arrived;’ so
the Word ‘arrived’ at flesh, as it is said ‘the Word was made flesh.’ Hear the words ‘I became
like a broken vessel,’1138 and ‘I became like a man that hath no strength, free among the
dead.’”1139</p>

<p>“Whoever heard such things? Who taught them? Who learnt them? ‘Out of Zion shall
go forth the law and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.’1140 But whence did these things
come forth? What hell vomited them out? To say that the body taken of Mary was of the
same substance as the Godhead of the Word, or that the Word was changed into flesh and
bones and hairs and a whole body; whoever heard in a church or at all among Christians
that God bore a body by adoption and not by birth?”1141</p>
<p>Of the same from the same Epistle:—</p>
<p>“But who, hearing that the Word made for Himself a passible body, not of Mary, but
of His own substance, would call the sayer of these things a Christian? Who has invented
so unfounded an impiety, as even to think and to say that they who affirm the Lord’s body
to be of Mary, conceive no longer of a Trinity, but of a quaternity in the godhead? As though
they that are of this opinion described the flesh which the Saviour clothed himself with of
Mary as of the substance of the Trinity.</p>
<p>“Whence further have some men vomited forth an impiety as bad as the foregoing, and
alleged that the body is not of later time than the godhead of the Word, but has always been
co-eternal with it, since it is formed of the substance of wisdom.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same letter:—</p>
<p>“So the body taken of Mary was human according to the scriptures, and real in that it
was the same as our own. For Mary was our sister, since we are all of Adam, a fact which
no one could doubt who remembers the words of Luke.”1142</p>

God whereby he came among men.”
Of the same from his writings about the Holy Ghost to Amphilochius:—</p>

<p>Testimony of the holy Gregory bishop of Nazianus. From the former exposition to
Cledonius:—</p>
<p>“If any one says that the flesh came down from heaven, and not from this earth, and
from us, let him be Anathema. For the words ‘The second man is from heaven,’1146 and ‘as
is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly’1147 and ‘no man hath ascended up to
heaven but the son of man that came down from heaven,’1148 and any other similar passage,
must be understood to be spoken on account of the union with man, as also the statement
that ‘all things were made by Christ,’1149 and that ‘Christ dwells in our hearts,’1150 must be
understood not according to the sensible, but according to the intellectual conception of
the Godhead, the terms being commingled together just as are the natures.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Let us see from their own words what reason they give for the being made man, that
is for the incarnation. If indeed it was that God otherwise not contained in space, might be
contained in space and, as it were under a veil, might converse with men in the flesh, then
their mask and their stage play are exquisite: not to say that it was possible for Him otherwise
to converse with us, as of yore, in a burning bush and in human form, but if that He might
undo the damnation of sin by taking like to like1151 then just as He required flesh on account
of the condemned flesh, and a soul on account of the soul, so too he required a mind on
account of the mind, which in Adam not only fell but,—to employ a term which physicians
are accustomed to use about diseases—was affected with original malady.1152 For that which
did not keep the commandment was what had received the commandment; and that which
dared transgression was what had not kept the commandment; and that which specially
needed salvation was what had transgressed, and that which was assumed was what needed

salvation; so the mind was assumed. Now this point has been demonstrated, whether they
will or no, by proofs which are so to say mathematical and necessary. But you are doing just
as though, if a man were to have a diseased eye and a limping foot you were to cure the foot
but leave the eye uncured; or, if a painter had painted a picture badly, were to alter the picture,
but leave the painter alone, as though he were doing his work well. But if they are so constrained
by these arguments as to take refuge in the statement that it is possible for God to
save man, even without a mind, why then clearly He might have done so even without flesh,
by the mere expression of His will, just as He works and has worked in the universe without
a body. Away then with the flesh as well as with the mind! Let there be no inconsistency in
your absurdity.”</p>
<p>Testimony of the Holy Gregory, bishop of Nyssa. From his sermon on Abraham:—</p>
<p>“So the Word came down not naked, but after having been made flesh, not in the form
of God, but in the form of a servant.1153 This then is He who said that He could do nothing
of Himself.1154 For the not being able is the part of powerlessness. For as darkness is opposed
to light, and death to life, so is weakness to power. But yet Christ is Power of God. Power
is wholly inconsistent with not being able. For if power were powerless what is powerful?
When then the Word declares that He can do nothing it is plain that He does not attribute
his powerlessness to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, but connects his not being able
with the powerlessness of our nature. The flesh is weak, as it is written, ‘The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.’”1155</p>
<p>Of the same from his Book “on the Perfection of Life”:—</p>
<p>“Again the true lawgiver, of whom Moses was a type, hewed for Himself out of our earth
the slabs of nature. No wedlock fashioned for Him the flesh that was to receive the godhead,
but He Himself is made the hewer of His own flesh, graven as it is by the finger of God. For
the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, and the power of the Highest overshadowed her.1156
And when this had come to pass, nature once again took its indestructible character, being
made immortal by the marks of the divine finger.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his Book against Eunomius:—</p>
<p>“We assert therefore that when He said above that wisdom built for herself a house,1157

from God by falling away, nor was God made of man by advancement. I am speaking of
God and man. When, however, you attribute the passions to the flesh and the miracles to
God, you of necessity and involuntarily assign the lowly titles to the man born of Mary, and
the exalted and divine to the Word Who in the beginning was God. Wherefore in some
cases I utter exalted words, in others lowly, to the end that by means of the lofty I may shew
the nature of the indwelling Word, and by the lowly, own the weakness of the lowly flesh.

proved necessary and true.”1167</p>
<p>Testimony of the Holy John Bishop of Constantinople. From the speech which he made

Of the same from his discourse on1168 The Festival of the Nativity:—</p>
<p>“For is it not of the very last stupidity for them to bring down their own gods into stones

there is nothing disgraceful in what they either say or do, and then to find fault with us for
saying that God made a living temple for Himself of the Holy Ghost, by means of which he
brought succour to the world? For if it is disgraceful for God to dwell in a human body, then
in proportion as the stone and the wood are more worthless than man is it much more disgraceful
for him to dwell in stone and wood. But perhaps mankind seems to them to be of
less value than these senseless objects. They bring down the substance of God into stones
and into dogs;1169 but many heretics into fouler things than these. But we could never endure
even to hear of these things.1170 But what we say is that of a virgin’s womb the Christ took
pure flesh, holy and without spot, and made impervious to all sin, and restored the body1171
that was His own.”</p>

<p>A little further on: “And we assert that when the divine Word had fashioned for Himself
a holy temple by its means he brought the heavenly state into our life.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the oration: That the lowly words and deeds of Christ were not spoken
and done through lack of power, but through distinctions of dispensation.</p>
<p>“What then are the causes of many humble things having been said about Him both by
Himself and by His apostles? The first and greatest cause is the fact of His having clothed
Himself with flesh, and wishing all his contemporaries and all who have lived since, to believe
that He was not a shadow, nor what was seen merely a form, but reality of nature. For if
when He Himself and His apostles had spoken about Him so often in humble and in human
sense, the devil yet had power to persuade some wretched and miserable men to deny the
reason of the incarnation, and dare to say that He did not take flesh and so to destroy all
the ground of His love for man, how many would not have fallen into this abyss if He had
never said anything of the kind?”</p>
<p>I have now produced for you a few out of many authorities of the heralds of the truth,
not to stun you with too many. They are quite enough to show the bent of the mind of the
excellent writers. It is now for you to say what force their writings seem to have.</p>
<p>Eran.—They have all spoken in harmony with one another, and the workers in the
vineyard of the West agree with them whose husbandry is done in the region of the rising
sun. Yet I perceived a considerable difference in their sayings.</p>
<p>Orth.—They are successors of the divine apostles; some even of those apostles were
privileged to hear the holy voice and see the goodly sight. The majority of them too were
adorned with the crown of martyrdom. Does it seem right for you to wag the tongue of
blasphemy against them?</p>
<p>Eran.—I shrink from doing this; at the same time I do not approve of their great divergence.</p>
<p>Orth.—But now I will bring you an unexpected remedy. I will adduce one of your own
beautiful heresy—your teacher Apollinarius,1172 and I will shew you that he understood
the text “The Word was made flesh” just as the holy Fathers did. Hear now what he wrote
about it in his “Summary.”</p>
<p>The testimony of Apollinarius from his “Summary”:—</p>
<p>“If no one is turned into that which he assumes, and Christ assumed flesh, then He was
not turned into flesh.”</p>
<p>And immediately afterward he continues:—</p>
<p>“For also He gave himself to us in relationship by means of the body to save us. Now
that which saves is far more excellent than that which is being saved. Far more excellent
<note type="footnote">1172 cf. p. 132.</note>

<pb n="414"/>
then than we are, is He in the assumption of a body! But He would not have been more excellent
had He been turned into flesh.”</p>
<p>A little further on he says:—</p>
<p>“The simple is one, but the complex cannot be one; he then that alleges that He was
made flesh affirms the mutation of the one Word. But if the complex is also one, as man,
then he who on account of the union with the flesh says the Word was made flesh means
the one in complexity.”</p>
<p>And again a little further on he says—“To be made flesh is to be made empty,1173 but
the being made empty declares not man, but the Son of man, who ‘emptied Himself’ not by
undergoing change, but by investiture.”</p>
<p>There; you see the teacher of your own doctrines has introduced the word ‘investiture’
and indeed in his little work upon the faith he says—“We then believe that he was made
flesh, while His Godhead remained unchanged for the renewal of the manhood. For in the
holy power of God there has been neither alteration nor change of place, nor inclusion”—and
then shortly again—“We worship God who took flesh of the blessed virgin, and on this account
in the flesh is man, but in the spirit God.” And in another exposition he says—“We
confess the Son of God to have been made the Son of man, not nominally but verily, on
taking flesh of the Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>Eran.—I did not suppose that Apollinarius held these sentiments. I had other ideas
about him.</p>
<p>Orth.—Well; now you have learnt that not only the prophets and apostles, and they
who after them were ordained teachers of the world, but even Apollinarius, the writer of
heretical babbling, confesses the divine Word to be immutable, states that He was not turned
into flesh but assumed flesh, and this over and over again, as you have heard. Do not then
struggle to throw your master’s blasphemy into the shade by your own. For, says the Lord
“the disciple is not above his master.”1174</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, I confess that the divine Word of God is immutable and took flesh. It were
the uttermost foolishness to withstand authorities so many and so great.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you wish to have a solution of the rest of the difficulties?</p>
<p>Eran.—Let us put off their investigation until to-morrow.</p>
<p>Orth.—Very well; our synod is dismissed. Let us depart, and bear in mind what we have
agreed upon.</p>

<p>Eranistes and Orthodoxus.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am come as I promised. ’Tis yours to adopt one of two alternatives, and either
furnish a solution of my difficulties, or assent to what I and my friends lay down.</p>
<p>Orth.—I accept your challenge, for I think it right and fair. But we must first recall to
mind at what point we left off our discourse yesterday, and what was the conclusion of our
argument.</p>
<p>Eran.—I will remind you of the end. I remember our agreeing that the divine Word
remained immutable, and took flesh, and was not himself changed into flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem to be content with the points agreed on, for you have faithfully called
them to mind.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, and I have already said that the man that withstands teachers so many and
so great is indubitably out of his mind. I was moreover put to not a little shame to find that
Apollinarius used the same terms as the orthodox, although in his books about the incarnation
his drift has distinctly been in another direction.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then we affirm that the Divine Word took flesh?
Eran.—We do.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what do we mean by the flesh? A body only, as is the view of Arius and
Eunomius, or body and soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—Body and soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—What kind of soul? The reasonable soul, or that which is by some termed the
phytic, vegetable,1175 that is, vital? for the fable-mongering quackery of the Apollinarians
compels us to ask unseemly questions.</p>
<p>Eran.—Does then Apollinarius make a distinction of souls?1176</p>
<p>Orth.—He says that man is composed of three parts, of a body, a vital soul, and further
of a reasonable soul, which he terms mind. Holy Scripture on the contrary knows only one,
not two souls; and this is plainly taught us by the formation of the first man. For it is written
God took dust from the earth and “formed man,” and “breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life, and man became a living soul.”1177 And in the gospels the Lord said to the holy disciples
“Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear
him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”1178</p>

<p>And the very divine Moses when he told the tale of them that came down into Egypt
and stated with whom each tribal chief had come in, added, “All the souls that came out of
Egypt were seventy-five,”1179 reckoning one soul for each immigrant. And the divine apostle
at Troas, when all supposed Eutychus to be dead, said “Trouble not yourselves for his soul
is in him.”1180</p>
<p>Eran.—It is shewn clearly that each man has one soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—But Apollinarius says two; and that the Divine Word took the unreasonable,
and that instead of the reasonable, he was made in the flesh. It was on this account that I
asked what kind of soul you assert to have been assumed with the body.</p>
<p>Eran.—I say the reasonable. For I follow the Divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Orth.—We agree then that the “form of a servant” assumed by the Divine Word was
complete.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; complete.</p>
<p>Orth.—And rightly; for since the whole first man became subject to sin, and lost the
impression of the Divine Image,1181 and the race followed, it results that the Creator, with
the intention of renewing the blurred image, assumed the nature in its entirety, and stamped
an imprint far better than the first.</p>
<p>Eran.—True. But now I beg you in the first place that the meaning of the terms employed
may be made quite clear, that thus our discussion may advance without hindrance, and no
investigation of doubtful points intervene to interrupt our conversation.</p>
<p>Orth.—What you say is admirable. Ask now concerning whatever point you like.</p>
<p>Eran.—What must we call Jesus the Christ? Man?</p>
<p>Orth.—By neither name alone, but by both. For the Divine Man after being made man
was named Jesus Christ. “For,” it is written, “Thou shalt call His name Jesus for he shall save
His people from their sins,”1182 and unto you is born this day in the city of David Christ

lose.” cf. p. 164 and note.</note>

the Lord.1183 Now these are angels’ voices. But before the Incarnation he was named God,
son of God, only begotten, Lord, Divine Word, and Creator. For it is written “In the beginning
was the Word, and the word was with God, and the word was God,”1184 and “all things were
made by Him,”1185 and “He was life,”1186 and “He was the true light which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.” There are also other similar passages, declaring the divine
nature. But after the Incarnation He was named Jesus and Christ.</p>
<p>Eran.—Therefore the Lord Jesus is God only.</p>
<p>Orth.—You hear that the divine Word was made man, and do you call him God only?</p>
<p>Eran.—Since He became man without being changed, but remained just what He was
before, we must call Him just what He was.</p>
<p>Orth.—The divine Word was and is and will be immutable. But when He had taken
man’s nature He became man. It behoves us therefore to confess both natures, both that
which took, and that which was taken.</p>
<p>Eran.—We must name Him by the nobler.</p>
<p>Orth—Man,—I mean man the animal,—is he a simple or a composite being?</p>
<p>Eran.—Composite.</p>
<p>Orth.—Composed of what component parts?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of a body and a soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—And of these natures whether is nobler?</p>
<p>Eran.—Clearly the soul, for it is reasonable and immortal, and has been entrusted with
the sovereignty of the animal. But the body is mortal and perishable, and without the soul
is unreasonable, and a corpse.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then the divine Scripture ought to have called the animal after its more excellent
part.</p>
<p>Eran.—It does so call it, for it calls them that came out of Egypt souls. For with seventyfive
souls, it says, Israel came down into Egypt.
Orth.—But does the divine Scripture never call any one after the body?</p>
<p>Eran.—It calls them that are the slaves of flesh, flesh. For “God,” it is written, “said my
spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.”1187</p>
<p>Orth.—But without blame no one is called flesh?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do not remember.</p>

<p>Orth.—Then I will remind you, and point out to you that even the very saints are called
“flesh.” Answer now. What would you call the apostles? Spiritual, or fleshly?</p>
<p>Eran.—Spiritual;—and leaders and teachers of the spiritual.</p>
<p>Orth.—Hear now the holy Paul when he says “But when it pleased God who separated
me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his son in me that I might
preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither
went I up to them that were apostles before me.”1188 Does he so style the apostles because
he blames them?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—Is it not that he names them after their visible nature, and comparing the calling
which is of men with that which is of heaven?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then hear too the psalmist David—“Unto thee shall all flesh come.”1189 Hear
too, the prophet Isaiah foretelling “All flesh shall see the salvation of our God.”1190</p>
<p>Eran.—It is made perfectly plain that Holy Scripture names human nature from the
flesh without the least blame.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will proceed to give you the yet further proof.</p>
<p>Eran.—What further?</p>
<p>Orth.—The fact that sometimes when giving blame the divine Scripture uses only the
name of soul.</p>
<p>Eran.—And where will you find this in holy Scripture?</p>
<p>Orth.—Hear the Lord God speaking through the prophet Ezekiel “The soul that sinneth
it shall die.”1191 Moreover through the great Moses He saith “If a soul sin—”1192 And again
“It shall come to pass that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be cut off.”1193
And many other passages of the same kind may be found.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is plainly proved.</p>
<p>Orth.—In cases, then, where there is a certain natural union, and a combination of
created things, and of beings connected by service and by time, it is not the custom of holy
Scripture to use a name for this being derived only from the nobler nature; it names it indiscriminately
both by the meaner and by the nobler. If so, how can you find fault with us for

calling Christ the Lord, man, after confessing Him to be God, when many things combine
to compel us to do so?</p>
<p>Eran.—What is there to compel us to call the Saviour Christ, “man”?</p>
<p>Orth.—The diverse and mutually inconsistent opinions of the heretics.</p>
<p>Eran.—What opinions, and contrary to what?</p>
<p>Orth.—That of Arius to that of Sabellius. The one divides the substances: the other
confounds the hypostases. Arius introduces three substances, and Sabellius makes one hypostasis
instead of three.1194 Tell me now, how ought we to heal both maladies? Must we
apply the same drug for both ailments, or for each the proper one?</p>
<p>Eran.—For each the proper one.</p>
<p>Orth.—We shall therefore endeavour to persuade Arius to acknowledge the substance
of the Holy Trinity, and we shall adduce proofs of this position from Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes: this ought to be done.</p>
<p>Orth.—But in arguing with Sabellius we shall adopt the opposite course. Concerning
the substance we shall advance no argument, for even he acknowledges but one.</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—But we shall do our best to cure the unsound part of his doctrine.</p>
<p>Eran.—We say that where he halts is about the hypostases.</p>
<p>Orth.—Since then he asserts there to be one hypostasis of the Trinity, we shall point out
to him that the divine Scripture proclaims three hypostases.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is the course to take. But we have wandered from the subject.</p>
<p>Orth.—Not at all. We are collecting proofs of it, as you will learn in a moment. But tell
me, do you understand that all the heresies which derive their name from Christ, acknowledge
both the Godhead of Christ and His manhood?</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do not some acknowledge the godhead alone, and some the manhood alone?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And some but a part of the manhood?</p>
<p>Eran.—I think so. But it will be well for us to lay down the names of the holders of these
different opinions, that the point under discussion may be made plainer.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will tell you the names. Simon, Menander, Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides,
Bardesanes, Cerdo, and Manes, openly denied the humanity of Christ. On the other hand
Artemon, Theodotus, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Marcellus, and Photinus, fell into the
diametrically opposite blasphemy; for they preach Christ to be man only, and deny the
Godhead which existed before the ages. Arius and Eunomius make the Godhead of the only
begotten a created Godhead, and maintain that He assumed only a body. Apollinarius
<note type="footnote">1194 Vide note on page 36.</note>

<pb n="420"/>
confesses that the assumed body was a living1195 body, but in his work deprives the reasonable
soul alike of its honour and of its salvation. This is the contrariety of these corrupt opinions.
But do you, with all due love of truth, tell us, must we institute a discussion with these men,
or shall we let them go dashed down headlong and howling to their doom?</p>
<p>Eran.—It is inhuman to neglect the sick.</p>
<p>Orth.—Very well; then we must compassionate them, and do our best to heal them.</p>
<p>Eran.—By all means.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then you had scientifically learned how to cure the body, and round you stood
many men asking you to cure them, and shewing their various ailments, such as arise from
running at the eyes, injury to the ears, tooth-ache, contraction of the joints, palsy, bile, or
phlegm, what would you have done? Tell me; would you have applied the same treatment
to all, or to each that which was appropriate?</p>
<p>Eran.—I should certainly have given to each the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>Orth.—So by applying cold treatment to the hot, and heating the cold, and loosing the
strained, and giving tension to the loose, and drying the moist, and moistening the dry, you
would have driven out the diseases and restored the health which they had expelled.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is the treatment prescribed by medical science, for contraries, it is said, are
the remedies of contraries.</p>
<p>Orth.—If you were a gardener, would you give the same treatment to all plants? or their
own to the mulberry and the fig, and so to the pear, to the apple, and to the vine what is
fitting to each, and in a word to each plant its own proper culture?</p>
<p>Eran.—It is obvious that each plant requires its own treatment.</p>
<p>Orth.—And if you undertook to be a ship builder, and saw that the mast wanted repair,
would you try to mend it in the same way as you would the tiller? or would you give it the
proper treatment of a mast?</p>
<p>Eran.—There is no question about these things: everything demands its own treatment,
be it plant or limb or gear or tackle.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then is it not monstrous to apply to the body and to things without life to each
its own appropriate treatment, and not to keep this rule of treatment in the case of the soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—Most unjust; nay, rather stupid than unrighteous. They who adopt any other
method are quite unskilled in the healing art.
Orth.—Then in disputing against each heresy we shall use the appropriate remedy?</p>
<p>Eran.—By all means.</p>
<p>Orth.—And it is fitting treatment to add what is wanting and to remove what is superfluous?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<note type="footnote">1195 ἔμψυχον</note>

<pb n="421"/>
<p>Orth.—In endeavouring then to cure Photinus and Marcellus and their adherents, in
order to carry out the rule of treatment, what should we add?</p>
<p>Eran.—The acknowledgment of the Godhead of Christ, for it is this that they lack.</p>
<p>Orth.—But about the manhood we will say nothing to them, for they acknowledge the
Lord Christ to be man.</p>
<p>Eran.—You are right.</p>
<p>Orth.—And in arguing with Arius and Eunomius about the incarnation of the only begotten,
what should we persuade them to add to their own confession?</p>
<p>Eran.—The assumption of the soul; for they say that the divine Word took only a body.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what does Apollinarius lack to make his teaching accurate about the incarnation?</p>
<p>Eran.—Not to separate the mind from the soul, but to confess that, with the body, was
assumed a reasonable soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then shall we dispute with him on this point?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—But under this head what did we assert to be confessed, and what altogether
denied, by Marcion, Valentinus, Manes and their adherents?</p>
<p>Eran.—That they admitted their belief in the Godhead of Christ, but do not accept the
doctrine of His manhood.</p>
<p>Orth.—We shall therefore do our best to persuade them to accept also the doctrine of
the manhood, and not to call the divine incarnation1196 a mere appearance.</p>
<p>Eran.—It will be well so to do.</p>
<p>Orth.—We will therefore tell them that it is right to style the Christ not only God, but
also man.</p>
<p>Eran.—By all means.</p>
<p>Orth.—And how is it possible for us to induce others to style the Christ ‘man’ while we
excuse ourselves from doing so? They will not yield to our persuasion, but on the contrary
will convict us of agreeing with them.</p>
<p>Eran.—And how can we, confessing as we do that the divine Word took flesh and a
reasonable soul, agree with them?</p>
<p>Orth.—If we confess the fact, why then shun the word?</p>
<p>Eran.—It is right to name the Christ from His nobler qualities.</p>
<p>Orth.—Keep this rule then. Do not speak of Him as crucified, nor yet as risen from the
dead, and so on.</p>
<p>Eran.—But these are the names of the sufferings of salvation. Denial of the sufferings
implies denial of the salvation.</p>
<note type="footnote">1196 οἰκονουίαν. cf. p. 72, note.</note>

<pb n="422"/>
<p>Orth.—And the name Man is the name of a nature. Not to pronounce the name is to
deny the nature: denial of the nature is denial of the sufferings, and denial of the sufferings
does away with the salvation.</p>
<p>Eran.—I hold it profitable to acknowledge the assumed nature; but to style the Saviour
of the world man is to belittle the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you then deem yourself wiser than Peter and Paul; aye, and than the Saviour
Himself? For the Lord said to the Jews “Why do ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you
the truth, which I heard of my Father?”1197 And He frequently called Himself Son of Man.</p>
<p>And the meritorious Peter, in his sermon to the Jewish people, says,—“Ye men of Israel,
hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you.”1198 And the
blessed Paul, when bringing the message of salvation to the chiefs of the Areopagus, among
many other things said this,—</p>
<p>“And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere
to repent: Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in
righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto
all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.”1199 He then who excuses himself from
using the name appointed and preached by the Lord and his Apostles deems himself wiser
than even these great instructors, aye, even than the very well-spring of the wisest.</p>
<p>Eran.—They gave this instruction to the unbelievers. Now the greater part of the
world1200 has professed the faith.</p>
<p>Orth.—But we have still among us Jews and pagans and of heretics systems innumerable,
and to each of these we must give fit and appropriate teaching. But, supposing we were all
of one mind, tell me now, what harm is there in calling the Christ both God and man? Do
we not behold in Him perfect Godhead, and manhood likewise lacking in nothing?</p>
<p>Eran.—This we have owned again and again.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why then deny what we have again and again owned?</p>
<p>Eran.—I hold it unnecessary to call the Christ ‘man,’—especially when believer is conversing
with believer.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you consider the divine Apostle a believer?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes: a teacher of all believers.</p>
<p>Orth.—And do you deem Timothy worthy of being so styled?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes: both as a disciple of the Apostle, and as a teacher of the rest.</p>

<p>Orth.—Very well: then hear the teacher of teachers writing to his very perfect disciple.
“There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who
gave himself a ransom for all.”1201 Do stop your idle prating, and laying down the law about
divine names. Moreover in this passage that very name ‘mediator’ stands indicative both of
Godhead and of manhood. He is called a mediator because He does not exist as God alone;
for how, if He had had nothing of our nature could He have mediated between us and God?
But since as God He is joined with God as having the same substance, and as man with us,
because from us He took the form of a servant, He is properly termed a mediator, uniting
in Himself distinct qualities by the unity of natures of Godhead, I mean, and of manhood.1202</p>
<p>Eran.—But was not Moses called a mediator, though only a man?1203</p>
<p>Orth.—He was a type of the reality: but the type has not all the qualities of the reality.
Wherefore though Moses was not by nature God, yet, to fulfil the type, he was called a god.
For He says “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh.”1204 And then directly afterwards he
assigns him also a Prophet as though to God, for “Aaron thy brother,” He says, “shall be thy
Prophet.”1205 But the reality is by nature God, and by nature man.</p>
<p>Eran.—But who would call one not having the distinct characteristics of the archetype,
a type?</p>
<p>Orth.—The imperial images, it seems, you do not call images of the emperor.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet they have not all the characteristics which their archetype has. For in the
first place they have neither life nor reason; secondly they have no inner organs, heart, I
mean, and belly and liver and the adjacent parts. Further they present the appearance of the
organs of sense, but perform none of their functions, for they neither hear, nor speak, nor
see; they cannot write; they cannot walk, nor perform any other human action; and yet they
are called imperial statues. In this sense Moses was a mediator and Christ was a mediator;
but the former as an image and type and the latter as reality. But that I may make this point
clearer to you from yet another authority, call to mind the words used of Melchisedec in
the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Eran.—What words?</p>
<p>Orth.—Those in which the divine Apostle comparing the Levitical priesthood with that
of the Christ likens Melchisedec in other respects to the Lord Christ, and says that the Lord
had the priesthood after the order of Melchisedec.1206</p>
<note type="footnote">1201 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6</note>

<pb n="424"/>
<p>Eran.—I think the words of the divine Apostle are as follows;—“For this Melchisedec,
king of Salem, priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter
of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace;
without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end
of life; but made like unto the son of God; abideth a priest continually.”1207 I presume you
spoke of this passage.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes, I spoke of this; and I must praise you for not mutilating it, but for quoting
the whole. Tell me now, does each one of these points fit Melchisedec in nature and reality?</p>
<p>Eran.—Who has the audacity to deny a fitness where the divine apostle has asserted it?</p>
<p>Orth.—Then you say that all this fits Melchisedec by nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you say that he was a man, or assumed some other nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—A man.</p>
<p>Orth.—Begotten or unbegotten?</p>
<p>Eran.—You are asking very absurd questions.</p>
<p>Orth.—The fault lies with you for openly opposing the truth. Answer then.</p>
<p>Eran.—There is one only unbegotten, who is God and Father.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then we assert that Melchisedec was begotten?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—But the passage about him teaches the opposite. Remember the words which
you quoted a moment ago, “Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
beginning of days nor end of life.” How then do the words “Without father and without
mother” fit him; and how the statement that he neither received beginning of existence nor
end, since all this transcends humanity?</p>
<p>Eran.—These things do in fact overstep the limits of human nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then shall we say that the Apostle told lies?</p>
<p>Eran.—God forbid.</p>
<p>Orth.—How then is it possible both to testify to the truth of the Apostle, and apply the
supernatural to Melchisedec?</p>
<p>Eran.—The passage is a very difficult one, and requires much explanation.</p>
<p>Orth.—For any one willing to consider it with attention it will not be hard to attain
perception of the meaning of the words. After saying “without father, without mother,
without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,” the divine Apostle adds
“made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest continually.”1208 Here he plainly teaches
<note type="footnote">1207 Hebrews vii. 1, 2, 3</note>
<note type="footnote">1208 Heb. vii. 3</note>

<pb n="425"/>
us that the Lord Christ is archetype of Melchisedec in things concerning the human nature.
And he speaks of Melchisedec as “made like unto the Son of God.” Now let us examine the
point in this manner;—do you say that the Lord had a father according to the flesh?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why?</p>
<p>Eran.—He was born of the holy Virgin alone.</p>
<p>Orth.—He is therefore properly styled “without father”?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you say that according to the divine Nature He had a mother?1209</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—For He was begotten of the Father alone before the ages?</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—And yet, as the generation He has of the Father is ineffable, He is spoken of as
“without descent.” “Who” says the prophet “shall declare His generation?”1210</p>
<p>Eran.—You are right.</p>
<p>Orth.—Thus it becomes Him to have neither beginning of days nor end of life; for He
is without beginning, indestructible, and, in a word, eternal, and coeternal with the Father.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is my view too. But we must now consider how this fits the admirable
Melchisedec.</p>
<p>Orth.—As an image and type. The image, as we have just observed, has not all the
properties of the archetype. Thus to the Saviour these qualities are proper both by nature
and in reality; but the story of the origin of the race has attributed them to Melchisedec. For
after telling us of the father of the patriarch Abraham, and of the father and mother of Isaac,
and in like manner of Jacob and of his sons, and exhibiting the pedigree of our first forefathers,
of Melchisedec it records neither the father nor the mother, nor does it teach that he
traced his descent from any one of Noah’s sons, to the end that he may be a type of Him
who is in reality without father, and without mother. And this is what the divine Apostle
would have us understand, for in this very passage he says further, “But he whose descent
is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.”
1211</p>
<p>Eran.—Then, since Holy Scripture has not mentioned his parents, can he be called
without father and without mother?</p>
<note type="footnote">1209 The bearing of this on Theodoret’s relation to Nestorianism will be observed.</note>
<note type="footnote">1210 Is. liii. 8</note>
<note type="footnote">1211 Heb. vii. 6</note>

<pb n="426"/>
<p>Orth.—If he had really been without father and without mother, he would not have
been an image, but a reality. But since these are his qualities not by nature, but according
to the dispensation of the Divine Scripture, he exhibits the type of the reality.</p>
<p>Eran.—The type must have the character of the archetype.</p>
<p>Orth.—Is man called an image of God?</p>
<p>Eran.—Man is not an image of God, but was made in the image of God.1212</p>
<p>Orth.—Listen then to the Apostle. He says: “For a man indeed ought not to cover his
head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.”1213</p>
<p>Eran.—Granted, then, that he is an image of God.
189</p>
<p>Orth.—According to your argument then he must needs have plainly preserved the
characters of the archetype, and have been uncreate, uncompounded, and infinite. He ought
in like manner to have been able to create out of the non existent, he ought to have fashioned
all things by his word and without labour, in addition to this to have been free from sickness,
sorrow, anger, and sin, to have been immortal and incorruptible and to possess all the
qualities of the archetype.</p>
<p>Eran.—Man is not an image of God in every respect.</p>
<p>Orth.—Though truly an image in the qualities in which you would grant him to be so,
you will find that he is separated by a wide interval from the reality.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Consider now too this point. The divine Apostle calls the Son the image of the
Father; for he says “Who is the image of the invisible God?”1214</p>
<p>Eran.—What then; has not the Son all the qualities of the Father?</p>
<p>Orth.—He is not Father. He is not uncaused. He is not unbegotten.</p>
<p>Eran.—If He were He would not be Son.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then does not what I said hold good; the image has not all the qualities of the
archetype?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Thus too the divine Apostle said that Melchisedec is made like unto the Son of
God.1215</p>
<p>Eran.—Suppose we grant that he is without Father and without Mother and without
descent, as you have said. But how are we to understand his having neither beginning of
days nor end of life?</p>
<note type="footnote">1212 Gen. i. 27</note>

<pb n="427"/>
<p>Orth.—The holy Moses when writing the ancient genealogy tells us how Adam being
so many years old begat Seth,1216 and when he had lived so many years he ended his life.1217
So too he writes of Seth, of Enoch, and of the rest, but of Melchisedec he mentions neither
beginning of existence nor end of life. Thus as far as the story goes he has neither beginning
of days nor end of life, but in truth and reality the only begotten Son of God never began to
exist and shall never have an end.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then, so far as what belongs to God and is really divine is concerned,
Melchisedec is a type of the Lord Christ; but as far as the priesthood is concerned, which
belongs rather to man than to God, the Lord Christ was made a priest after the order of
Melchisedec.1218 For Melchisedec was a high priest of the people, and the Lord Christ for
all men has made the right holy offering of salvation.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have spent many words on this matter.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet more were needed, as you know, for you said the point was a difficult one.</p>
<p>Eran.—Let us return to the question before us.</p>
<p>Orth.—What was the question?</p>
<p>Eran.—On my remarking that Christ must not be called man, but only God, you yourself
besides many other testimonies adduced also the well known words of the Apostle which
he has used in his epistle Timothy—“One God, one mediator between God and men, the
man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.”1219</p>
<p>Orth.—I remember from what point we diverged into this digression. It was when I had
said that the name of mediator exhibits the two natures of the Saviour, and you said that
Moses was called a mediator though he was only a man and not God and man. I was therefore
under the necessity of following up these points to show that the type has not all the qualities
of the archetype. Tell me, then, whether you allow that the Saviour ought also to be called
man.</p>
<p>Eran.—I call Him God, for He is God’s Son.</p>
<p>Orth.—If you call him God, because you have learnt that he is God’s Son, call him also
man, for he often called Himself “Son of Man.”</p>
<p>Eran.—The name man does not apply to Him in the same way as the name God.</p>
<p>Orth.—As not really belonging to Him or for some other reason?</p>
<p>Eran.—God is his name by nature; man is the designation of the Incarnation.1220</p>

<pb n="428"/>
<p>Orth.—But are we to look on the Incarnation as real, or as something imaginary and
false?</p>
<p>Eran.—As real.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then the grace of the Incarnation is real, and what we call Incarnation is the
divine Word’s being made man, then the name man is real; for after taking man’s nature
He is called man.</p>
<p>Eran.—Before His passion He was styled man, but afterward He was no longer so styled.</p>
<p>Orth.—But it was after the Passion and the Resurrection that the divine Apostle wrote
the Epistle to Timothy wherein he speaks of the Saviour Christ as man,1221 and writing after
the Passion and the Resurrection to the Corinthians he exclaims “For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”1222 And in order to make his
meaning clear he adds, “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”1223
And after the Passion and the Resurrection the divine Peter, in his address to the Jews, called
Him man.1224 And after His being taken up into heaven, Stephen the victorious, amid the
storm of stones, said to the Jews, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God.”1225 Are we to suppose ourselves wiser than the illustrious
heralds of the truth?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do not suppose myself wiser than the holy doctors, but I fail to find the use of
the name.</p>
<p>Orth.—How then could you persuade them that deny the incarnation of the Lord,
Marcionists, I mean, and Manichees, and all the rest who are thus unsound, to accept the
teaching of the truth, unless you adduce these and similar proofs with the object of shewing
that the Lord Christ is not God only but also man?</p>
<p>Eran.—Perhaps it is necessary to adduce them.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why not then teach the faithful the reality of the doctrine? Are you forgetful of
the apostolic precept enjoining us to be “ready to give an answer.”1226 Now let us look at
the matter in this light. Does the best general engage the enemy, attack with arrows and
javelins, and endeavour to break their column all alone, or does he also arm his men, and
marshal them, and rouse their hearts to play the man?</p>
<p>Eran.—He ought rather to do this latter.</p>

<p>Orth.—Yes; for it is not the part of a general to expose his own life, and take his place
in the ranks, and let his men go fast asleep, but rather to keep them awake for their work at
their post.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—This is what the divine Paul did, for in writing to them who had made profession
of their faith he said, “Take unto you the whole armour of God that ye be able to stand
against the wiles of the Devil.”1227 And again, “Stand therefore with your loins girt about
with truth,”1228 and so on. Bear in mind too what we have already said, that a physician
supplies what nature lacks. Does he find the cold redundant? He supplies the hot, and so
on with the rest; and this is what the Lord does.</p>
<p>Eran.—And where will you show that the Lord has done this?</p>
<p>Orth.—In the holy gospels.</p>
<p>Eran.—Show me then and fulfil your promise.</p>
<p>Orth.—What did the Jews consider our Saviour Christ?</p>
<p>Eran.—A man.</p>
<p>Orth.—And that He was also God they were wholly ignorant.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—Was it not then necessary for the ignorant to learn?</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Listen to Him then saying to them: “Many good works have I shewed you from
my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me?”1229 And when they replied: “For a
good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that thou being a man makest
thyself God,”1230 He added “It is written in your law I said ye are gods. If he called them
gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him
whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest, because I said
I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my father believe me not<gap reason="omitted"/>that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me.”1231</p>
<p>Eran.—In the passages you have just read you have shewn that the Lord shewed Himself
to the Jews to be God and not man.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes, for they did not need to learn what they knew; that He was a man they
knew, but they did not know that He was from the beginning God. He adopted this same
course in the case of the Pharisees; for when He saw them accosting Him as a mere man He

asked them “What think ye of Christ? Whose son is He?”1232 And when they said “Of
David” He went on “How then doth David calling him Lord say ‘The Lord said unto my
Lord sit thou on my right hand.’”1233 Then He goes on to argue, “If then He is His Lord
how is He His Son?”</p>
<p>Eran.—You have brought testimony against yourself, for the Lord plainly taught the
Pharisees to call Him not “Son of David” but “Lord of David.” Wherefore He is distinctly
shown wishing to be called God and not man.</p>
<p>Orth.—I am afraid you have not attended to the divine teaching. He did not repudiate
the name of “Son of David,” but He added that He ought also to be believed to be Lord of
David. This He clearly shews in the words “If He is his Lord how is He then his Son?” He
did not say “if He is Lord He is not Son,” but “how is He his Son?” instead of saying in one
respect He is Lord and in another Son. These passages both distinctly show the Godhead
and the manhood.</p>
<p>Eran.—There is no need of argument. The Lord distinctly teaches that He does not wish
to be called Son of David.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then He ought to have told the blind men and the woman of Canaan and the
multitude not to call Him Son of David, and yet the blind men cried out “Thou Son of
David have mercy on us.”1234 And the woman of Canaan “Have mercy on me O Son of
David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a Devil.”1235 And the multitude: “Hosanna to
the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.”1236 And not only did
He not take it ill, but even praised their faith; for the blind He freed from their long weary
night and granted them the power of sight; the maddened and distraught daughter of the
woman of Canaan He healed and drove out the wicked demon; and when the chief priests
and Pharisees were offended at them that shouted “Hosanna to the Son of David” He did
not merely not prevent them from shouting, but even sanctioned their acclamation, for,
said He, “I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry
out.”1237</p>
<p>Eran.—He put up with this style of address before the resurrection in condescension
to the weakness of them that had not yet properly believed. But after the resurrection these
names are needless.</p>

<p>Eran.—It is wrong to joke about serious things.</p>
<p>Orth.—It is wrong to make light of the reading of the divine oracles.</p>
<p>Eran.—And who is such a wretch as to despise his own salvation?</p>
<p>Orth.—Answer my question, and then you will learn your ignorance.</p>
<p>Eran.—What question?</p>
<p>Orth.—Where are we to rank the divine Apostle?</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly among the most perfect, and one of the perfect teachers.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when did he begin his teaching?</p>
<p>Eran.—After the ascension of the Saviour, the coming of the Spirit, and the stoning of
the victorious Stephen.</p>
<p>Orth.—Paul, at the very end of his life, when writing his last letter to his disciple Timothy,
and in giving him, as it were, his paternal inheritance by will, added “Remember that Jesus
Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.”1238 Then he
went on to mention his sufferings on behalf of the gospel, and thus showed its truth saying,
“Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds.”1239</p>
<p>It were easy for me to adduce many similar testimonies, but I have judged it needless
to do so.</p>
<p>Eran.—You promised to prove that the Lord supplied the lacking instruction to them
that needed, and you have shown that He discoursed about His own Godhead to the Pharisees,
and to the rest of the Jews. But that He gave also His instruction about the flesh you
have not shewn.</p>
<p>Orth.—It would have been quite superfluous to have discoursed about the flesh which
was before their eyes, for He was plainly seen eating and drinking and toiling and sleeping.
Furthermore, to omit the many and various events before the passion, after His resurrection
He proved to His disbelieving disciples not His Godhead but His manhood; for He said,
“Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself. Handle me and see for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones as ye see me have.”1240</p>
<p>Now I have fulfilled my promise, for we have proved the giving of instruction about the
Godhead to them that were ignorant of the Godhead, and about the resurrection of the flesh
to them that denied this latter. Cease therefore from contending, and confess the two natures
of the Saviour.</p>
<p>Eran.—There were two before the union, but, after combining, they made one nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—When do you say that the union was effected?</p>
<p>Eran.—I say at the exact moment of the conception.</p>
<note type="footnote">1238 2 Tim. ii. 8</note>
<note type="footnote">1239 2 Tim. ii. 9</note>
<note type="footnote">1240 Luke xxiv. 39</note>

<pb n="432"/>
<p>Orth.—And do you deny that the divine Word existed before the conception?</p>
<p>Eran.—I say that He was before the ages.</p>
<p>Orth.—And that the flesh was co-existent with Him?</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—But was formed, after the salutation of the angel, of the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>Eran.—So I say.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore before the union there were not two natures but only one. For if the
Godhead pre-existed, but the manhood was not co-existent, being formed after the angelic
salutation, and the union being coincident with the formation, then before the union there
was one nature, that which exists always and existed before the ages. Now let us again consider
this point. Do you understand the making of flesh or becoming man to be anything other
than the union?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—For when He took flesh He was made flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the union coincides with the taking flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—So I say.</p>
<p>Orth.—So before the making man there was one nature. For if both union and making
man are identical, and He was made man by taking man’s nature, and the form of God took
the form of a servant, then before the union the divine nature was one.</p>
<p>Eran.—And how are the union and the making man identical?</p>
<p>Orth.—A moment ago you confessed that there is no distinction between these terms.</p>
<p>Eran.—You led me astray by your arguments.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then, if you like, let us go over the same ground again.</p>
<p>Eran.—We had better so do.</p>
<p>Orth.—Is there a distinction between the incarnation and the union, according to the
nature of the transaction?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly; a very great distinction.</p>
<p>Orth.—Explain fully the character of this distinction.</p>
<p>Eran.—Even the sense of the terms shows the distinction, for the word “incarnation”
shows the taking of the flesh, while the word “union” indicates the combination of distinct
things.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you represent the incarnation to be anterior to the union?</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—You say that the union took place in the conception?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore if not even the least moment of time intervened between the taking
of flesh and the union, and the assumed nature did not precede the assumption and the

<pb n="433"/>
union, then incarnation and union signify one and the same thing, and so before the union
and incarnation there was one nature, while after the incarnation we speak properly of two,
of that which took and of that which was taken.</p>
<p>Eran.—I say that Christ was of two natures, but I deny two natures.</p>
<p>Orth.—Explain to us then in what sense you understand the expression “of two natures;”
like gilded silver? like the composition of electron?1241 like the solder made of lead and tin?</p>
<p>Eran.—I deny that the union is like any of these; it is ineffable, and passes all understanding.</p>
<p>Orth.—I too confess that the manner of the union cannot be comprehended. But I have
at all events been instructed by the divine Scripture that each nature remains unimpaired
after the union.</p>
<p>Eran.—And where is this taught in the divine Scripture?</p>
<p>Orth.—It is all full of this teaching.</p>
<p>Eran.—Give proof of what you assert.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do you not acknowledge the properties of each nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—No: not, that is, after the union.
Orth.—Let us then learn this very point from the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am ready to obey the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Orth.—When, then, you hear the divine John exclaiming “In the beginning was the
word, and the word was with God, and the word was God”1242 and “By Him all things were
made”1243 and the rest of the parallel passages, do you affirm that the flesh, or the divine
Word, begotten before the ages of the Father, was in the beginning with God, and was by
nature God, and made all things?</p>
<p>Eran.—I say that these things belong to God the Word. But I do not separate Him from
the flesh made one with Him.</p>
<p>Orth.—Neither do we separate the flesh from God the Word, nor do we make the union
a confusion.</p>
<p>Eran.—I recognise one nature after the union.</p>
<p>Orth.—When did the Evangelists write the gospel? Was it before the union, or a very
long time after the union?</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly after the union, the nativity, the miracles, the passion, the resurrection,
the taking up into heaven, and the coming of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<note type="footnote">1241 The metallic compound called electron is described by Strabo p. 146 as the mixed residuum, or scouring,
(κάθαρμα) left after the first smelting of gold ore. Pliny (H. N. xxxiii. 23) describes it as containing 1 part silver
to 4 gold. cf. Soph. Antig. 1038, and Herod. i. 50.</note>

<pb n="434"/>
<p>Orth.—Hear then John saying “In the beginning was the word, and the word was with
God, and the word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
Him, and without Him was not anything made”1244 and so on. Hear too Matthew, “The
book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David,—Son of Abraham,”—and so on.1245
Luke too traced His genealogy to Abraham and David.1246 Now make the former and the
latter quotation fit one nature. You will find it impossible, for existence in the beginning,
and descent from Abraham,—the making of all things, and derivation from a created forefather,
are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Eran.—By thus arguing you divide the only begotten son into two Persons.</p>
<p>Orth.—One Son of God I both know and adore, the Lord Jesus Christ; but I have been
taught the difference between His Godhead and his manhood. You, however, who say that
there is only one nature after the union, do you make this agree with the introductions of
the Evangelists.</p>
<p>Eran.—You appear to assume the proposition to be hard, nay impossible. Be it, I beg,
short and easy;—only solve our question.</p>
<p>Orth.—Both qualities are proper to the Lord Christ,—existence from the beginning,
and generation, according to the flesh, from Abraham and David.</p>
<p>Eran.—You laid down the law that after the union it is not right to speak of one nature.
Take heed lest in mentioning the flesh you transgress your own law.</p>
<p>Orth.—Even without mentioning the flesh it is quite easy to explain the point in question,
for I am applying both to the Saviour Christ.</p>
<p>Eran.—I too assert that both these qualities belong to the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; but you do so in contemplation of two natures in Him, and applying to
each its own properties. But if the Christ is one nature, how is it possible to attribute to it
properties which are inconsistent with one another? For to have derived origin from Abraham
and David, and still more to have been born many generations after David, is inconsistent
with existence in the beginning. Again to have sprung from created beings is inconsistent
with being Creator of all things; to have had human fathers with existence derived from
God. In short the new is inconsistent with the eternal.</p>
<p>Let us also look at the matter in this way. Do we say that the divine Word is Creator of
the Universe?</p>
<p>Eran.—So we have learnt to believe from the divine Scriptures.</p>
<p>Orth.—And how many days after the creation of heaven and earth are we told that
Adam was formed?</p>
<note type="footnote">1244 John i. 1–3</note>
<note type="footnote">1245 Matt. i. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">1246 Luke iii. 23</note>

<pb n="435"/>
<p>Eran.—On the sixth day.</p>
<p>Orth.—And from Adam to Abraham how many generations went by?</p>
<p>Eran.—I think twenty.</p>
<p>Orth.—And from Abraham to Christ our Saviour how many generations are reckoned
by the Evangelist Matthew.</p>
<p>Eran.—Forty-two.1247</p>
<p>Orth.—If then the Lord Christ is one nature how can He be Creator of all things visible
and invisible and, at the same time, after so many generations, have been formed by the
Holy Ghost in a virgin’s womb? And how could He be at one and the same time Creator of
Adam and Son of Adam’s descendants?
Eran.—I have already said that both these properties are appropriate to Him as God
made flesh, for I recognise one nature made flesh of the Word.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor yet, my good sir, do we say that two natures of the divine Word were made
flesh, for we know that the nature of the divine Word is one, but we have been taught that
the flesh of which He availed Himself when He was incarnate is of another nature, and here
I think that you too agree with me. Tell me now; after what manner do you say that the
making flesh took place?</p>
<p>Eran.—I know not the manner, but I believe that He was made flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—You make a pretext of your ignorance unfairly, and after the fashion of the
Pharisees. For they when they beheld the force of the Lord’s enquiry, and suspecting that
they were on the point of conviction, uttered their reply “We do not know.”1248 But I proclaim
quite openly that the divine incarnation is without change. For if by any variation or
change He was made flesh, then after the change all that is divine in His names and in His
deeds is quite inappropriate to Him.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have agreed again and again that God the Word is immutable.</p>
<p>Orth.—He was made flesh by taking flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—The nature of God the Word made flesh is different from that of the flesh, by
assumption of which the nature of the divine Word was made flesh and became man.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Was He then changed into flesh?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then He was made flesh, not by mutation, but by taking flesh, and both the
former and the latter qualities are appropriate to Him as to God made flesh, as you said a
moment ago, then the natures were not confounded, but remained unimpaired. And as long

<note type="footnote">1248 Matt. xxi. 27. A.V. “We cannot tell.”</note>

<pb n="436"/>
as we hold thus we shall perceive too the harmony of the Evangelists, for while the one
proclaims the divine attributes of the one only begotten—the Lord Christ—the other sets
forth His human qualities. So too Christ our Lord Himself teaches us, at one time calling
Himself Son of God and at another Son of man: at one time He gives honour to His Mother
as to her that gave Him birth;1249 at another He rebukes her as her Lord.1250 At one time
He finds no fault with them that style Him Son of David; at another He teaches the ignorant
that He is not only David’s Son but also David’s Lord.1251 He calls Nazareth and Capernaum
His country,1252 and again He exclaims “Before Abraham was I am.”1253 You will find the
divine Scripture full of similar passages, and they all point not to one nature but to two.</p>
<p>Eran.—He who contemplates two natures in the Christ divides the one only begotten
into two sons.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; and he who says Paul is made up of soul and body makes two Pauls out of
one.</p>
<p>Eran.—The analogy does not hold good.</p>
<p>Orth.—I know it does not,1254 for here the union is a natural union of parts that are
coæval, created, and fellow slaves, but in the case of the Lord Christ all is of good will, of
love to man, and of grace. Here too, though the union is natural, the proper qualities of the
natures remain unimpaired.</p>
<p>Eran.—If the proper qualities of the natures remain distinct, how does the soul together
with the body crave for food?</p>
<p>Orth.—The soul does not crave for food. How could it when it is immortal? But the
body, which derives its vital force from the soul, feels its need, and desires to receive what
is lacking. So after toil it longs for rest, after waking for sleep, and so with the rest of its desires.
So forthwith after its dissolution, since it has no longer its vital energy, it does not even
crave for what is lacking, and, ceasing to receive it, it undergoes corruption.</p>
<p>Eran.—You see that to thirst and to hunger and similar appetites belong to the soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—Did these belong to the soul it would suffer hunger and thirst, and the similar
wants, even after its release from the body.</p>
<p>Eran.—What then do you say to be proper to the soul?1255</p>

<p>Orth.—The reasonable, the absolute, the immortal, the invisible.</p>
<p>Eran.—And what of the body?</p>
<p>Orth.—The complex, the visible, the mortal.</p>
<p>Eran.—And we say that man is composed of these?</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then we define1256 man as a mortal reasonable being.</p>
<p>Orth.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Eran.—And we give names to him from both these attributes.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes.</p>
<p>Eran.—As then in this case we make no distinction, but call the same man both reasonable
and mortal, so also should we do in the case of the Christ, and apply to Him both the
divine and the human.</p>
<p>Orth.—This is our argument, although you do not accurately express it. For look you.
When we are pursuing the argument about the human soul, do we only mention what is
appropriate to its energy and nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—This only.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when our discussion is about the body, do we not only recall what is appropriate
to it?</p>
<p>Eran.—Quite so.</p>
<p>Orth.—But, when our discourse touches the whole being, then we have no difficulty in
adducing both sets of qualities, for the properties both of the body and of the soul are applicable
to man.</p>
<p>Eran.—Unquestionably.</p>
<p>Orth.—Well; just in this way should we speak of the Christ, and, when arguing about
His natures, give to each its own, and recognise some as belonging to the Godhead, and
some as to the manhood. But when we are discussing the Person we must then make what
is proper to the natures common, and apply both sets of qualities to the Saviour, and call
the same Being both God and Man, both Son of God and Son of Man—both David’s Son
and David’s Lord, both Seed of Abraham and Creator of Abraham, and so on.</p>
<note type="footnote">ψυχικόν. This “natural body” is a body of death (Rom. vii. 24) and requires to be redeemed (Rom. viii. 23) and
changed into the “house which is from heaven.” (2 Cor. v. 2.) Something of the same confusion attaches to the
common use of the word “soul” to which we find the language of Holy Scripture frequently accommodated. On
the popular language of the dichotomy and the more exact trichotomy of 1 Thess. v. 23 a note of Bp. Ellicott on
that passage may well be consulted.</note>

<p>Eran.—That the person of the Christ is one, and that both the divine and the human
are attributable to Him, you have quite rightly said, and I accept this definition of the Faith;
but your real position, that in discussing the natures we must give to each its own properties,
seems to me to dissolve the union. It is for this reason that I object to accept these and similar
arguments.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet when we were enquiring about soul and body you thought the distinction
of these terms admirable, and forthwith gave it your approbation. Why then do you refuse
to receive the same rule in the case of the Godhead and manhood of the Lord Christ? Do
you go so far as to object to comparing the Godhead and the manhood of the Christ to soul
and body? So, while you grant an unconfounded union to soul and body, do you venture
to say that the Godhead and manhood of the Christ have undergone commixture and confusion?</p>
<p>Eran.—I hold the Godhead of the Christ aye, and His flesh too, to be infinitely higher
in honour than soul and body; but after the union I do assert one nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—But now is it not impious and shocking, while maintaining that a soul united
to a body is in no way subject to confusion, to deny to the Godhead of the Lord of the universe
the power to maintain its own nature unconfounded or to keep within its proper bounds
the humanity which He assumed? Is it not, I say, impious to mix the distinct, and to commingle
the separate? The idea of one nature gives ground for suspicion of this confusion.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am equally anxious to avoid the term confusion, but I shrink from asserting
two natures lest I fall into a dualism of sons.</p>
<p>Orth.—I am equally anxious to escape either horn of the dilemma, both the impious
confusion and the impious distinction; for to me it is alike an unhallowed thought to split
the one Son in two and to gainsay the duality of the natures. But now in truth’s name tell
me. Were one of the faction of Arius or Eunomius to endeavour, while disputing with you,
to belittle the Son, and to describe Him as less than and inferior to the Father, by the help
of all their familiar arguments and citations from the divine Scripture of the text “Father, if
it be possible, let this cup pass from me”1257 and that other, “Now is my soul troubled”1258
and other like passages, how would you dispose of his objections? How could you show that
the Son is in no way diminished in dignity by these expressions and is not of another substance,
but begotten of the substance of the Father?</p>
<p>Eran.—I should say that the divine Scripture uses some terms according to the theology
and some according to the oeconomy, and that it is wrong to apply what belongs to the
oeconomy to what belongs to the theology.1259</p>

<pb n="439"/>
<p>Orth.—But your opponent would retort that even in the Old Testament the divine
Scripture says many things oeconomically, as for instance, “Adam heard the voice of the
Lord God walking,”1260 and “I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it which has come to me; and if not I will know,”1261 and again,
“Now I know that thou fearest God”1262 and the like.</p>
<p>Eran.—I might answer to this that there is a great distinction between the oeconomies.
In the Old Testament there is an oeconomy of words; in the New Testament of deeds.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then your opponent would ask of what deeds?</p>
<p>Eran.—He shall straightway hear of the deeds of the making flesh. For the Son of God
on being made man both in word and deed at one time exhibits the flesh, at another the
Godhead: as of course, in the passage quoted, He shews the weakness of the flesh and of the
soul, the sense namely of fear.</p>
<p>Orth.—But if he were to go on to say, “But he did not take a soul but only a body; for
the Godhead instead of a soul being united to the body performed all the functions of the
soul,” with what arguments could you meet his objections?</p>
<p>Eran.—I could bring proofs from the divine Scripture shewing how God the Word took
not only flesh but also soul.
Orth.—And what proofs of this shall we find in Scripture?</p>
<p>Eran.—Have you not heard the Lord saying “I have power to lay it down, and I have
power to take it again.…I lay it down of myself that I might take it again.”1263 And again,
“Now is my soul troubled.”1264 And again, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
death,”1265 and again David’s words as interpreted by Peter “His soul was not left in hell
neither did His flesh see corruption.”1266 These and similar passages clearly point out that
God the Word assumed not only a body but also a soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have quoted this testimony most appositely and properly, but your opponent
might reply that even before the incarnation God said to the Jews, “Fasting and holy day
and feasts my soul hateth.”1267 Then he might go on to argue that as in the Old Testament
He mentioned a soul, though He had not a soul, so He does in the New.</p>

<p>Eran.—But he shall be told again how the divine Scripture, when speaking of God,
mentions even parts of the body as “Incline thine ear and hear”1268 and “Open thine eyes
and see”1269 and “The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it”1270 and “Thy hands have made
me and fashioned me”1271 and countless other passages.</p>
<p>If then after the incarnation we are forbidden to understand soul to mean soul, it is
equally forbidden to hold body to mean body. Thus the great mystery of the oeconomy will
be found to be mere imagination; and we shall in no way differ from Marcion, Valentinus
and Manes, the inventors of all these figments.</p>
<p>Orth.—But if a follower of Apollinarius were suddenly to intervene in our discussion
and were to ask “Most excellent Sir; what kind of soul do you say that Christ assumed?”
what would you answer?</p>
<p>Eran.—I should first of all say that I know only one soul of man; then I should answer,
“But if you reckon two souls, the one reasonable and the other without reason, I say that
the soul assumed was the reasonable. Yours it seems is the unreasonable, inasmuch as you
think that our salvation was incomplete.”</p>
<p>Orth.—But suppose he were to ask for proof of what you say?</p>
<p>Eran.—I could very easily give it. I shall quote the oracles of the Evangelists “The Child
Jesus grew and waxed strong in spirit and the grace of God was upon him”1272 and again
“Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favour with God and men.”1273 I should
say that these have nothing to do with Godhead for the body increased in stature, and in
wisdom the soul—not that which is without reason, but the reasonable. God the Word then
took on Him a reasonable soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—Good Sir, you have bravely broken through the three fold phalanx of your foes;
but that union, and the famous commixture and confusion, not in two ways only but in
three, you have scattered and undone; and not only have you pointed out the distinction
between Godhead and manhood, but you have in two ways distinguished the manhood by
pointing out that the soul is one thing and the body another, so that no longer two, according
to our argument, but three natures of our Saviour Jesus Christ may be understood.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; for did not you say that there is another substance of the soul besides the
nature of the body?</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes.</p>

<p>Eran.—How then does the argument seem absurd to you?</p>
<p>Orth.—Because while you object to two, you have admitted three natures.</p>
<p>Eran.—The contest with our antagonists compels us to this, for how could any one in
any other way argue against those who deny the assumption of the flesh, or of the soul, or
of the mind, but by adducing proofs on these points from the divine Scripture? And how
could any one confute them who in their readiness strive to belittle the Godhead of the only
Begotten but by pointing out that the divine Scripture speaks sometimes theologically and
sometimes oeconomically.</p>
<p>Orth.—What you now say is true. It is what I, nay what all say, who keep whole the
apostolic rule. You yourself have become a supporter of our doctrines.</p>
<p>Eran.—How do I support yours, while I refuse to acknowledge two sons?</p>
<p>Orth.—When did you ever hear of our affirming two sons?</p>
<p>Eran.—He who asserts two natures asserts two sons.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then you assert three sons, for you have spoken of three natures.</p>
<p>Eran.—In no other way was it possible to meet the argument of my opponents.</p>
<p>Orth.—Hear this same thing from us too; for both you and I confront the same antagonists.</p>
<p>Eran.—But I do not assert two natures after the union.</p>
<p>Orth.—And yet after many generations of the union a moment ago you used the same
words. Explain to us however in what sense you assert one nature after the union. Do you
mean one nature derived from both or that one nature remains after the destruction of the
other?</p>
<p>Eran.—I maintain that the Godhead remains and that the manhood was swallowed up
by it.1274</p>
<p>Orth.—Fables of the Gentiles, all this, and follies of the Manichees. I am ashamed so
much as to mention such things. The Greeks had their gods’ swallowings1275 and the
Manichees wrote of the daughter of light. But we reject such teaching as being as absurd as
it is impious, for how could a nature absolute and uncompounded, comprehending the
universe, unapproachable and infinite, have absorbed the nature which it assumed?</p>
<p>Eran.—Like the sea receiving a drop of honey, for straightway the drop, as it mingles
with the ocean’s water, disappears.</p>
<p>Orth.—The sea and the drop are different in quantity, though alike in quality; the one
is greatest, the other is least; the one is sweet and the other is bitter; but in all other respects
you will find a very close relationship. The nature of both is moist, liquid, and fluid. Both

are created. Both are lifeless yet each alike is called a body. There is nothing then absurd in
these cognate natures undergoing commixture, and in the one being made to disappear by
the other. In the case before us on the contrary the difference is infinite, and so great that
no figure of the reality can be found. I will however endeavour to point out to you several
instances of substances which are mixed without being confounded, and remain unimpaired.</p>
<p>Eran.—Who in the world ever heard of an unmixed mixture?</p>
<p>Orth.—I shall endeavour to make you admit this.</p>
<p>Eran.—Should what you are about to advance prove true we will not oppose the truth.</p>
<p>Orth.—Answer then, dissenting or assenting as the argument may seem good to you.</p>
<p>Eran.—I will answer.</p>
<p>Orth.—Does the light at its rising seem to you to fill all the atmosphere except where
men shut up in caverns might remain bereft of it?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And does all the light seem to you to be diffused through all the atmosphere?</p>
<p>Eran.—I am with you so far.</p>
<p>Orth.—And is not the mixture diffused through all that is subject to it?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—But, now, this illuminated atmosphere, do we not see it as light and call it light?</p>
<p>Eran.—Quite so.</p>
<p>Orth.—And yet when the light is present we sometimes are aware of moisture and
aridity; frequently of heat and cold.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And after the departure of the light the atmosphere afterwards remains alone
by itself.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Consider this example too. When iron is brought in contact with fire it is fired.</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the fire is diffused through its whole substance?</p>
<p>Eran.—Well?</p>
<p>Orth.—How, then, does not the complete union, and the mixture universally diffused,
change the iron’s nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—But it changes it altogether. It is now reckoned no longer as iron, but as fire,
and indeed it has the active properties of fire.</p>
<p>Orth.—But does not the smith call it iron, and put it on the anvil and smite it with his
hammer?</p>
<p>Eran.—Unquestionably.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then the nature of the iron was not damaged by contact with the fire. If then,
in natural bodies, instances may be found of an unconfounded mixture, it is sheer folly in

<pb n="443"/>
the case of the nature which knows neither corruption nor change to entertain the idea of
confusion and destruction of the assumed nature, and all the more so when this nature was
assumed to bring blessing on the race.
Eran.—What I assert is not the destruction of the assumed nature, but its change into
the substance of Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then the human race is no longer limited as heretofore?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—When did it undergo this change?</p>
<p>Eran.—After the complete union.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what date do you assign to this?</p>
<p>Eran.—I have said again and again, that of the conception.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet after the conception He was an unborn babe in the womb; after His birth.
He was a babe1276 and was called a babe, and was worshipped by shepherds, and in like
manner became a boy, and was so called by the angel.1277 Do you acknowledge all this? or
do you think I am inventing fables?</p>
<p>Eran.—This is taught in the history of the divine gospels, and cannot be gainsaid.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now let us investigate what follows. We acknowledge, do we not, that the Lord
was circumcised?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—Of what was there a circumcision? Of flesh or Godhead?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of the flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—Of what was then the growth and increase in wisdom and stature?</p>
<p>Eran.—This, of course, is not applicable to Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor hunger and thirst?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor walking about, and being weary, and falling asleep?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then the union took place at the conception, and all these things came to pass
after the conception and the birth, then, after the union, the manhood did not lose its own
nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—I have not stated my meaning exactly. It was after the resurrection from the
dead that the flesh underwent the change into Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then, after the resurrection, nothing of all that indicates its nature remained in
it?</p>
<p>Eran.—If it remained, the divine change did not take place.</p>

<pb n="444"/>
<p>Orth.—How then was it that He shewed His hands and His feet to the disciples who
disbelieved?</p>
<p>Eran.—Just as He came in when the doors were shut.</p>
<p>Orth.—But He came in when the doors were shut just as He came out from the womb,
though the virgin’s bolts and bars were undrawn, and just as He walked upon the sea. Then
according to your argument not even yet had the change of nature taken place?</p>
<p>Eran.—The Lord shewed His hands to the Apostles in the same way as He wrestled with
Jacob.</p>
<p>Orth.—No; the Lord does not allow us to understand it in this sense. The disciples
thought they saw a spirit, but the Lord dispelled this idea, and shewed the nature of the flesh,
for He said “Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my
hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me have.”1278 And observe the exactness of the language. He does not say
“is not flesh and bones,” but “has not flesh and bones,” in order to point out that the nature
of the possessor and the nature of that which is possessed are distinct and separate. Just in
the same way that which took and that which was taken are separate and distinct, and the
Christ is beheld made one of both. Thus the part possessing is entirely different from the
part possessed; and yet does not divide into two persons Him who is an object of thought
in them. The Lord, indeed, while the disciples were still in doubt, asked for food and took
and ate it, not consuming the food only in appearance, nor satisfying to the need of the
body.</p>
<p>Eran.—But one of these alternatives must be accepted; either He partook because He
needed, or else, needing not, He seemed to eat, and did not really partake of food.</p>
<p>Orth.—His body now become immortal required no food. Of them that rise the Lord
says: “they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as Angels.”1279 The apostles
however bear witness that He partook of the food, for the blessed Luke in the preface to the
Acts says “being assembled together with the apostles the Lord commanded them that they
should not depart from Jerusalem”1280 and the very divine Peter says more distinctly: “Who
did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead.”1281 For since eating is proper to
them that live this present life, of necessity the Lord by means of eating and drinking proved
the resurrection of the flesh to them that did not acknowledge it to be real. This same course
He pursued in the case of Lazarus and of Jairus’ daughter. For when He had raised up the

<pb n="445"/>
latter He ordered that something should be given her to eat1282 and He made Lazarus sit
with Him at the table1283 and so shewed the reality of the rising again.</p>
<p>Eran.—If we grant that the Lord really ate, let us grant that after the resurrection all
men partake of food.</p>
<p>Orth.—What was done by the Saviour through a certain oeconomy is not a rule and law
of nature. This follows from the fact that He did other things by oeconomy which shall by
no means be the lot of them that live again.</p>
<p>Eran.—What do you mean?</p>
<p>Orth.—Will not the bodies of them that rise become incorruptible and immortal?</p>
<p>Eran.—So the divine Paul has taught us. “It is sown” he says “in corruption; it is raised
in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power; it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.”1284</p>
<p>Orth.—But the Lord, who raises the bodies of all men, unmaimed and unmarred (for
lameness of limb and blindness of eye are unknown among them that are risen),1285 left in
His own body the prints of the nails, and the wound in His side, whereof are witnesses both
the Lord Himself and the hand of Thomas.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then after the resurrection the Lord both partook of food, and shewed His
hands and His feet to His disciples, and in them the prints of the nails, and His side with
the mark of the wound in it, and said to them, “Handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh
and bones as ye see me have”1286 it follows that after His resurrection the nature of His
body was preserved and was not changed into another substance.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then after the resurrection it is mortal and subject to suffering?</p>
<p>Orth.—By no means; it is incorruptible, impassible, and immortal.</p>
<p>Eran.—If it is incorruptible, impassible, and immortal, it has been changed into another
nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the bodies of all men will be changed into another substance, for all
will be incorruptible and immortal. Or have you not heard the words of the Apostle, “For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality”?1287</p>

<p>Eran.—I have heard.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the nature remains, but its corruption is changed into incorruption,
and its mortal into immortality. But let us look at the matter in this way; we call a body that
is sick and a body that is whole, in the same way, a body.</p>
<p>Eran.—Unquestionably.</p>
<p>Orth.—Wherefore?</p>
<p>Eran.—Since both partake of the same substance.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet we see in them a very great difference, for the one is whole, perfect, and
unhurt; the other has either lost an eye, or has a broken leg, or has undergone some other
suffering.</p>
<p>Eran.—But to the same nature belong both health and sickness.</p>
<p>Orth.—So the body is called substance; disease and health are called accident.</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course. For these things are accidents of the body, and again cease to be so.</p>
<p>Orth.—In the same way corruption and death must be called accidents, and not substances,
for they too are accidents and cease to be so.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—So the body of the Lord rose incorruptible, impassible, and immortal, and is
worshipped by the powers of heaven, and is yet a body having its former limitation.</p>
<p>Eran.—In these points you seem to say sooth, but after its assumption into heaven I do
not think that you will deny that it was changed into the nature of Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—I would not so say persuaded only by human arguments, for I am not so rash
as to say anything concerning which divine Scripture is silent. But I have heard the divine
Paul exclaiming “God hath appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness
by that man whom He hath ordained whereof He hath given assurance unto all
men in that He hath raised Him from the dead,”1288 and I have learnt from the holy Angels
that He will come in like manner as the disciples saw Him going into heaven.1289 Now they
saw His nature not unlimited. For I have heard the words of the Lord, “Ye shall see the Son
of Man coming in the clouds of heaven,”1290 and I acknowledge that what is seen of men
is limited, for the unlimited nature is invisible. Furthermore to sit upon a throne of glory
and to set the lambs upon the right and the kids upon the left1291 indicates limitation.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then He was not unlimited even before the incarnation, for the prophet saw
Him surrounded by the Seraphim.1292</p>

<pb n="447"/>
<p>Orth.—The prophet did not see the substance of God, but a certain appearance accommodated
to his capacity. After the resurrection, however, all the world will see the very visible
nature of the judge.</p>
<p>Eran.—You promised that you would adduce no argument without evidence, but you
are introducing arguments adapted to us.</p>
<p>Orth.—I have learnt these things from the divine Scripture. I have heard the words of
the prophet Zechariah “They shall look on Him whom they pierced,”1293 and how shall the
event follow the prophecy unless the crucifiers recognise the nature which they crucified?
And I have heard the cry of the victorious martyr Stephen, “Behold I see the heavens opened
and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God,”1294 and he saw the visible, not the
invisible nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—These things are thus written, but I do not think that you will be able to show
that the body, after the ascension into heaven, is called body by the inspired writers.</p>
<p>Orth.—What has been already said indicates the body perfectly plainly; for what is seen
is a body; but I will nevertheless point out to you that even after the assumption the body
of the Lord is called a body. Hear the teaching of the Apostle, “For our conversation is in
Heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall change our vile
body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.”1295 It was not changed into another
nature, but remained a body, full however of divine glory, and sending forth beams
of light. The bodies of the saints shall be fashioned like unto it. But if it was changed into
another nature, their bodies will be likewise changed, for they shall be fashioned like unto
it. But if the bodies of the saints preserve the character of their nature, then also the body
of the Lord in like manner keeps its own nature unchanged.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then will the bodies of the saints be equal with the body of the Lord?</p>
<p>Orth.—In its incorruption and its immortality they too will share. Moreover in its glory
they will participate, as says the Apostle, “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be
also glorified together.”1296 It is in quantity that the vast difference may be found, a difference
as great as between sun and stars, or rather between master and slaves, and that which gives
and that which receives light. Yet has He given a share of His own name to His servants and
as He is Light, calls His saints light, for “Ye,” He says, “are the Light of the world,”1297 and
being named servants and being named “Sun of Righteousness”1298 He says of his servants

“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun.”1299 It is therefore according to quality,
not according to quantity, that the bodies of the saints shall be fashioned like unto the body
of the Lord. Now I have shewn you plainly what you bade me. Further, if you please, let us
look at the matter in yet another way.</p>
<p>Eran.—One ought “to stir every stone,” as the proverb says,1300 to get at the truth; above
all when it is a question of divine doctrines.</p>
<p>Orth.—Tell me now; the mystic symbols which are offered to God by them who perform
priestly rites, of what are they symbols?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>Orth.—Of the real body or not?</p>
<p>Eran.—The real.</p>
<p>Orth.—Good. For there must be the archetype of the image. So painters imitate nature
and paint the images of visible objects.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—If, then, the divine mysteries are antitypes of the real body,1301 therefore even
now the body of the Lord is a body, not changed into nature of Godhead, but filled with
divine glory.</p>
<p>Eran.—You have opportunely introduced the subject of the divine mysteries for from
it I shall be able to show you the change of the Lord’s body into another nature. Answer
now to my questions.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will answer.</p>
<p>Eran.—What do you call the gift which is offered before the priestly invocation?</p>
<p>Orth.—It were wrong to say openly; perhaps some uninitiated are present.</p>
<p>Eran.—Let your answer be put enigmatically.</p>
<p>Orth.—Food of grain of such a sort.</p>
<p>Eran.—And how name we the other symbol?</p>
<p>Orth.—This name too is common, signifying species of drink.</p>
<p>Eran.—And after the consecration how do you name these?</p>
<p>Orth.—Christ’s body and Christ’s blood.</p>
<p>Eran.—And do you believe that you partake of Christ’s body and blood?</p>
<p>Orth.—I do.</p>

<pb n="449"/>
<p>Eran.—As, then, the symbols of the Lord’s body and blood are one thing before the
priestly invocation, and after the invocation are changed and become another thing; so the
Lord’s body after the assumption is changed into the divine substance.</p>
<p>Orth.—You are caught in the net you have woven yourself. For even after the consecra-
tion the mystic symbols are not deprived of their own nature; they remain in their former
substance figure and form; they are visible and tangible as they were before. But they are
regarded as what they are become, and believed so to be, and are worshipped1302 as being
what they are believed to be. Compare then the image with the archetype, and you will see
the likeness, for the type must be like the reality. For that body preserves its former form,
figure, and limitation and in a word the substance of the body; but after the resurrection it
has become immortal and superior to corruption; it has become worthy of a seat on the
right hand; it is adored by every creature as being called the natural body of the Lord.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; and the mystic symbol changes its former appellation; it is no longer called
by the name it went by before, but is styled body. So must the reality be called God, and not
body.</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem to me to be ignorant—for He is called not only body but even bread
of life. So the Lord Himself used this name1303 and that very body we call divine body, and
giver of life, and of the Master and of the Lord, teaching that it is not common to every man
but belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ Who is God and Man. “For Jesus Christ” is “the same
yesterday, to-day, and forever.”1304</p>
<p>Eran.—You have said a great deal about this, but I follow the saints who have shone of
old in the Church; show me then, if you can, these in their writings dividing the natures
after the union.</p>
<p>Orth.—I will read you their works, and I am sure you will be astonished at the countless
mentions of the distinction which in their struggle against impious heretics they have inserted
in their writings. Hear now those whose testimony I have already adduced speaking openly
and distinctly on these points.</p>

From the third Book of his work “Against Heresies.” (Chap. XX.)</p>
<p>“As we have said before, He united man to God. For had not a man vanquished man’s
adversary, the enemy would not have been vanquished aright; and again, had not God
granted the boon of salvation we should not have possessed it in security. And had not man
been united to God, he could not have shared in the incorruption. For it behoved the mediator
of God and men, by means of His close kinship to either, to bring them both into
friendship and unanimity, and to set man close to God and to make God known to men.”</p>

<p>“So again in his Epistle he says ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of
God,’1307 recognising one and the same Jesus Christ to whom the gates of heaven were

suffered shall come revealing the glory of the Father.”</p>

Christ in the flesh and the apostles) were abandoned and removed. And now they are no

may be quoting a verbal tradition. Bp. Lightfoot further points out that Origen (l. c.) supposes the author

<p>“They who preach that Emmanuel was of the Virgin set forth the union of God the
Word with His creature.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same treatise (Book V. Chap. I.):—</p>
<p>“Now these things came to pass not in seeming but in essential truth, for if He appeared
to be man though He was not man then the Spirit of God did not continue to be what in
truth It is; for the Spirit is invisible; nor was there any truth in Him, for He was not what
He appeared to be. And we have said before that Abraham and the rest of the prophets beheld
Him in prophecy prophesying what was destined to come to pass in actual sight. If then
now too He appeared to be of such a character, though in reality He was not what He appeared,
then a kind of prophetic vision would have been given to men, and we must still
look for yet another advent in which He will really be what He is now seen to be in prophecy.
Now we have demonstrated that there is no difference between the statements that He only
appeared in seeming and that He took nothing from Mary, for He did not really even possess
flesh and blood whereby He redeemed us, unless He renewed in Himself the old creation
of Adam. The sect of Valentinus are therefore vain in teaching thus that they may cast out
the life of the flesh.”</p>
<p>Testimony of the holy Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, from his work on the distribution
of the talents:1310—</p>
<p>“Any one might say that these and those who uphold otherwise are neighbours, erring
as they do in the same manner, for even they either confess that the Christ appeared in life
as mere man, denying the talent of His Godhead, or else acknowledging Him as God, on
the other hand they deny the man, representing that He deluded the sight of them that beheld
Him by unreal appearances; and that He wore manhood not as a Man but was rather a mere
imaginary semblance, as Marcion and Valentinus and the Gnostics teach, wrenching away
the Word from the flesh, and rejecting the one talent, the incarnation.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his letter to a certain Queen:1311—</p>
<p>“He calls Him ‘the first fruits of them that sleep,’ as being ‘the first born from the
dead,’1312 and He, after His resurrection, wishing to show that that which was risen was the
same as that which had undergone death, when the disciples were doubting, called Thomas
to Him, and said, ‘Come hither handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and blood as
ye see me have.’”1313</p>

held fast in bonds of death; He who came down from above and lifted up him that was down;
He who became Evangelist of the dead, ransomer of souls and resurrection of them that

man firstborn Word; visiting the first formed Adam in the Virgin; the spiritual seeking the
earthy in the womb; the ever-living him who by disobedience died; the heavenly calling the
earthly to the world above, the highborn meaning to make the slave free by His own obedience;

soldiers, nailed to a cross by Jews, He commends His spirit to the Father with a cry, He leans
His head as He breathes His last, He is pierced in the side with a spear and rolled in fine

on the same throne as the divine Spirit on account of the God that dwells in Him continually.”</p>

like are generated of like, offspring appear as very images of their parents, but the manhood
which He wore is an image of the Son, as images even of different colours are painted on

with all the rest, and clad in similar form.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“That he speaks of the body as conformed to those of men he teaches more clearly in
his Epistle to the Philippians, ‘our conversation’ he says ‘is in Heaven from whence also we
look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be
fashioned like unto His glorious body.’1322 And if by changing the form of the vile body of
men He fashions it like unto His own body, then the false teaching of our opponents is
shewn to be in every way worthless.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“But as being born of the Virgin He is said to have been made man of the woman,1323
so He is described as being made under the law because of His sometimes walking by the
precepts of the law, as for instance when His parents zealously urged His circumcision,
when He was a child eight days old, as relates the evangelist Luke, afterwards ‘they brought
Him to present Him to the Lord,’ ‘bringing the offerings of purification’ ‘to offer a sacrifice
according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young
pigeons.’1324 As then the gifts of purification were offered on His behalf according to the
law, and He underwent circumcision on the eighth day, the Apostle very properly writes
that He was thus brought under the law. Not indeed that the Word was subject to the law,
(as our calumnious opponents suppose) being Himself the law, nor did God, who by one
breath can cleanse and hallow all things, need sacrifices of purification. But He took from
the Virgin the members of a man and became subject to the law and was purified according
to the rite of the firstborn, not because He submitted to this treatment from any need on
His part of such observance, but in order that He might redeem from the slavery of the law
them that were sold to the doom of the curse.”</p>

<p>From his Second Discourse against heresies:1325—</p>
<p>“We should not have been redeemed from sin and the curse had not the flesh which
the Word wore been by nature that of man, for we should have had nothing in common
with that which was not our own; just so man would not have been made God, had not the
Word which was made flesh been by nature of the Father and verily and properly His. And

the combination is of this character that to the natural God may be joined the natural man,
and so his salvation and deification be secure. Therefore let them that deny Him to be naturally
of the Father, and own Son of His substance, deny too that He took very flesh of man
from the Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his Epistle to Epictetus:—</p>
<p>“If on account of the Saviour’s Body being, and being described in the Scriptures as
being, derived from Mary, and a human Body, they fancy that a quaternity is substituted
for a Trinity, as though some addition were made by the body, they are quite wrong; they
put the creature on a par with the Creator, and suppose that the Godhead is capable of being
added to. They fail to see that the Word was not made flesh on account of any addition to
Godhead, but that the flesh may rise. Not for the aggrandisement of the Word did He come
forth from Mary, but that the human race may be redeemed. How can they think that the
body ransomed and quickened by the Word can add anything in the way of Godhead to the
Word that quickened it?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same Epistle:—</p>
<p>“Let them be told that if the Word had been a creature, the creature would not have
assumed a body to quicken it. For what help can creatures get from a creature standing itself
in need of salvation? But the Word, Himself Creator, was made maker of created things,
and therefore in the fulness of the ages He attached the creature to Himself, that once more
as a Creator He might renew it, and might be able to create it afresh.”</p>
<p>From the longer Discourse “De Fide”:—</p>
<p>“This also we add concerning the words ‘Sit thou on my right hand,’1326 that they are
said of the Lord’s body. For if ‘the Lord saith, do not I fill heaven and earth,’1327 as says
Jeremiah, and God contains all things, and is contained of none, on what kind of throne
does He sit? It is therefore the body to which He says ‘Sit thou on my right hand,’ of which
too the devil with his wicked powers was foe, and Jews and Gentiles too. Through this body
too He was made and was called High Priest and Apostle through the mystery whereof He
gave to us, saying ‘This is my Body for you’1328 and ‘my Blood of the New Testament’ (not
of the Old), shed for you.”1329 Now Godhead hath neither body nor blood; but the manhood
which He bore of Mary was the cause of them, of whom the Apostles said ‘Jesus of Nazareth,
a man approved of God among you.’”1330</p>

which is above every name’1331 he speaks of the temple of the body, not of the Godhead,
for the Most High is not exalted, but the flesh of the Most High is exalted, and to the flesh
of the Most High He gave a name which is above every name. Nor did the Word of God
receive the designation of God as a favour, but His flesh was held divine as well as Himself.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“And when he says ‘the Holy Ghost was not yet because that Jesus was not yet glorified,’
1332 he says that His flesh was not yet glorified, for the Lord of glory is not glorified,
but the flesh itself receives glory of the glory of the Lord as it mounts with Him into Heaven;
whence he says the spirit of adoption was not yet among men, because the first fruits taken
from men had not yet ascended into heaven. Wherever then the Scripture says that the Son
received and was glorified, it speaks because of His manhood, not His Godhead.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>

mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ united to the Father in spirit, and to us in flesh, who

<p>Testimony of the Holy Ambrosius, bishop of Milan.
In his Exposition of the Faith:—</p>
<p>“We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, was begotten
before all ages, without beginning, of the Father, and that in these last days the same was
made flesh of the holy Virgin Mary, assumed the manhood, in its perfection, of a reasonable
soul and body, of one substance with the Father as touching His Godhead and of one substance
with us as touching His manhood. For union of two perfect natures hath been after
an ineffable manner. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ;
knowing that being coeternal with His own Father as touching His Godhead, by virtue of
which also He is creator of all, He deigned, after the assent of the Holy Virgin, when she
said to the angel ‘Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word’1333
to build after an ineffable fashion a temple out of her for Himself, and to unite this temple
to Himself by her conception, not taking and uniting with Himself a body coeternal with
His own substance, and brought from heaven, but of the matter of our substance, that is of
the Virgin. God the Word was not turned into flesh; His appearance was not unreal; keeping
ever His own substance immutably and invariably He took the first fruits of our nature, and
united them to Himself. God the Word did not take His beginning from the Virgin, but
being coeternal with His own Father He of infinite kindness deigned to unite to Himself

the first fruits of our nature, undergoing no mixture but in either substance appearing one
and the same, as it is written ‘Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.’1334
For the divine Christ, as touching my substance which he took is destroyed, and the same
Christ raises the destroyed temple as touching the divine substance in which also He is
Creator of all things. Never at any time after the Union which He deigned to make with
Himself from the moment of the conception did He depart from His own temple, nor indeed
through His ineffable love for mankind could depart.</p>
<p>“The same Christ is both passible and impassible; as touching His manhood passible
and as touching His Godhead impassible. ‘Behold behold me, it is I, I have undergone no
change’—and when God the Word had raised His own temple and in it had wrought out
the resurrection and renewal of our nature, He shewed this nature to His disciples and said
‘Handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me,’ not ‘be’ but ‘have.’1335
So He says, referring to both the possessor and the possessed in order that you may perceive
that what had taken place was not mixture, not change, not variation, but union. On this
account too He shewed the prints of the nails and the wound of the spear and ate before
His disciples to convince them by every means that the resurrection of our nature had been
renewed in Him; and further because in accordance with the blessed substance of His
Godhead unchanged, impassible, immortal, He lived in need of nought, He by concession
permitted all that can be felt to be brought to His own temple, and by His own power raised
it up, and by means of His own temple made perfect the renewal of our nature.</p>
<p>“Them therefore that assert that the Christ was mere man, that God the Word was
passible, or changed into flesh, or that the body which He had was consubstantial, or that
He brought it from Heaven, or that it was an unreality; or assert that God the Word being
mortal needed to receive His resurrection from the Father, or that the body which He assumed
was without a soul, or manhood without a mind, or that the two natures of the Christ
became one nature by confusion and commixture; them that deny that our Lord Jesus Christ
was two natures unconfounded, but one person, as He is one Christ and one Son, all these
the catholic and apostolic Church condemns.”</p>
<p>Of the same:1336—</p>
<p>“If then the flesh of all was in Christ or hath been in Christ subject to wrongs, how can
it be held to be of one essence with the Godhead? For if the Word and the flesh which derives
its nature from earth are of one essence, then the Word and the soul which He took in its
perfection are of one essence, for the Word is of one nature with God both according to the
Word of the Father, and the confession of the Son Himself in the words, ‘I and my Father

are one.’1337 Thus the Father must be held to be of the same substance with the body. Why
any longer are ye wroth with the Arians, who say that the Son is a creature of God, while
you assert yourselves that the Father is of one substance with His creatures?”</p>
<p>Of the same from his letter to the Emperor Gratianus:1338—</p>
<p>“Let us preserve a distinction between Godhead and flesh. One Son of God speaks in
both, since in Him both natures exist. The same Christ speaks, yet not always in the same
but sometimes in a different manner. Observe how at one time He expresses divine glory
and at another human feeling. As God He utters the things of God, since He is the Word;
as man He speaks with humility because He converses in my essence.”</p>
<p>On the same from the same book:1339—</p>
<p>“As to the passage where we read that the Lord of glory was crucified,1340 let us not
suppose that He was crucified in His own glory. But since He is both God and man, as
touching His Godhead God, and as touching the assumption of the flesh, a man, Jesus Christ,
the Lord of Glory, is said to have been crucified. For He partakes of either nature—that is
the human and the divine. In the nature of manhood He underwent the passion in order
that He who suffered might be said to be without distinction both Lord of Glory and Son
of Man. As it is written ‘He that came down from Heaven.’”1341</p>
<p>Similarly of the same:1342—</p>
<p>“Let then vain questions about words be silent, as it is written, the kingdom of God is
not in ‘enticing words’ but in ‘demonstration of the spirit.’1343 For there is one Son of God
who speaks in both ways, since both natures exist in Him; but although He Himself speaks
He does not speak always in the same way; for you see in Him at one time God’s glory, at
another time man’s feeling. As God He utters divine things, being the Word; as man He
utters human things, since in this nature He spoke.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his work on the Incarnation of the Lord against the Apollinarians:
1344—</p>
<p>“But while we are confuting these, another set spring up who assert the body of the
Christ and His godhead to be of one nature. What hell hath vomited forth so terrible a
blasphemy? Really Arians are more tolerable, whose infidelity, on account of these men, is

strengthened, so that with greater opposition they deny Father, Son and Holy Ghost to be
of one substance, for they did at least endeavour to maintain the Godhead of the Lord and
His flesh to be of one nature.”</p>
<p>Of the same (from the same chapter):—</p>
<p>“He has frequently told me that he maintains the exposition of the Nicene Council, but
in that examination our Fathers laid down that the Word of God, not the flesh, was of one
substance with the Father, and they confessed that the Word came from the substance of
the Father but that the flesh is of the Virgin. Why then do they hold out to us the name of
the Nicene Council, while in reality they are introducing innovations of which our forefathers
never entertained the thought?”</p>
<p>Of the same against Apollinarius:1345—</p>
<p>“Refuse thou to allow that the body is by nature on a par with the Godhead. Even though
thou believe the body of the Christ to be real and bring it to the altar for transformation,1346
and fail to distinguish the nature of the body and of the Godhead we shall say to thee, ‘If
thou offer rightly and fail to distinguish rightly, thou sinnest; hold thy peace.’1347 Distinguish
what belongs naturally to us, and what is peculiar to the Word. For I had not what was
naturally His, and He had not what was naturally mine, but He took what was naturally
mine in order to make us partakers of what was His. And He received this not for confusion
but for completion.”</p>
<p>Of the same, a little further on:1348—</p>
<p>“Let them who say that the nature of the Word has been changed into nature of the
body say so no more, lest by the same interpretation the nature of the Word seem to have
been changed into the corruption of sin. For there is a distinction between what took, and
what was taken. Power came over the Virgin, as in the words of the angel to her, ‘The power
of the highest shall overshadow thee.’1349 But what was born was of the body of the Virgin,

be insensible to pain. As then the Lord suffered hunger after solid food had been digested,
and thirst when the moisture in His body was exhausted; and was aweary when His nerves
and sinews were strained by His journeying, it was not that His divinity was weighed down
with toil, but that His body showed the wonted symptoms of its nature. Thus too when He

<p>“God and man are two natures, as soul and body are two; but there are not two sons,
nor yet are there here two men although Paul thus speaks of the outward man and the inward
man.1355 In a word the sources of the Saviour’s being are of two kinds, since the visible is
distinct from the invisible and the timeless from that which is of time, but He is not two
beings. God forbid.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same Exposition to Cledonius:—</p>
<p>“If any one says that the flesh has now been laid aside, and that the Godhead is bare of
body, and that it is not and will not come with that which was assumed, let him be deprived
of the vision of the glory of the advent! For where is the body now, save with Him that assumed
it? For it assuredly has not been, as the Manichees fable, swallowed up by the Son,
that it may be honoured through dishonour; it has not been poured out and dissolved in
the air like a voice and stream of perfume or flash of unsubstantial lightning. And where is
the capacity of being handled after the resurrection, wherein one day it shall be seen by them
that pierced Him? For Godhead of itself is invisible.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the second discourse about the Son:—</p>
<p>“As the Word He was neither obedient nor disobedient, for these qualities belong to
them that are in subjection and to inferiors; the former of the more tractable and the latter
of them that deserve condemnation. But in the form of a servant He accommodates Himself
to his fellowservants and puts on a form that was not His own, bearing in Himself all of me
with all that is mine, that in Himself He may waste and destroy the baser parts as wax is
wasted by fire or the mist of the earth by the sun.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse on the Theophany:—</p>
<p>“Since He came forth from the Virgin with the assumption of two things mutually opposed
to one another, flesh and spirit, whereof the one was taken into God and the other
exhibited the grace of the Godhead.”</p>
<p>Of the same a little further on:—</p>
<p>“He was sent, but as Man. For His nature was twofold, for without doubt He thenceforth
was aweary and hungered and thirsted and suffered agony and shed tears after the custom
of a human body.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his second discourse about the Son:—</p>
<p>“He would be called God not of the Word, but of the visible creation, for how could He
be God of Him that is absolutely God? Just so He is called Father, not of the visible creation,
but of the Word. For He was of two-fold nature. Wherefore the one belongs absolutely to
<note type="footnote">1355 2 Cor. iv. 16</note>

<pb n="462"/>
both, but the other not absolutely.1356 For He is absolutely our God, but not absolutely our
Father. And it is this conjunction of names which gives rise to the error of heretics. A proof
of this lies in the fact that when natures are distinguished in thought, there is a distinction
in names. Listen to the words of Paul. ‘The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, The Father of
Glory,’1357—of Christ He is God, of glory Father, and if both are one this is so not by nature
but by conjunction. What can be plainer than this? Fifthly let it be said that He receives life,
authority, inheritance of nations, power over all flesh, glory, disciples or what you will; all
these belong to the manhood.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“‘For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus.’
1358 As man He still pleads for my salvation, because He keeps with Him the body which
He took, till he made me God by the power of the incarnation—though He be no longer
known according to the flesh that is by affections of the flesh and though He be without
sin.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Is it not plain to all that as God He knows, and is ignorant, He says, as man? If, that is,
any one distinguish the apparent from that which is an object of intellectual perception. For
what gives rise to this opinion is the fact that the appellation of the Son is absolute without
relation, it not being added of whom He is the Son; so to give the most pious sense to this
ignorance we hold it to belong to the human, and not to the divine.”</p>
<p>Testimony of the Holy Gregorius, bishop of Nyssa.</p>

of the flesh, as by some vessel?”</p>

<p>“But if man’s soul by necessity of its nature commingled with the body, is everywhere
in authority, what need is there of asserting that the Godhead is limited by the nature of the
flesh?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>

<p>“The Son of Mary converses with brothers, but the only begotten has no brothers, for
how could the name of only begotten be preserved among brothers? And the same Christ
that said ‘God is a spirit’1359 says to His disciples ‘Handle me,’1360 to shew that the human
nature only can be handled and that the divine is intangible; and He that said ‘I go’1361 indicates
removal from place to place, while He that comprehends all things and ‘by Whom,’
as says the Apostle, ‘all things were created and by Whom all things consist,’1362 had among
all existing things nothing without and beyond Himself which can stand to Him in the relation
of motion or removal.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“‘Being by the right hand of God exalted.’1363 Who then was exalted? The lowly or the
most high? And what is the lowly if it be not the human? And what is the most high save
the divine? But God being most high needs no exaltation, and so the Apostle says that the
human is exalted, exalted that is in being ‘made both Lord and Christ.’1364 Therefore the
Apostle does not mean by this term ‘He made’ the everlasting existence of the Lord, but the
change of the lowly to the exalted which took place on the right hand of God. By this word
he declares the mystery of piety, for when he says ‘by the right hand of God exalted’ he
plainly reveals the ineffable oeconomy of the mystery that the right hand of God which created
all things, which is the Lord by whom all things were made and without whom nothing
consists of things that were made,1365 through the union lifted up to Its own exaltation the
manhood united to It.”</p>

midst of them. Never at any time before the passion did He do this. Could not then the
Christ have done this even long before? For all things are possible to God.1368 But before
the passion He did not do so lest you should suppose the incarnation an unreality or appearance,
and think of the flesh of the Christ as spiritual, or that it came down from heaven and
is of another substance than our flesh. Some have invented all these theories with the idea
that thereby they reverence the Lord, forgetful that through their thanksgiving they blaspheme
themselves, and accuse the truth of a lie: for I say nothing of the lie being altogether absurd.
For if He took another body how does that affect mine, which stands in need of salvation?
If He brought down flesh from heaven, how does this affect my flesh which was derived
from earth?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Wherefore not before the passion, but after the passion, the Lord stood in the midst
of the disciples when the doors were shut, that thou mayest know that thy natural body after
being sown is ‘raised a spiritual body,’1369 and that thou mayest not suppose the body that
is raised to be a different body. When Thomas after the resurrection doubted, He shews
him the prints of the nails, He shews him the marks of the spears. But had He not power to
heal Himself after the resurrection too, when even before the resurrection He had healed
all men? But by shewing the prints of the nails He shews that it is this very body; by coming
in when the doors were shut He shews that it has not the same qualities; the same body to
fulfil the work of the incarnation by raising that which had become a corpse, but a changed
body that it fall not again under corruption nor be subject again to death.”</p>
<p>Testimony of the blessed Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria.</p>
<p>From his work against Origen:—</p>
<p>“Our likeness which He assumed is not changed into the nature of Godhead nor is His
Godhead turned into our likeness. For He remains what He was from the beginning God,
and He so remains preserving our subsistence in Himself.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same treatise:—</p>
<p>“But you persist continually in your blasphemies attacking the Son of God, and using
these words ‘as the Son and the Father are one, so also are the soul which the Son took and
the Son Himself one.’ You are ignorant that the Son and the Father are one on account of
their one substance and the same Godhead; but the soul and the Son are each of a different
substance and different nature. For if the soul of the Son and the Son Himself are one in the
same sense in which the Father and the Son are one, then the Father and the Soul will be
one and the soul of the Son shall one day say ‘He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;’1370

<pb n="465"/>
but this is not so; God forbid. For the Son and the Father are one because there is no distinction
between their qualities, but the soul and the Son are distinguished alike in nature and
substance, in that the soul which is naturally of one substance with us was made by Him.
For if the soul and the Son are one in the same manner in which the Father and the Son are
one, as Origen would have it, then the soul equally with the Son will be ‘the brightness of
God’s glory and express image of His person.’1371 But this is impossible; impossible that
the Son and the soul should be one as He and the Father are one. And what will Origen do
when again he attacks himself? For he writes, never could the soul distressed and ‘exceeding
sorrowful’1372 be the ‘firstborn of every creature.’1373 For God the Word, as being stronger
than the soul, the Son Himself, says ‘I have power to lay it down and I have power to take
it again.’1374 If then the Son is stronger than His own soul, as is agreed, how can His soul
be equal to God and in the form of God? For we say that ‘He emptied Himself and took
upon Him the form of a servant.’1375 In the extravagance of his impieties Origen surpasses
all other heretics, as we have shewn, for if the Word exists in the form of God and is equal
to God and if he supposes thus daring to write the soul of the Saviour to be in the form of
God and equal with God, how can the equal be greater, when the inferior in nature testifies
to the superiority of what is beyond it?”</p>

did He stand here, but taking the first fruits of thy nature He sat down ‘above all principality
and power and might, and every name that is named not only in this world but in the world
to come.’1377 What could be equal to this honour? The first fruits of our race which has so
much offended and is so dishonoured sits so high and enjoys honour so vast.”</p>

from shewing him both wound and print of nails, and letting him lay his hand upon the
scars, and said ‘Examine and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones.’1379 The reason of
His not assuming the manhood of full age from the beginning, and of His deigning to be
conceived, to be born, to be suckled, and to live so long upon the earth, was that by the long
period of the time and all the other circumstances, He might give a warranty for this very
thing.”</p>
<p>Of the same against those who assert that demons rule human affairs:—</p>
<p>“Nothing was more worthless than man and than man nothing has become more precious.
He was the last part of the reasonable creation, but the feet have been made the head,
and through the firstfruits have been borne up to the kingly throne. Just as some man noble
and bountiful, on seeing a wretch escaped from shipwreck who has saved nothing but his
bare body from the waves, welcomes him with open hands, clothes him in a radiant robe,
and exalts him to the highest honour, so too hath God done towards our nature. Man had
lost all that he had, his freedom, his intercourse with God, his abode in Paradise, his painless
life, whence he came forth like a man all naked from a wreck, but God received him and
straightway clothed him, and, taking him by the hand, led him onward step by step and
brought him up to heaven.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>

absurd from the phrase ‘was made.’ For I have not mentioned any change in that unchangeable
nature, but of tabernacling1383 and of inhabiting. Now that which tabernacles is not
identical with the tabernacle, but one thing tabernacles in another; otherwise there would
be no tabernacling. Nothing inhabits itself. I spoke of a distinction of substance. For by the
union and the conjunction God the Word and the flesh are one without confusion or destruction
of the substances, but by ineffable and indescribable union.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the gospel according to St. Matthew:—</p>
<p>“Just as one standing in the space between two that are separated from one another,
stretches out both his hands and joins them, so too did He, joining the old and the new, the
divine nature and the human, His own with ours.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the Ascension of Christ:—</p>
<p>“For so when two champions stand ready for the fight, some other intervening between
them, at once stops the struggle, and puts an end to their ill will, so too did Christ. As God
He was wroth, but we made light of His wrath, and turned away our faces from our loving
Lord. Then Christ flung Himself in the midst, and restored both natures to mutual love,
and Himself took on Him the weight of the punishment laid by the Father on us.”</p>

nay more He seated it on His own right hand, let us then recognise who it was to whom it

thou art and to dust thou shalt return.’”1385</p>
<p>Of the same a little further on:—</p>
<p>“What arguments to use, what words to utter I cannot tell; the nature which was rotten,
worthless, declared lowest of all, vanquished everything and overcame the world. To-day it
hath been thought worthy to be made higher than all, to-day it hath received what from old
time angels have desired; to-day it is possible for archangels to be made spectators of what
has been for ages longed for, and they contemplate our nature, shining on the throne of the
King in the glory of His immortality.”</p>

<p>From the Gospel according to St. Luke:—</p>
<p>“In all of us the Lord writes the express image of His holiness, and in various ways shows
our nature the way of salvation. Many and clear proofs does He give us both of His bodily
advent and of His Godhead working by a body’s means. For He wished to give us assurance
of both His natures.”</p>
<p>Of the same on the Theophany:—</p>

could express in words the greatness of His goodness toward us? Human nature is joined
to Godhead, while both natures remain independent.”</p>

<p>From his fourth catechetical oration concerning the ten dogmas.</p>
<p>Of the birth from a virgin:—</p>
<p>“Believe thou that this only begotten Son of God, on account of our sins, came down
from heaven to earth, having taken on Him this manhood of like passions with us, and being
born of holy Virgin and of Holy Ghost. This incarnation was effected, not in seeming and
unreality, but in reality. He did not only pass through the Virgin, as through a channel, but
was verily made flesh of her. Like us He really ate, and of the Virgin was really suckled. For
if the incarnation was an unreality, then our salvation is a delusion. The Christ was twofold—
the visible man, the invisible God. He ate as man, verily like ourselves, for the flesh
that He wore was of like passions with us; He fed the five thousand with five loaves1387 as

<p>Testimony of the holy Hilarius, bishop and confessor,1391in his ninth book, “de Fide”:</p>
<p>“He who knoweth not Jesus the Christ as very God and as very man, knoweth not in
reality his own life, for we incur the same peril if we deny Christ Jesus or God the spirit, or
the flesh of our own body. ‘Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I
confess also before my Father which is in Heaven, but whosoever shall deny me before men
him will I also deny before my Father which is in Heaven.’1392 These things spoke the Word
made flesh; these things the man Christ Jesus, Lord of Glory, taught, being made Mediator
for the salvation of the Church in the very mystery whereby He mediated between God and
men. Both being made one out of the natures united for this very purpose, He was one and
the same through either nature, but so that in both He fell short in neither, lest haply by
being born as man He should cease to be God, or by remaining God should not be man.
Therefore this is the blessedness of the true faith among men to preach both God and man,
to confess both word and flesh, to recognise that God was also man, and not to be ignorant
that the flesh is also Word.”</p>

<p>Of the same from the same book:1393—</p>
<p>“So the only begotten God being born man of a Virgin and in the fulness of the time,
being Himself ordained to work out the advance of man to God, observed this order of
things, through all the words of the gospels, that He might teach belief in Himself, as Son
of God, and keep us in mind to preach Him as Son of Man. As being man He always spoke
and acted as is proper to man, but in such a manner as never to speak in this same mode of
speech as touching both save with the intention of signifying both God and Man. But hence
the heretics derive a pretext for catching in their traps simple and ignorant men: what was
spoken by our Lord in accordance with His manhood they falsely assert to have been uttered
in the weakness of His divine nature, and since one and the same person spake all the words
He used they urged that all He uttered He uttered about Himself. Now even we do not deny
that all His extant words are of His own nature. But granted that the one Christ is man and
God; granted that when man He was not then first God; granted that when man He was
then also God, granted that after the assumption of the manhood in the Lord, the Word
was man and the Word was God, it follows of necessity that there is one and the same
mystery of His words as there is of His generation. Whenever in Him, as occasion may re-

quire, you distinguish the manhood from the Godhead, then also endeavour to separate the
words of God from the words of man. And whenever you confess God and man, then discern
the words of God and man. And when the words are spoken of God and man, and again of
man wholly and wholly of God, consider carefully the occasion. If anything was spoken to
signify what was appropriate to a particular occasion, apply the words to the occasion. A
distinction must be observed between God before the manhood, man and God, man wholly
and God wholly after the union of the manhood and Godhead. Take heed therefore not to
confuse the mystery of the incarnation in the words and acts. For it must needs be that according
to the quality of the kinds of natures a distinction lies in the manner of speech, before
the manhood was born, in accordance with the mystery when it was still approaching death,
and again when it was everlasting. ‘For if in His birth and in His passion and in His death
He acted in accordance with our nature He nevertheless effected all this by the power of
His own nature.’”</p>
<p>Of the same in the same book:—</p>
<p>“Do you then see that thus God and man are confessed, so that death is predicated of
man, and the resurrection of the flesh, of God; for consider the nature of God and the power
of the resurrection, and recognise in the death the oeconomy as touching man. And since
both death and resurrection have been brought about in their own natures, bear in mind, I
beg you, the one Christ Jesus, who was of both. I have shortly demonstrated these points to
you to the end that we may remember both natures to have been in our Lord Jesus Christ
‘for being in the form of God He took the form of a servant.’”1394</p>
<p>Testimony of the very holy bishop Augustinus.</p>
<p>From his letter to Volusianus. Epistle III:</p>
<p>“But now He appeared as Mediator between God and man, so as in the unity of His
person to conjoin both natures, by combining the wonted with the unwonted, and the unwonted
with the wonted.”</p>

divine nature.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his book on the Exposition at the Faith:—</p>
<p>“It is ours to believe, but His to know, and so let God the Word Himself, after receiving
all that is proper to man, be man, and let man after His assumption and reception of all that

Himself without the natural corruption, and He is mixed in reality. He knows also that He
so received in Himself as that no addition of increment accrues to Himself, as also He knows
He infused His whole self so as to incur no diminution. Let us not then, in accordance with
our weak intelligence, and forming conjectures on the teaching of experience and the senses,
suppose that God and man are mixed after the manner of things created and equal mixed
together, and that from such a confusion as this of the Word and of the flesh a body as it
were was made. God forbid that this should be our belief, lest we should suppose that after
the manner of things which are confounded together two natures were brought into one
hypostasis.1396 For a mention of this kind implies destruction of both parts; but Christ
Himself, containing but not contained, who examines us but is Himself beyond examination,
making full but not made full, everywhere at one and the same time being Himself whole
and pervading the universe, through His pouring out His own power, as being moved with
mercy, was mingled with the nature of man, though the nature of man was not mingled
with the divine.”</p>

impassible nature, but in flesh, being brought near to death, at one and the same time shews
the kindred nature of the flesh how through death to despise death, and by His death confirms

natures came together in inseparable union without confusion and without division,1403

<note type="footnote">1401 The word in the text is the famous θεοτόκος, the watchword of the Nestorian controversy. It may be
doubtful whether either the English “Mother of God” or the Latin “Deipara” exactly represents the idea intended
to be expressed by the subtler Greek. Even Nestorius did not object to the Θεοτόκος when rightly understood.
The explanation of the symbolum drawn up by Theodoret himself at Ephesus for presentation to the Emperor
is “᾽Ενα χριστὸν, ἕνα υἱU+0026 232·ν, ἕνα κύριον ὁμολογοῦμεν. κατὰ ταύτην τῆς ἀσυγχύτου ἑνώσεως ἔννοιαν

αὐτῆς τῆς συλλήψεως ἑνῶσαι ἑαυτῷ τὸν ἐξ αὐτῆς ληφθέντα ναόν.” The great point sought to be asserted was,
the union of the two Natures. Gregory of Nazianzus (li. 738) says ῎Ει τις οὐ θεοτόκον τὴν Μαρίαν ὑπολαμβάνει
χωρίς ἐστι τῆς Θεότητος</note>

are but four things which concur to make complete the whole state of our Lord Jesus Christ: his Deity, his manhood, the
conjunction of both, and the distinction of the one from the other being joined in one. Four principal heresies there are
which have in those things withstood the truth: Arians, by bending themselves against the Deity of Christ; Apollinarians,
by maiming and misinterpreting that which belongeth to his human nature; Nestorians, by rending Christ asunder, and
dividing him into two persons; the followers of Eutyches, by confounding in his person those natures which they should
distinguish. Against these there have been four most famous ancient general councils: the council of Nice to define against
Arians; against Apollinarians the Council of Constantinople; the councilor Ephesus against Nestorians; against Eutychians
the Chalcedon Council. In four words, ἀληθῶς, τελέως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀσυγχύτως, truly, perfectly, indivisibly, distinctly;
the first applied to his being God, and the second to his being Man, the third to his being of both One, and the fourth to
his continuing in that one Both: we may fully by way of Abridgement comprise whatsoever antiquity hath at large handled
either in declaration of Christian belief, or in refutation of the foresaid heresies. Within the compass of which four heads,</note>

<pb n="474"/>
for the flesh is flesh and no kind of Godhead, although it was made flesh of God; in like
manner the Word is God, and not flesh, although He made the flesh His own according to
the oeconomy.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the Epistle to the Hebrews:—</p>
<p>“For although the natures which came together in unity are regarded as different and
unequal with one another, I mean of flesh and of God, nevertheless the Son, Who was made
of both, is one.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the same Epistle:—</p>
<p>“Yet though the only begotten Word of God is said to be united in hypostasis to flesh,
we deny there was any confusion of the natures with one another, and declare each to remain
what it is.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his commentaries:—</p>
<p>“The Father’s Word, born of the Virgin, is named man, though being by nature God as
partaking of flesh and blood like us1404 for thus He was seen by men upon earth, without
getting rid of His own nature, but assuming our Manhood perfect according to its own
reason.”</p>
<p>Of the same concerning the Incarnation (Schol. c. 13):—</p>
<p>“Then before the incarnation there is one Very God, and in manhood He remains what
He was and is and will be; the one Lord Jesus Christ then must not be separated into man
apart and into God apart, but recognising the difference of the natures and preserving them
unconfounded with one another, we assert that there is one and the same Christ Jesus.”
Of the same after other commentaries:—
“There is plain perception of one thing dwelling in another, namely the divine nature
in manhood, without undergoing commixture or any confusion, or any change into what
it was not. For what is said to dwell in another does not become the same as that in which
it dwells, but is rather regarded as one thing in another. But in the nature of the Word and
of the manhood the difference points out to us a difference of natures alone, for of both is
perceived one Christ. Therefore he says that the Word ‘Tabernacled among us,’1405 carefully
observing the freedom from confusion, for he recognises one only begotten Son who was
made flesh and became man.”</p>

but after the passion which wrought salvation, and the resurrection, and the ascension, they
have shewn the union of the Godhead and of the manhood to be without confusion.</p>
<p>Eran.—I did not suppose that they distinguished the natures after the union, but I have
found an infinite amount of distinction.</p>
<p>Orth.—It is mad and rash against those noble champions of the faith so much as to wag
your tongue. But I will adduce for you the words of Apollinarius, in order that you may
know that he too asserts the union to be without confusion. Now hear his words.</p>
<p>Testimony of Apollinarius.</p>
<p>From his summary:—</p>
<p>“There is an union between what is of God and what is of the body. On the one side is
the adorable Creator Who is wisdom and power eternal; these are of the Godhead. On the
other hand is the Son of Mary, born at the last time, worshipping God, advancing in wisdom,
strengthened in power; these are of the body. The suffering on behalf of sin and the curse
came and will not pass away nor yet be changed into the incorporeal.”</p>
<p>And again a little further on:—</p>
<p>“Men are consubstantial with the unreasoning animals as far as the unreasoning body
is concerned; they are of another substance in so far forth as they are reasonable. Just so
God who is consubstantial with men according to the flesh is of another substance in so far
forth as He is Word and Man.”</p>
<p>And in another place he says:—</p>
<p>“Of things which are mingled together the qualities are mixed and not destroyed. Thus
it comes to pass that some are separate from the mixed parts as wine from water, nor yet is
there mingling with a body, nor yet as of bodies with bodies, but the mingling preserves
also the unmixed, so that, as each occasion may require, the energy of the Godhead either
acts independently or in conjunction, as was the case when the Lord fasted, for the Godhead
being in conjunction in proportion to its being above need, hunger was hindered, but when
it no longer opposed to the craving its superiority to need, then hunger arose, to the undoing
of the devil. But if the mixture of the bodies suffered no change, how much more that of the
Godhead?”</p>
<p>And in another place he says:—</p>
<p>“If the mixture with iron which makes the iron itself fire does not change its nature, so
too the union of God with the body implies no change of the body, even though the body
extend its divine energies to what is within its reach.”</p>
<p>To this he immediately adds:—</p>
<p>“If a man has both soul and body, and these remain in unity, much more does the Christ,
who has Godhead and body, keep both secure and unconfounded.”</p>
<p>And again a little further on:—</p>

<pb n="476"/>
<p>“For human nature is partaker of the divine energy, as far as it is capable, but it is as
distinct as the least from the greatest. Man is a servant of God, but God is not servant of
man, nor even of Himself. Man is a creature of God, but God is not a creature of man, nor
even of Himself.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“If any one takes in reference to Godhead and not in reference to flesh the passage the
‘Son doeth what He seeth the Father do,’1406 wherein He Who was made flesh is distinct
from the Father Who was not made flesh, divides two divine energies. But there is no division.
So He does not speak in reference to Godhead.”</p>
<p>Again he says:—</p>
<p>“As man is not an unreasoning being, on account of the contact of the reasoning and
the unreasoning, just so the Saviour is not a creature on account of the contact of the creature
with God uncreate.”</p>
<p>To this he also adds:—</p>
<p>“The invisible which is united to a visible body and thereby is beheld, remains invisible,
and it remains without composition because it is not circumscribed with the body, and the
body, remaining in its own measure, accepts the union with God in accordance with its
being quickened, nor is it that which is quickened which quickens.”</p>
<p>And a little further on he says:—</p>
<p>“If the mixture with soul and body, although from the beginning they coalesce, does
not make the soul visible on account of the body, nor change it into the other properties of
the body, so as to allow of its being cut or lessened, how much rather God, who is not of the
same nature as the body, is united to the body without undergoing change, if the body of
man remains in its own nature, and this when it is animated by a soul, then in the case of
Christ the commingling does not so change the body as that it is not a body.”</p>
<p>And further on he says again:—</p>
<p>“He who confesses that soul and body are constituted one by the Scripture, is inconsistent
with himself when he asserts that this union of the Word with the body is a change, such
change being not even beheld in the case of a soul.”</p>
<p>Listen to him again exclaiming clearly:—</p>
<p>“If they are impious who deny that the flesh of the Lord abides, much more are they
who refuse wholly to accept His incarnation.”</p>
<p>And in his little book about the Incarnation he has written:—</p>
<p>“The words ‘Sit thou on my right hand’1407 He speaks as to man, for they are not spoken
to Him that sits ever on the throne of glory, as God the Word after His ascension from earth,
<note type="footnote">1406 John v. 19</note>
<note type="footnote">1407 Ps. cx. 1</note>

<pb n="477"/>
but they are said to Him who hath now been exalted to the heavenly glory as man, as the
Apostles say ‘for David is not ascended into the heavens, but he saith himself the Lord said
unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand.’1408 The order is human, giving a beginning to
the sitting; but it is a divine dignity to sit together with God ‘to whom thousand thousands
minister and before whom ten thousand times ten thousand stand.’”1409</p>
<p>And again a little further on:—</p>
<p>“He does not put His enemies under Him as God but as man, but so that the God who
is seen and man are the same. Paul too teaches us that the words ‘until I make thy foes thy
footstool’1410 are spoken to men, describing the success as His own of course in accordance
with His divinity ‘According to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things
unto Himself.’1411 Behold Godhead and manhood existing inseparably in One Person.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“‘Glorify me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world
was.’1412 The word ‘glorify’ He uses as man, but His having this glory before the ages He
reveals as God.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“But let us not be humiliated as thinking the worship of the Son of God humiliation,
even in His human likeness, but as though honouring some king appearing in poor raiment
with his royal glory, and above all seeing that the very garb in which He is clad is glorified,
as became the body of God and of the world’s Saviour which is seed of eternal life, instrument
of divine deeds, destroyer of all wickedness, slayer of death and prince of resurrection; for
though it had its nature from man it derived its life from God, and its power and divine
virtue from heaven.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“Whence we worship the body as the Word; we partake of the body as of the spirit.”</p>
<p>Now it has been plainly shewn you that the author who was first to introduce the mixture
of the natures openly uses the argument of a distinction between them; thus he has called
the body garb, creature and instrument; he even went so far as to call it slave, which none
of us has ever ventured to do. He also says that it was deemed worthy of the seat on the right
hand, and uses many other expressions which are rejected by your vain heresy.</p>
<p>Eran.—But why then did he who was the first to introduce the mixture insert so great
a distinction in his arguments?</p>

<p>Orth.—The power of truth forces even them that vehemently fight against her to agree
with what she says, but, if you will, let us now begin a discussion about the impassibility of
the Lord.</p>
<p>Eran.—You know that musicians are accustomed to give their strings rest, and they
slacken them by turning the pegs; if then things altogether void of reason and soul stand in
need of some recreation, we who partake of both shall do nothing absurd if we mete out
our labour in proportion to our power. Let us then put it off till tomorrow.</p>

<head>Dialogue III.—The Impassible.</head>
<p>Orthodoxus and Eranistes.</p>
<p>Orth.—In our former discussions we have proved that God the Word is immutable,
and became incarnate not by being changed into flesh, but by taking perfect human nature.
The divine Scripture, and the teachers of the churches and luminaries of the world have
clearly taught us that, after the union, He remained as He was, unmixed, impassible, unchanged,
uncircumscribed; and that He preserved unimpaired the nature which He had
taken. For the future then the subject before us is that of His passion, and it will be a very
profitable one, for thence have been brought to us the waters of salvation.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am also of opinion that this discourse will be beneficial. I shall not however
consent to our former method, but I propose myself to ask questions.</p>
<p>Orth.—And I will answer, without making any objection to the change of method. He
who has truth on his side, not only when he questions but also when he is questioned, is
supported by the might of the truth. Ask then what you will.</p>
<p>Eran.—Who, according to your view, suffered the passion?</p>
<p>Orth.—Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then a man gave us our salvation.</p>
<p>Orth.—No; for have we confessed that our Lord Jesus Christ was only man?</p>
<p>Eran.—Now define what you believe Christ to be.</p>
<p>Orth.—Incarnate Son of the living God.</p>
<p>Eran.—And is the Son of God God?</p>
<p>Orth.—God, having the same substance as the God Who begat Him.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then God underwent the passion.</p>
<p>Orth.—If He was nailed to the cross without a body, apply the passion to the Godhead;
but if he was made man by taking flesh, why then do you exempt the passible from the
passion and subject the impassible to it?</p>
<p>Eran.—But the reason why He took flesh was that the impassible might undergo the
passion by means of the passible.</p>
<p>Orth.—You say impassible and apply passion to Him.</p>
<p>Eran.—I said that He took flesh to suffer.</p>
<p>Orth.—If He had had a nature capable of the Passion He would have suffered without
flesh; so the flesh becomes superfluous.</p>
<p>Eran.—The divine nature is immortal, and the nature of the flesh mortal, so the immortal
was united with the mortal, that through it He might taste of death.</p>
<p>Orth.—That which is by nature immortal does not undergo death, even when conjoined
with the mortal; this is easy to see.</p>
<p>Eran.—Prove it; and remove the difficulty.</p>

<pb n="480"/>
<p>Orth.—Do you assert that the human soul was immortal, or mortal?</p>
<p>Eran.—Immortal.</p>
<p>Orth.—And is the body mortal or immortal?</p>
<p>Eran.—Indubitably mortal.</p>
<p>Orth.—And do we say that man consists of these natures?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—So the immortal is conjoined with the mortal?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—But when the connexion or union is at an end, the mortal submits to the law of
death, while the soul remains immortal though sin has introduced death, or do you not hold
death to be a penalty?</p>
<p>Eran.—So divine Scripture teaches. For we learn that when God forbade Adam to partake
of the tree of knowledge He added “on the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die.”1413</p>
<p>Orth.—Then death is the punishment of them that have sinned?</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why then, when soul and body have both sinned together, does the body alone
undergo the punishment of death?</p>
<p>Eran.—It was the body that cast its evil eye upon the tree, and stretched forth its hands,
and plucked the forbidden fruit. It was the mouth that bit it with the teeth, and ground it
small, and then the gullet committed it to the belly, and the belly digested it, and delivered
it to the liver; and the liver turned what it had received into blood and passed it on to the
hollow vein1414 and the vein to the adjacent parts and they through the rest, and so the theft
of the forbidden food pervaded the whole body. Very properly then the body alone underwent
the punishment of sin.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have given us a physiological disquisition on the nature of food, on all the
parts that it goes through and on the modifications to which it is subject before it is assimilated
with the body. But there is one point that you have refused to observe, and that is that
the body goes through none of these processes which you have mentioned without the soul.
When bereft of the soul which is its yoke mate the body lies breathless, voiceless, motionless;
the eye sees neither wrong nor aright; no sound of voices reaches the ears, the hands cannot
stir; the feet cannot walk; the body is like an instrument without music. How then can you
say that only the body sinned when the body without the soul cannot even take a breath?</p>

the main “orthodox” even now, and shews that Theodoret was well abreast of the science accepted before the
discovery of the circulation of the blood.</note>


<pb n="481"/>
<p>Eran.—The body does indeed receive life from the soul, and it furnishes the soul with
the penal possession of sin.</p>
<p>Orth.—How, and in what manner?</p>
<p>Eran.—Through the eyes it makes it see amiss; through the ears it makes it hear unprofitable
sounds; and through the tongue utter injurious words, and through all the other parts
act ill.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then I suppose we may say Blessed are the deaf; blessed are they that have lost
their sight and have been deprived of their other faculties, for the souls of men so incapacitated
have neither part nor lot in the wickedness of the body. And why, O most sagacious
sir, have you mentioned those functions of the body which are culpable, and said nothing
about the laudable? It is possible to look with eyes of love and of kindliness; it is possible to
wipe away a tear of compunction, to hear oracles of God, to bend the ear to the poor, to
praise the Creator with the tongue, to give good lessons to our neighbour, to move the hand
in mercy, and in a word to use the parts of the body for complete acquisition of goodness.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is all true.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the observance and transgression of law is common to both soul and
body.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—It seems to me that the soul takes the leading part in both, since it uses reasoning
before the body acts.</p>
<p>Eran.—In what sense do you say this?</p>
<p>Orth.—First of all the mind makes, as it were, a sketch of virtue or of vice, and then
gives to one or the other form with appropriate material and colour, using for its instruments
the parts of the body.</p>
<p>Eran.—So it seems.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then the soul sins with the body; nay rather takes the lead in the sin, for to it
is entrusted the bridling and direction of the animal part, why, as it shares the sin, does it
not also share the punishment?</p>
<p>Eran.—But how were it possible for the immortal soul to share death?</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet it were just that after sharing the transgression, it should share the chastisement.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, just.</p>
<p>Orth.—But it did not do so.</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—At least in the life to come it will be sent with the body to Gehenna.</p>
<p>Eran.—So He said “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul;
but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”1415</p>
<note type="footnote">1415 Matt. x. 28</note>

<pb n="482"/>
<p>Orth.—Therefore in this life it escapes death, as being immortal; in the life to come, it
will be punished, not by undergoing death, but by suffering chastisement in life.</p>
<p>Eran.—That is what the divine Scripture says.</p>
<p>Orth.—It is then impossible for the immortal nature to undergo death.</p>
<p>Eran.—So it appears.</p>
<p>Orth.—How then do you say, God the Word tasted death? For if that which was created
immortal is seen to be incapable of becoming mortal, how is it possible for him that is
without creation and eternally immortal, Creator of mortal and immortal natures alike, to
partake of death?</p>
<p>Eran.—We too know that His nature is immortal, but we say that He shared death in
the flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—But we have plainly shewn that it is in no wise possible for that which is by nature
immortal to share death, for even the soul created together with, and conjoined with, the
body and sharing in its sin, does not share death with it, on account of the immortality of
its nature alone. But let us look at this same position from another point of view.</p>
<p>Eran.—There is every reason why we should leave no means untried to arrive at the
truth.</p>
<p>Orth.—Let us then examine the matter thus. Do we assert that of virtue and vice some
are teachers and some are followers?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And do we say that the teacher of virtue deserves greater recompense?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And similarly the teacher of vice deserves twofold and threefold punishment?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what part shall we assign to the devil, that of teacher or disciple?</p>
<p>Eran.—Teacher of teachers, for he himself is father and teacher of all iniquity.</p>
<p>Orth.—And who of men became his first disciples?</p>
<p>Eran.—Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Orth.—And who received the sentence of death?</p>
<p>Eran.—Adam and all his race.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then the disciples were punished for the bad lessons they had learnt, but the
teacher, whom we have just declared to deserve two-fold and three-fold chastisement, got
off the punishment?</p>
<p>Eran.—Apparently.</p>
<p>Orth.—And though this so came about we both acknowledge and declare that the Judge
is just.</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly.</p>
<p>Orth.—But, being just, why did He not exact an account from him of his evil teaching?</p>

<pb n="483"/>
<p>Eran.—He prepared for him the unquenchable flame of Gehenna, for, He says, “Depart
from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”1416 And the
reason why he did not here share death with his disciples is because he has an immortal
nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then even the greatest transgressors cannot incur death if they have an immortal
nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then even the very inventor and teacher of iniquity did not incur death on
account of the immortality of his nature, do you not shudder at the thought of saying that
the fount of immortality and righteousness shared death?</p>
<p>Eran.—Had we said that he underwent the passion involuntarily, there would have been
some just ground for the accusation which you bring against us. But if the passion which is
preached by us was spontaneous and the death voluntary, it becomes you, instead of accusing
us, to praise the immensity of His love to man. For He suffered because He willed to suffer,
and shared death because He wished it.</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem to me to be quite ignorant of the divine nature, for the Lord God
wishes nothing inconsistent with His nature, and is able to do all that He wishes, and what
He wishes is appropriate and agreeable to His own nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have learnt that all things are possible with God.1417</p>
<p>Orth.—In expressing yourself thus indefinitely you include even what belongs to the
Devil, for to say absolutely all things is to name together not only good, but its opposite.</p>
<p>Eran.—But did not the noble Job speak absolutely when he said “I know that thou canst
do all things and with thee nothing is impossible”?1418</p>
<p>Orth.—If you read what the just man said before, you will see the meaning of the one
passage from the other, for he says “Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as
the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again? Hast thou not poured me out as milk and
curdled me like cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with
bones and sinews, thou hast granted me life and favour.”1419</p>
<p>And then he adds:—</p>
<p>“Having this in myself I know that thou canst do all things and that with thee nothing
is impossible.”1420 Is it not therefore all that belongs to these things that he alleges to belong
to the incorruptible nature, to the God of the universe?</p>

<p>Eran.—Nothing is impossible to Almighty God.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then according to your definition sin is possible to Almighty God?</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—Wherefore?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because He does not wish it.</p>
<p>Orth.—Wherefore does He not wish it?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because sin is foreign to His nature.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then there are many things which He cannot do, for there are many kinds of
transgression.</p>
<p>Eran.—Nothing of this kind can be wished or done by God.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor can those things which are contrary to the divine nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—What are they?</p>
<p>Orth.—As, for instance, we have learnt that God is intelligent and true Light.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And we could not call Him darkness or say that He wished to become, or could
become, darkness.</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—Again, the Divine Scripture calls His nature invisible.</p>
<p>Eran.—It does.</p>
<p>Orth.—And we could never say that It is capable of being made visible.</p>
<p>Eran.—No, surely.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor comprehensible.</p>
<p>Eran.—No; for He is not so.</p>
<p>Orth.—No; for He is incomprehensible, and altogether unapproachable.</p>
<p>Eran.—You are right.</p>
<p>Orth.—And He that is could never become non-existent.</p>
<p>Eran.—Away with the thought!</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor yet could the Father become Son.</p>
<p>Eran.—Impossible.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor yet could the unbegotten become begotten.</p>
<p>Eran.—How could He.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the Father could never become Son?</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor could the Holy Ghost ever become Son or Father.</p>
<p>Eran.—All this is impossible.</p>
<p>Orth.—And we shall find many other things of the same kind, which are similarly impossible,
for the Eternal will not become of time, nor the Uncreate created and made, nor
the infinite finite, and the like.</p>

<pb n="485"/>
<p>Eran.—None of these is possible.</p>
<p>Orth.—So we have found many things which are impossible to Almighty God.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—But not to be able in any of these respects is proof not of weakness, but of infinite
power, and to be able would certainly be proof not of power but of impotence.</p>
<p>Eran.—How do you say this?</p>
<p>Orth.—Because each one of these proclaims the unchangeable and invariable character
of God. For the impossibility of good becoming evil signifies the immensity of the goodness;
and that He that is just should never become unjust, nor He that is true a liar, exhibits the
stability and the strength that there is in truth and righteousness. Thus the true light could
never become darkness; He that is could never become nonexistent, for the existence is
perpetual and the light is naturally invariable. And so, after examining all other examples,
you will find that the not being able is declaratory of the highest power. That things of this
kind are impossible in the case of God, the divine Apostle also both perceived and laid down,
for in his Epistle to the Hebrews1421 he says, “that by two immutable things, in which it was
impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation.”1422 He shews that this incapacity
is not weakness, but very power, for he asserts Him to be so true that it is impossible
for there to be even a lie in Him. So the power of truth is signified through its want of power.
And writing to the blessed Timothy, the Apostle adds “It is a faithful saying, for if we be
dead with Him we shall also live with Him, if we suffer we shall also reign with Him; if we
deny Him He will also deny us, if we believe not yet He abideth faithful, He cannot deny
Himself.”1423 Again then the phrase “He cannot” is indicative of infinite power, for even
though all men deny Him He says God is Himself, and cannot exist otherwise than in His
own nature, for His being is indestructible. This is what is meant by the words “He cannot
deny Himself.” Therefore the impossibility of change for the worse proves infinity of power.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is quite true and in harmony with the divine words.</p>
<p>Orth.—Granted then that with God many things are impossible,—everything, that is,
which is repugnant to the divine nature,—how comes it that while you omit all the other
qualities which belong to the divine nature, goodness, righteousness, truth, invisibility, incomprehensibility,
infinity, and eternity, and the rest of the attributes which we assert to be
proper to God, you maintain that His immortality and impassibility alone are subject to
<note type="footnote">1421 Cf. note on Page 37. From the middle of the IIIrd century onward we find acceptation of the Pauline
authorship. Among writers who quote the Ep. as St. Paul’s are Cyril of Jerusalem, the two Gregories, Basil, and

change, and in them concede the possibility of variation and give to God a capacity indicative
of weakness?</p>
<p>Eran.—We have learnt this from the divine Scripture. The divine John exclaims “God
so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,”1424 and the divine Paul, “For if
when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being
reconciled we shall be saved by His life.”1425</p>
<p>Orth.—Of course all this is true, for these are divine oracles,1426 but remember what
we have often confessed.</p>
<p>Eran.—What?</p>
<p>Orth.—We have confessed that God the Word the Son of God did not appear without
a body, but assumed perfect human nature.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; this we have confessed.</p>
<p>Orth.—And He was called Son of Man because He took a body and human soul.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ is verily our God; for of these two natures the
one was His from everlasting and the other He assumed.</p>
<p>Eran.—Indubitably.</p>
<p>Orth.—While, then, as man He underwent the passion, as God He remained incapable
of suffering.</p>
<p>Eran.—How then does the divine Scripture say that the Son of God suffered?</p>
<p>Orth.—Because the body which suffered was His body. But let us look at the matter
thus; when we hear the divine Scripture saying “And it came to pass when Isaac was old his
eyes were dim so that he could not see,”1427 whither is our mind carried and on what does
it rest, on Isaac’s soul or on his body?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course on his body.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do we then conjecture that his soul also shared in the affection of blindness?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—We assert that only his body was deprived of the sense of sight?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And again when we hear Amaziah saying to the prophet Amos, “Oh thou seer
go flee away into the land of Judah,”1428 and Saul enquiring: “Tell me I pray thee where the
seer’s house is,”1429 we understand nothing bodily.</p>

<pb n="487"/>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—And yet the words used are significant of the health of the organ of sight.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet we know that the power of the Spirit when given to purer souls inspires
prophetic grace and causes them to see even hidden things, and, in consequence of their
thus seeing, they are called seers and beholders.</p>
<p>Eran.—What you say is true.</p>
<p>Orth.—And let us consider this too.</p>
<p>Eran.—What?</p>
<p>Orth.—When we hear the story of the divine evangelists narrating how they brought
to God a man sick of the palsy, laid upon a bed, do we say that this was paralysis of the parts
of the soul or of the body?</p>
<p>Eran.—Plainly of the body.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when while reading the Epistle to the Hebrews we light upon the passage
where the Apostle says “Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees
and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but
let it rather be healed,”1430 do we say that the divine Apostle said these things about the
parts of the body?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—Shall we say that he was for removing the feebleness and infirmity of the soul
and stimulating the disciples to manliness?</p>
<p>Eran.—Obviously.</p>
<p>Orth.—But we do not find these things distinguished in the divine Scripture, for in describing
the blindness of Isaac he made no reference to the body, but spoke of Isaac as absolutely
blind, nor in describing the prophets as seers and beholders did he say that their souls
saw and beheld what was hidden, but mentioned the persons themselves.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; this is so.</p>
<p>Orth.—And he did not point out that the body of the paralytic was palsied, but called
the man a paralytic.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And even the divine Apostle made no special mention of the souls, though it
was these that he purposed to strengthen and to rouse.</p>
<p>Eran.—No; he did not.</p>
<p>Orth.—But when we examine the meaning of the words, we understand which belongs
to the soul and which to the body.</p>
<p>Eran.—And very naturally; for God made us reasonable beings.</p>
<note type="footnote">1430 Heb. xii. 12, 13</note>

<pb n="488"/>
<p>Orth.—Then let us make use of this reasoning faculty in the case of our Maker and Saviour,
and let us recognise what belongs to His Godhead and what to His manhood.</p>
<p>Eran.—But by doing this we shall destroy the supreme union.</p>
<p>Orth.—In the case of Isaac, of the prophets, of the man sick of the palsy, and of the rest,
we did so without destroying the natural union of the soul and of the body; we did not even
separate the souls from their proper bodies, but by reason alone distinguished what belonged
to the soul and what to the body. Is it not then monstrous that while we take this course in
the case of souls and bodies, we should refuse to do so in the case of our Saviour, and confound
natures which differ not in the same proportion as soul from body, but in as vast a
degree as the temporal from the eternal and the Creator from the created?</p>
<p>Eran.—The divine Scripture says that the Son of God underwent the passion.
Orth.—We deny that it was suffered by any other, but none the less, taught by the divine
Scripture, we know that the nature of the Godhead is impassible. We are told of impassibility
and of passion, of manhood and of Godhead, and we therefore attribute the passion to the
passible body, and confess that no passion was undergone by the nature that was impassible.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then a body won our salvation for us.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; but not a mere man’s body, but that of our Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten
Son of God. If you regard this body as insignificant and of small account, how can
you hold its type to be an object of worship and a means of salvation? and how can the archetype
be contemptible and insignificant of that of which the type is adorable and honourable?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do not look on the body as of small account, but I object to dividing it from
the Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—We, my good sir, do not divide the union but we regard the peculiar properties
of the natures, and I am sure that in a moment you will take the same view.</p>
<p>Eran.—You talk like a prophet.</p>
<p>Orth.—No; not like a prophet, but as knowing the power of truth. But now answer me
this. When you hear the Lord saying “I and my Father are one,”1431 and “He that hath seen
me hath seen the Father,”1432 do you say that this refers to the flesh or to the Godhead?</p>
<p>Eran.—How can the flesh and the Father possibly be of one substance?</p>
<p>Orth.—Then these passages indicate the Godhead?
Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And so with the text, “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was
God,”1433 and the like.</p>

<pb n="489"/>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Again when the divine Scripture says, “Jesus therefore being wearied with his
journey sat thus on the well,”1434 of what is the weariness to be understood, of the Godhead
or of the body?</p>
<p>Eran.—I cannot bear to divide what is united.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then it seems you attribute the weariness to the divine nature?</p>
<p>Eran.—I think so.</p>
<p>Orth.—But then you directly contradict the exclamation of the prophet “He fainteth
not neither is weary; there is no searching of His understanding. He giveth power to the
faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.”1435 And a little further on
“But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings
as eagles, they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint.”1436 Now how
can He who bestows upon others the boon of freedom from weariness and want, possibly
be himself subject to hunger and thirst?</p>
<p>Eran.—I have said over and over again that God is impassible, and free from all want,
but after the incarnation He became capable of suffering.</p>
<p>Orth.—But did He do this by admitting the sufferings in His Godhead, or by permitting
the passible nature to undergo its natural sufferings and by suffering proclaim that what
was seen was no unreality, but was really assumed of human nature? But now let us look at
the matter thus: we say that the divine nature was uncircumscribed.</p>
<p>Eran.—Aye.</p>
<p>Orth.—And uncircumscribed nature is circumscribed by none.</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course not.</p>
<p>Orth.—It therefore needs no transition for it is everywhere.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And that which needs no transition needs not to travel.</p>
<p>Eran.—That is clear.</p>
<p>Orth.—And that which does not travel does not grow weary.</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—It follows then that the divine nature, which is uncircumscribed, and needs not
to travel, was not weary.</p>
<p>Eran.—But the divine Scripture says that Jesus was weary, and Jesus is God; “And our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.”1437</p>

<pb n="490"/>
<p>Orth.—But the exact expression of the divine Scripture is that Jesus “was wearied” not
“is wearied.”1438 We must consider how one and the other can be applied to the same person.</p>
<p>Eran.—Well; try to point this out, for you are always for forcing on us the distinction
of terms.</p>
<p>Orth.—I think that even a barbarian might easily make this distinction. The union of
unlike natures being conceded, the person of Christ on account of the union receives both;
to each nature its own properties are attributed; to the uncircumscribed immunity from
weariness, to that which is capable of transition and travel weariness. For travelling is the
function of the feet; of the muscles to be strained by over exercise.</p>
<p>Eran.—There is no controversy about these being bodily affections.</p>
<p>Orth.—Well then; the prediction which I made, and you scoffed at, has come true; for
look; you have shewn us what belongs to manhood, and what belongs to Godhead.</p>
<p>Eran.—But I have not divided one son into two.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nor do we, my friend; but giving heed to the difference of the natures, we consider
what befits godhead, and what is proper to a body.</p>
<p>Eran.—This distinction is not the teaching of the divine Scripture; it says that the Son
of God died. So the Apostle;—“For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by
the death of His Son.”1439 And he says that the Lord was raised from the dead for “God” he
says “raised the Lord from the dead.”1440</p>
<p>Orth.—And when the divine Scripture says “And devout men carried Stephen to his
burial and made great lamentation over him”1441 would any one say that his soul was
committed to the grave as well as his body?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course not.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when you hear the Patriarch Jacob saying “Bury me with my Fathers,”1442
do you suppose this refers to the body or to the soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—To the body; without question.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now read what follows.</p>
<p>Eran.—“There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and
Rebekah his wife and there I buried Leah.”1443</p>
<note type="footnote">1438 The text of John iv. 6 is κεκοπιακὼς ἐκαθέζετο, i.e., after being weary sate down. κοπιῶν ἐκαθέζετο

have been wearied once,—not to be wearied now; though of course in classical Greek λέγει (historicè) αὐτὸν
κοπιᾶν might mean “said that he was in a state of weariness.”</note>

<pb n="491"/>
<p>Orth.—Now, in the passages which you have just read, the divine Scripture makes no
mention of the body, but as far as the words used go, signifies soul as well as body. We
however make the proper distinction and say that the souls of the patriarchs were immortal,
and that only their bodies were buried in the double cave.1444</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when we read in the Acts how Herod slew James the brother of John with
a sword,1445 we are not likely to hold that his soul died.</p>
<p>Eran.—No; how could we? We remember the Lord’s warning “Fear not them which
kill the body but are not able to kill the soul.”1446</p>
<p>Orth.—But does it not seem to you impious and monstrous in the case of mere men to
avoid the invariable connexion of soul and body, and in the case of scriptural references to
death and burial, to distinguish in thought the soul from the body and connect them only
with the body, while in trust in the teaching of the Lord you hold the soul to be immortal,
and then when you hear of the passion of the Son of God to follow quite a different course?
Are you justified in making no mention of the body to which the passion belongs, and in
representing the divine nature which is impassible, immutable and immortal as mortal and
passible? While all the while you know that if the nature of God the Word is capable of
suffering, the assumption of the body was superfluous.</p>
<p>Eran.—We have learnt from the Divine Scriptures that the Son of God suffered.</p>
<p>Orth.—But the divine apostle interprets the Passion, and shews what nature suffered.</p>
<p>Eran.—Show me this at once and clear the matter up.</p>
<p>Orth.—Are you not acquainted with the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews in which
the divine Paul1447 says “For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren saying
‘I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the Church will I sing praise unto
Thee.’ And again, ‘Behold I and the children which God hath given me.’”1448</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes, I know this, but this does not give us what you promised.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes: even these suggest what I promised to shew. The word brotherhood signifies
kinship, and the kinship is due to the assumption of the nature, and the assumption openly
<note type="footnote">1444 “The Machpelah,” always in Hebrew with the article 􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀 = “the double (cave).” It is interesting
to contrast the heathen idea, that the shadow goes to Hades while the self is identified with the body, with the Christian
belief, that the self lives while the body is buried e.g. Homer (Il. i. 4) says that while the famous “wrath” sent many heroes’
souls to Hades, it made “them” a prey to dogs and birds. cf. xxiii. 72. “ψυχαὶ εἰδωλα καμόντων.”</note>

<pb n="492"/>
proclaims the impassibility of the Godhead. But to understand this the more plainly read
what follows.</p>
<p>Eran.—“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also
Himself likewise took part of the same that through death He might destroy him that hath
the power of death<gap reason="omitted"/>and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life subject
to bondage.”1449</p>
<p>Orth.—This, I think, needs no explanation; it teaches clearly the mystery of the oeconomy.</p>
<p>Eran.—I see nothing here of what you promised to prove.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet the divine Apostle teaches plainly that the Creator, pitying this nature not
only seized cruelly by death, but throughout all life made death’s slave, effected the resurrection
through a body for our bodies, and, by means of a mortal body, undid the dominion
of death; for since His own nature was immortal He righteously wished to stay the sovereignty
of death by taking the first fruits of them that were subject to death, and while He kept these
first fruits (i.e. the body) blameless and free from sin, on the one hand He gave death license
to lay hands on it and so satisfy its insatiability, while on the other, for the sake of the wrong
done to this body, he put a stop to the unrighteous sovereignty usurped over all the rest of
men. These firstfruits unrighteously engulfed He raised again and will make the race to
follow them.</p>
<p>Set this explanation side by side with the words of the Apostle, and you will understand
the impassibility of the Godhead.</p>
<p>Eran.—In what has been read there is no proof of the divine impassibility.</p>
<p>Orth.—Nay: does not the statement of the divine Apostle, that the reason of His making
the children partakers of the flesh and blood was that through death He might destroy him
that hath the power of death, distinctly signify the impassibility of the Godhead, and the
passibility of the flesh, and that because the divine nature could not suffer He assumed the
nature that could and through it destroyed the power of the devil?</p>
<p>Eran.—How did He destroy the power of the devil and the dominion of death through
the flesh?</p>
<p>Orth.—What arms did the devil use at the beginning when he enslaved the nature of
men?</p>
<p>Eran.—The means by which he took captive him who had been constituted citizen of
Paradise, was sin.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what punishment did God assign for the transgression of the commandment?</p>
<p>Eran.—Death.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then sin is the mother of death, and the devil its father.</p>
<note type="footnote">1449 Heb. ii. 14, 15</note>

<pb n="493"/>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—War then was waged against human nature by sin. Sin seduced them that obeyed
it to slavery, brought them to its vile father, and delivered them to its very bitter offspring.</p>
<p>Eran.—That is plain.</p>
<p>Orth.—So with reason the Creator, with the intention of destroying either power, assumed
the nature against which war was being waged, and, by keeping it clear of all sin,
both set it free from the sovereignty of the devil, and, by its means, destroyed the devil’s
dominion. For since death is the punishment of sinners, and death unrighteously and against
the divine law seized the sinless body of the Lord, He first raised up that which was unlawfully
detained, and then promised release to them that were with justice imprisoned.</p>
<p>Eran.—But how do you think it just that the resurrection of Him who was unlawfully
detained should be shared by the bodies which had been righteously delivered to death?</p>
<p>Orth.—And how do you think it just that, when it was Adam who transgressed the
commandment, his race should follow their forefather?</p>
<p>Eran.—Although the race had not participated in the famous transgression, yet it
committed other sins, and for this cause incurred death.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet not sinners only but just men, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and men who
have shone bright in many kinds of virtue have come into death’s meshes.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; for how could a family sprung of mortal parents remain immortal? Adam
after the transgression and the divine sentence, and after coming under the power of death,
knew his wife, and was called father; having himself become mortal he was made father of
mortals; reasonably then all who have received mortal nature follow their forefather.</p>
<p>Orth.—You have shewn very well the reason of our being partakers of death. The same
however must be granted about the resurrection, for the remedy must be meet for the disease.
When the head of the race was doomed, all the race was doomed with him, and so when
the Saviour destroyed the curse, human nature won freedom; and just as they that shared
Adam’s nature followed him in his going down into Hades, so all the nature of men will
share in newness of life with the Lord Christ in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Eran.—The decrees of the Church must be given not only declaratorily but demonstratively.
Tell me then how these doctrines are taught in the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Orth.—Listen to the Apostle writing to the Romans, and through them teaching all
mankind: “For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And
not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by one to condemnation,
but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if by one man’s offence death
reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ”1450 and again: “Therefore as by the offence
<note type="footnote">1450 Rom. v. 15, 16, 17</note>

<pb n="494"/>
of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one
the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience
many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”1451
And when introducing to the Corinthians his argument about the resurrection he shortly
reveals to them the mystery of the oeconomy, and says: “But now is Christ risen from the
dead and become the first fruits of them which slept. For since by man came death by man
came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be
made alive.”1452 So I have brought you proofs from the divine oracles. Now look at what
belongs to Adam compared with what belongs to Christ, the disease with the remedy, the
wound with the salve, the sin with the wealth of righteousness, the ban with the blessing,
the doom with the delivery, the transgression with the observance, the death with the life,
hell with the kingdom, Adam with Christ, the man with the Man. And yet the Lord Christ
is not only man but eternal God, but the divine Apostle names Him from the nature which
He assumed, because it is in this nature that he compares Him with Adam. The justification,
the struggle, the victory, the death, the resurrection are all of this human nature; it is this
nature which we share with Him; in this nature they who have exercised themselves beforehand
in the citizenship of the kingdom shall reign with Him. Of this nature I spoke, not
dividing the Godhead, but referring to what is proper to the manhood.</p>
<p>Eran.—You have gone through long discussions on this point, and have strengthened
your argument by scriptural testimony, but if the passion was really of the flesh, how is it
that when he praises the divine love to men, the Apostle exclaims, “He that spared not His
own Son but delivered Him up for us all,”1453 what son does he say was delivered up?
Orth.—Watch well your words. There is one Son of God, wherefore He is called only
begotten.</p>
<p>Eran.—If then there is one Son of God, the divine Apostle called him own Son.</p>
<p>Orth.—True.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then he says that He was delivered up.
Orth.—Yes, but not without a body, as we have agreed again and again.</p>
<p>Eran.—It has been agreed again and again that He took body and soul.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the Apostle spoke of what relates to the body.</p>
<p>Eran.—The divide Apostle says distinctly “Who spared not his own Son.”</p>
<p>Orth.—When then you hear God saying to Abraham “Because thou hast not withheld
thy son thy only son,”1454 do you allege that Isaac was slain?</p>
<note type="footnote">1451 Rom. v. 18, 19</note>
<note type="footnote">1452 1 Cor. xv. 20, 21, 22</note>
<note type="footnote">1453 Rom. xiii. 32</note>
<note type="footnote">1454 Gen. xxii. 16</note>

<pb n="495"/>
<p>Eran.—Of course not.</p>
<p>Orth.—And yet God said “Thou hast not withheld,” and the God of all is true.</p>
<p>Eran.—The expression “thou hast not withheld” refers to the readiness of Abraham,
for he was ready to sacrifice the lad, but God prevented it.</p>
<p>Orth.—Well; in the story of Abraham you were not content with the letter, but unfolded
it and made the meaning clear. In precisely the same manner examine the meaning of the
words of the Apostle. You will then see that it was by no means the divine nature which was
not withheld, but the flesh nailed to the Cross. And it is easy to perceive the truth even in
the type. Do you regard Abraham’s sacrifice as a type of the oblation offered on behalf of
the world?</p>
<p>Eran.—Not at all, nor yet can I make words spoken rhetorically in the churches a rule
of faith.</p>
<p>Orth.—You ought by all means to follow teachers of the Church, but, since you improperly
oppose yourself to these, hear the Saviour Himself when addressing the Jews; “Your
Father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad.”1455 Note that the Lord
calls His passion “a day.”</p>
<p>Eran.—I accept the Lord’s testimony and do not doubt the type.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now compare the type with the reality and you will see the impassibility of the
Godhead even in the type. Both in the former and in the latter there is a Father; both in the
former and the latter a well beloved Son, each bearing the material for the sacrifice. The one
bore the wood, the other the cross upon his shoulders. It is said that the top of the hill was
dignified by the sacrifice of both. There is a correspondence moreover between the number
of days and nights and the resurrection which followed, for after Isaac had been slain by his
father’s willing heart, on the third day after the bountiful God had ordered the deed to be
done, he rose to new life at the voice of Him who loves mankind.1456 A lamb was seen caught
in a thicket, furnishing an image of the cross, and slain instead of the lad. Now if this is a
type of the reality, and in the type the only begotten Son did not undergo sacrifice, but a
lamb was substituted and laid upon the altar and completed the mystery of the oblation,
why then in the reality do you hesitate to assign the passion to the flesh, and to proclaim
the impassibility of the Godhead?</p>
<p>Eran.—In your observations upon this type you represent Isaac as living again at the
divine command. There is nothing therefore unseemly if, fitting the reality to the type, we
declare that God the Word suffered and came to life again.</p>
<note type="footnote">1455 John viii. 56</note>
<note type="footnote">1456 The sacrifice of Isaac so far as his father’s part in it is concerned is regarded as having actually taken
place at the moment of his felt willingness to obey. In the interval of the journey to Mount Moriah Isaac is dead
to his father.</note>

<pb n="496"/>
<p>Orth.—I have said again and again that it is quite impossible for the type to match the
archetypal reality in every respect, and this may also be easily understood in the present
instance. Isaac and the lamb, as touching the difference of their natures, suit the image, but
as touching the separation of their divided persons1457 they do so no longer. We preach so
close an union of Godhead and of manhood as to understand one person1458 undivided,
and to acknowledge the same to be both God and man, visible and invisible, circumscribed
and uncircumscribed, and we apply to one of the persons all the attributes which are indicative
alike of Godhead and of manhood. Now since the lamb, an unreasoning being, and
not gifted with the divine image,1459 could not possibly prefigure the restoration to life, the
two divide between them the type of the mystery of the oeconomy, and while one furnishes
the image of death, the other supplies that of the resurrection. We find precisely the same
thing in the Mosaic sacrifices, for in them too may be seen a type outlined in anticipation
of the passion of salvation.</p>
<p>Eran.—What Mosaic sacrifice foreshadows the reality?</p>
<p>Orth.—All the Old Testament, so to say, is a type of the New. It is for this reason that
the divine Apostle plainly says—“the Law having a shadow of good things to come”1460 and
again “now all these things happened unto them for ensamples.”1461 The image of the archetype
is very distinctly exhibited by the lamb slain in Egypt, and by the red heifer burned
without the camp, and moreover referred to by the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where he writes “Wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,
suffered without the gate.”1462</p>
<p>But of this no more for the present. I will however mention the sacrifice in which two
goats were offered, the one being slain, and the other let go.1463 In these two goats there is
an anticipative image of the two natures of the Saviour;—in the one let go, of the impassible
Godhead, in the one slain, of the passible manhood.</p>
<p>Eran.—Do you not think it irreverent to liken the Lord to goats?</p>
<p>Orth.—Which do you think is a fitter object of avoidance and hate, a serpent or a goat?</p>
<note type="footnote">1457 ὑπόστασις</note>
<note type="footnote">1458 πρόσωπον</note>
<note type="footnote">1459 It is to be noted that Theodoret thus apparently regards the divine image as consisting in the intelligence
or λόγος. And in the implication that Isaac had the divine image, he expresses the Scriptural view that this was
marred, not lost, by the fall.</note>

<p>Eran.—A serpent is plainly hateful, for it injures those who come within its reach, and
often hurts people who do it no harm. A goat on the other hand comes, according to the
Law, in the list of animals that are clean and may be eaten.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now hear the Lord likening the passion of salvation to the brazen serpent. He
says: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted
up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.”1464 If a brazen
serpent was a type of the crucified Saviour, of what impropriety are we guilty in comparing
the passion of salvation with the sacrifice of the goats?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because John called the Lord “a lamb,”1465 and Isaiah called Him “lamb” and
“sheep.”1466</p>
<p>Orth.—But the blessed Paul calls Him “sin”1467 and “curse.”1468 As curse therefore He
satisfies the type of the accursed serpent; as sin He explains the figure of the sacrifice of the
goats, for on behalf of sin, in the Law, a goat, and not a lamb, was offered. So the Lord in
the Gospels likened the just to lambs, but sinners to kids;1469 and since He was ordained to
undergo the passion not only on behalf of just men, but also of sinners, He appropriately
foreshadows His own offering through lambs and goats.</p>
<p>Eran.—But the type of the two goats leads us to think of two persons.</p>
<p>Orth.—The passibility of the manhood and the impassibility of the Godhead could not
possibly be prefigured both at once by one goat. The one which was slain could not have
shewn the living nature. So two were taken in order to explain the two natures. The same
lesson may well be learnt from another sacrifice.</p>
<p>Eran.—From which?</p>
<p>Orth.—From that in which the lawgiver bids two pure birds be offered—one to be slain,
and the other, after having been dipped in the blood of the slain, to be let go. Here also we
see a type of the Godhead and of the manhood—of the manhood slain and of the godhead
appropriating the passion.</p>
<p>Eran.—You have given us many types, but I object to enigmas.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet the divine Apostle says that the narratives are types.1470 Hagar is called a
type of the old covenant; Sarah is likened to the heavenly Jerusalem; Ishmael is a type of Israel,

<pb n="498"/>
and Isaac of the new people. So you must accuse the loud trumpet of the Spirit for giving
its enigmas for us all.</p>
<p>Eran.—Though you urge any number of arguments, you will never induce me to divide
the passion. I have heard the voice of the angel saying to Mary and her companions, “Come,
see the place where the Lord lay.”1471</p>
<p>Orth.—This is quite in accordance with our common customs; we speak of the part by
the name which belongs to all the parts. When we go into the churches where are buried
the holy apostles or prophets or martyrs, we ask from time to time, “Who is it who lies in
the shrine?” and those who are able to give us information say in reply, Thomas, it may be,
the Apostle,1472 or John the Baptist,1473 or Stephen the protomartyr,1474 or any other of
the saints, mentioning them by name, though perhaps only a few scanty relics of them lie
here. But no one who hears these names which are common to both body and soul will
imagine that the souls also are shut up in the chests; everybody knows that the chests contain
only the bodies or even small portions of the bodies. The holy angel spoke in precisely the
same manner when he described the body by the name of the person.</p>
<p>Eran.—But how can you prove that the angel spoke to the women about the Lord’s
body?</p>
<p>Orth.—In the first place, the tomb itself suffices to settle the question, for to a tomb is
committed neither soul nor Godhead whose nature is uncircumscribed; tombs are made
for bodies. Furthermore this is plainly taught by the divine Scripture, for so the holy Matthew
narrates the event, “When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathæa named
Joseph who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered, and when Joseph had taken the body, he
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out
in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.”1475 See
how often he mentions the body in order to stop the mouths of them who blaspheme the
Godhead. The same course is pursued by the thrice blessed Mark, whose narrative I will
also quote. “And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the
day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable counsellor, which also waited
for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked

him whether He had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave
the body to Joseph, and he brought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped Him in
the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre,”1476 and so on. Observe with admiration, the harmony
of terms, and how consistently and continuously the word body is introduced. The illustrious
Luke, too, relates just in the same way how Joseph begged the body and after he had received
it treated it with due rites.1477 By the divine John we are told yet more, “Joseph of Arimathæa
being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take
away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of
Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought
a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of
Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre,
wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’
preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.”1478 Observe how often mention is
made of the body; how the Evangelist shows that it was the body which was nailed to the
cross, the body begged by Joseph of Pilate, the body taken down from the tree, the body
wrapped in linen clothes with the myrrh and aloes, and then the name of the person given
to it; and Jesus said to have been laid in a tomb. Thus the angel said, “Come see the place
where the Lord lay,”1479 naming the part by the name of the whole; and we constantly do
just the same. In this place, we say, such an one was buried; not the body of such an one.
Every one in his senses knows that we are speaking of the body, and such a mode of speech
is customary in divine Scripture. Aaron, we read, died and they buried him on Mount
Hor.1480 Samuel died and they buried him at Ramah,1481 and there are many similar instances.
The same use is followed by the divine Apostle when speaking of the death of the
Lord. “I delivered unto you first of all,” he writes, “that which I also received how that Christ
died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again
the third day according to the Scriptures,”1482 and so on.</p>
<p>Eran.—In the passages we have just now read the Apostle does not mention a body, but
Christ the Saviour of us all. You have brought evidence against your own side, and wounded

<p>Orth.—You seem to have very quickly forgotten the long discourse in which I proved
to you over and over again that the body is spoken of by the name of the person. This is
what is now done by the divine Apostle, and it can easily be proved from this very passage.
Now let us look at it. Why did the divine writer write thus to the Corinthians?</p>
<p>Eran.—They had been deceived by some into believing that there is no resurrection.
When the teacher of the world learnt this he furnished them with his arguments about the
resurrection of the bodies.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why then does he introduce the resurrection of the Lord, when he wishes to
prove the resurrection of the bodies?</p>
<p>Eran.—As sufficient to prove the resurrection of us all.</p>
<p>Orth.—In what is His death like the death of the rest; that by His resurrection may be
proved the resurrection of all?</p>
<p>Eran.—The reason of the incarnation, suffering, and death of the only begotten Son of
God, was that He might destroy death. Thus, after rising, by His own resurrection He
preaches the resurrection of all.</p>
<p>Orth.—But who, hearing of a resurrection of God, would ever believe that the resurrection
of all men would be exactly like it? The difference of the natures does not allow of our
believing in the argument of the resurrection. He is God and they are men, and the difference
between God and men is incalculable. They are mortal, and subject to death, like to the grass
and to the flower. He is almighty.</p>
<p>Eran.—But after His incarnation God the Word had a body, and through this He proved
His likeness to men.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; and for this reason the suffering and the death and the resurrection are all
of the body, and in proof of this the divine Apostle in another place promises renewal of
life to all, and to them that believe in the resurrection of their Saviour, yet look upon the
general resurrection of all as fable, he exclaims, “Now if Christ be preached that He rose
from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if
there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen, and if Christ he not risen…your
faith is vain, you are yet in your sins.”1483 And from the past he confirms the future, and
from what is disbelieved he disproves what is believed, for he says, If the one seems impossible
to you, then the other will be false; if the one seems real and true, then let the other in like
manner seem true, for here too a resurrection of the body is preached, and this body is called
the first fruits of those. The resurrection of this body after many arguments he affirms directly,
“But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,
for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead, for as in Adam
all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,”1484 and he does not only confirm the argu-

ment of the resurrection, but also reveals the mystery of the oeconomy. He calls Christ man
that he may prove the remedy to be appropriate to the disease.</p>
<p>Eran.—Then the Christ is only a man.</p>
<p>Orth.—God forbid. On the contrary, we have again and again confessed that He is not
only man but eternal God. But He suffered as man, not as God. And this the divine Apostle
clearly teaches us when he says “For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead.”1485 And in his letter to the Thessalonians, he strengthens his argument
concerning the general resurrection by that of our Saviour in the passage “For if we believe
that Jesus died and rose again, even them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him.”1486</p>
<p>Eran.—The Apostle proves the general resurrection by means of the Lord’s resurrection,
and it is clear that in this case also what died and rose was a body. For he would never have
attempted to prove the general resurrection by its means unless there had been some relation
between the substance of the one and the other. I shall never consent to apply the passion
to the human nature alone. It seems agreeable to my view to say that God the Word died
in the flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—We have frequently shewn that what is naturally immortal can in no way die. If
then He died He was not immortal; and what perils lie in the blasphemy of the words.</p>
<p>Eran.—He is by nature immortal, but He became man and suffered.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore He underwent change, for how otherwise could He being immortal
submit to death? But we have agreed that the substance of the Trinity is immutable. Having
therefore a nature superior to change, He by no means shared death.</p>
<p>Eran.—The divine Peter says “Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh.”1487</p>
<p>Orth.—This agrees with what we have said, for we have learnt the rule of dogmas from
the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Eran.—How then can you deny that God the Word suffered in the flesh?</p>
<p>Orth.—Because we have not found this expression in the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Eran.—But I have just quoted you the utterance of the great Peter.</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem to ignore the distinction of the terms.</p>
<p>Eran.—What terms? Do you not regard the Lord Christ as God the Word?</p>
<note type="footnote">1485 1 Cor. xv. 21</note>
<note type="footnote">1486 1 Thess. iv. 14</note>
<note type="footnote">1487 1 Peter iv. 1</note>

<pb n="502"/>
<p>Orth.—The term Christ in the case of our Lord and Saviour signifies the incarnate Word
the Immanuel, God with us,1488 both God and man, but the term “God the Word” so said
signifies the simple nature before the world, superior to time, and incorporeal. Wherefore
the Holy Ghost that spake through the holy Apostles nowhere attributes passion or death
to this name.</p>
<p>Eran.—If the passion is attributed to the Christ, and God the Word after being made
man was called Christ, I hold that he who states God the Word to have suffered in the flesh
is in no way unreasonable.</p>
<p>Orth.—Hazardous and rash in the extreme is such an attempt. But let us look at the
question in this way. Does the divine Scripture state God the Word to be of God and of the
Father?</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—And it describes the Holy Ghost as being in like manner of God?</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—But it calls God the Word only begotten Son.</p>
<p>Eran.—It does.</p>
<p>Orth.—It nowhere so names the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yet the Holy Ghost also has Its subsistence of the Father and God.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—We grant then that both the Son and the Holy Ghost are both of God the Father;
but would you dare to call the Holy Ghost Son?</p>
<p>Eran.—Certainly not.</p>
<p>Orth.—Why?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because I do not find this term in the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Orth.—Or begotten?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—Wherefore?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because I no more learn this in the divine Scripture.</p>
<p>Orth.—But what name can properly be given to that which is neither begotten nor created?</p>
<p>Eran.—We style it uncreated and unbegotten.</p>
<p>Orth.—And we say that the Holy Ghost is neither created nor begotten.</p>
<p>Eran.—By no means.</p>
<p>Orth.—Would you then dare to call the Holy Ghost unbegotten?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<note type="footnote">1488 Matt. i. 23</note>

<pb n="503"/>
<p>Orth.—But why refuse to call that which is naturally uncreate, but not begotten, unbegotten?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because I have not learnt so from the divine Scripture, and I am greatly afraid
of saying, or using language which Scripture does not use.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then, my good sir, I maintain the same caution in the case of the passion of
salvation; do you too avoid all the divine names which Scripture has avoided in the case of
the passion, and do not attribute the passion to them.</p>
<p>Eran.—What names?</p>
<p>Orth.—The passion is never connected with the name “God.”</p>
<p>Eran.—But even I do not affirm that God the Word suffered apart from a body, but say
that He suffered in flesh.</p>
<p>Orth.—You affirm then a mode of passion, not impassibility. No one would ever say
this even in the case of a human body. For who not altogether out of his senses would say
that the soul of Paul died in flesh? This could never be said even in the case of a great villain;
for the souls even of the wicked are immortal. We say that such or such a murderer has been
slain, but no one would ever say that his soul had been killed in the flesh. But if we describe
the souls of murderers and violators of sepulchres as free from death, far more right is it to
acknowledge as immortal the soul of our Saviour, in that it never tasted sin. If the souls of
them who have most greatly erred have escaped death on account of their nature, how could
that soul, whose nature was immortal and who never received the least taint of sin, have
taken death’s hook?</p>
<p>Eran.—It is quite useless for you to give me all these long arguments. We are agreed
that the soul of the Saviour is immortal.</p>
<p>Orth.—But of what punishment are you not deserving, you who say that the soul, which
is by nature created, is immortal, and are for making the divine substance mortal for the
Word; you who deny that the soul of the Saviour tasted death in the flesh, and dare to
maintain that God the Word, Creator of all things, underwent the passion?</p>
<p>Eran.—We say that He underwent the passion impassibly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what man in his senses would ever put up with such ridiculous riddles?
Who ever heard of an impassible passion, or of an immortal mortality? The impassible has
never undergone passion, and what has undergone passion could not possibly be impassible.
But we hear the exclamation of the divine Paul: “Who only hath immortality dwelling in
the light which no man can approach unto.”1489</p>
<p>Eran.—Why then do we say that the invisible powers too and the souls of men, aye and
the very devils, are immortal?</p>
<note type="footnote">1489 1 Tim. vi. 16</note>

<pb n="504"/>
<p>Orth.—We do say so; that God is absolutely immortal. He is immortal not by partaking
of substance, but in substance; He does not possess an immortality which He has received
of another. It is He Himself who has bestowed their immortality on the angels and on them
that thou hast just now mentioned. How, moreover, when the divine Paul styles Him immortal
and says that He only hath immortality, can you attribute to Him the passion of
death?</p>
<p>Eran.—We say that He tasted death after the incarnation.</p>
<p>Orth.—But over and over again we have confessed Him immutable. If being previously
immortal He afterwards underwent death through the flesh, a change having preceded His
undergoing death; if His life left Him for three days and three nights, how do such statements
fall short of the most extreme impiety? For I think that not even they that are struggling
against impiety can venture to let such words fall from their lips without peril.</p>
<p>Eran.—Cease from charging us with impiety. Even we say that not the divine nature
suffered but the human; but we do say that the divine shared with the body in suffering.</p>
<p>Orth.—What can you mean by sharing in suffering? Do you mean that when the nails
were driven into the body the divine nature felt the sense of pain?</p>
<p>Eran.—I do.</p>
<p>Orth.—Both now and in our former investigations we have shewn that the soul does
not share all the faculties of the body but that the body while it receives vital force has the
sense of suffering through the soul. And even supposing us to grant that the soul shares in
pain with the body we shall none the less find the divine nature to be impassible, for it was
not united to the body instead of a soul. Or do you not acknowledge that He assumed a
soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—I have often acknowledged it.</p>
<p>Orth.—And that He assumed a reasonable Soul?
Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—If then together with the body He assumed the soul, and we grant that the soul
shared in suffering with the body, then the soul, not the Godhead, shared the passion with
the body; it shared the passion, receiving pangs by means of the body. But possibly somebody
might agree to the soul sharing suffering with the body, but might deny its sharing death,
because of its having an immortal nature. On this account the Lord said “Fear not them
which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul.”1490 If then we deny that the soul of the
Saviour shared death with the body, how could any one accept the blasphemy you and your
friends presumptuously promulgate when you dare to say that the divine nature participated
<note type="footnote">1490 Matt. x. 28</note>

<pb n="505"/>
in death? This is the more inexcusable when the Lord points out at one time that the body1491
was being offered, at another that the soul was being troubled.1492</p>
<p>Eran.—And where doth the Lord shew that the body was being offered? Or are you
going to bring me once more that well worn passage “Destroy this temple and in three days
I will raise it up”?1493 Or with your conceited self-sufficiency are you going to quote me the
words of the Evangelist? “But He spake of the temple of his body. When therefore He was
risen from the dead His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them and they
believed the Scripture and the words which He had said.”1494</p>
<p>Orth.—If you have such a detestation of the divine words which preach the mystery of
the incarnation, why, like Marcion and Valentinus and Manes, do you not destroy texts of
this kind? For this is what they have done. But if this seems to you rash and impious, do not
turn the Lord’s words into ridicule, but rather follow the Apostles in their belief after the
resurrection that the Godhead raised again the temple which the Jews had destroyed.
Eran.—If you have any good evidence to adduce, give over gibing and fulfil your
promise.</p>
<p>Orth.—Remember specially those words of the gospels in which the Lord made a comparison
between manna and the true bread.</p>
<p>Eran.—I remember.</p>
<p>Orth.—In that passage after speaking at some length about the bread of life, he added,
“The bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.”1495 In these
words may be understood alike the bounty of the Godhead and the boon of the flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—One quotation is not enough to settle the question.</p>
<p>Orth.—The Ethiopian eunuch had not read much of the Bible, but when he had found
one witness from the prophets he was guided by it to salvation. But not all Apostles and
prophets and all the preachers of the truth who have lived since then are enough to convince
you. Nevertheless I will bring you some further testimony about the Lord’s body. You cannot
but know that passage in the Gospel history where, after eating the passover with His disciples,
our Lord pointed to the death of the typical lamb and taught what body corresponded
with that shadow.1496</p>

<p>Orth.—Remember then what it was which our Lord took and broke, and what He called
it when He had taken it.</p>
<p>Eran.—I will answer in mystic language for the sake of the uninitiated. After taking and
breaking it and giving it to His disciples He said, “This is my body which was given for
you”1497 or according to the apostle “broken”1498 and again, “This is my blood of the New
Testament which is shed for many.”1499
Orth.—Then when exhibiting the type of the passion He did not mention the Godhead?</p>
<p>Eran.—No.</p>
<p>Orth.—But He did mention the body and blood.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the body was nailed to the Cross?</p>
<p>Eran.—Even so.</p>
<p>Orth.—Come, then; look at this. When after the resurrection the doors were shut and
the Lord came to the holy disciples and beheld them affrighted, what means did He use to
destroy their fear and instead of fear to infuse faith?</p>
<p>Eran.—He said to them “Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself; handle me
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.”1500</p>
<p>Orth.—So when they disbelieved He shewed them the body?</p>
<p>Eran.—He did.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore the body rose?</p>
<p>Eran.—Clearly.</p>
<p>Orth.—And I suppose what rose was what had died?</p>
<p>Eran.—Even so.</p>
<p>Orth.—And what had died was what was nailed to the cross?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of necessity.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then according to your own argument the body suffered?</p>

lover of the truth.</p>

<p>Eran.—He quoted the divine David, and said that he had received promises from God
that the Lord Christ should be born of the fruit of his loins and that in trust in these promises
he prophetically foresaw His resurrection, and plainly said that His soul was not left in
Hades and that His flesh did not see corruption.1501
Orth.—His resurrection therefore is of these.</p>
<p>Eran.—How can any one in his senses say that there is a resurrection of the soul which
never died?</p>
<p>Orth.—How comes it that you who attribute the passion, the death and the resurrection
to the immutable and uncircumscribed Godhead have suddenly appeared before us in your
right mind and now object to connecting the word resurrection with the soul?</p>
<p>Eran.—Because the word resurrection is applicable to what has fallen.</p>
<p>Orth.—But the body does not obtain resurrection apart from a soul, but being renewed
by the divine will, and conjoined with its yokefellow, it receives life. Was it not thus that the
Lord raised Lazarus?</p>
<p>Eran.—It is plain that not the body alone rises.</p>
<p>Orth.—This is more distinctly taught by the divine Ezekiel,1502 for he points out how
the Lord commanded the bones to come together, and how all of them were duly fitted together,
and how He made sinews and veins and arteries grow with all the flesh pertaining
to them and the skin that clothes them all, and then ordered the souls to come back to their
own bodies.</p>
<p>Eran.—This is true.</p>
<p>Orth.—But the Lord’s body did not undergo this corruption, but remained unimpaired,
and on the third day recovered its own soul.</p>
<p>Eran.—Agreed.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then the death was of what had suffered?</p>
<p>Eran.—Without question.</p>
<p>Orth.—And when the great Peter mentioned the resurrection, and the divine David too,
they said that His soul was not left in Hell, but that His body did not undergo corruption?</p>
<p>Eran.—They did.</p>

from the soul?</p>

<p>Eran.—What do you say to those words of the Apostle “Had they known it they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory”?1503 in this passage he mentions neither body nor soul.

invention for decrying the Godhead of the Word—but must attribute the passion
to the bare Godhead of the Word.</p>
<p>Eran.—No; no. He suffered in the flesh, but His incorporeal nature was not capable of
suffering by itself.</p>
<p>Orth.—Ah! but nothing must be added to the Apostle’s words.</p>
<p>Eran.—When we know the Apostle’s meaning there is nothing absurd in adding what
is left out.</p>

written and reveal the hidden meaning is holy and pious.</p>

of the Scriptures.</p>

or of His manhood?</p>

do the same thing now. Tell me; do you say that God the Word was only begotten Son?</p>

<p>Eran.—Of course not, for if He had had a brother He would not be called the only begotten.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then they were wrong in calling James the brother of the Lord. For the Lord
was only begotten, and the only begotten cannot have a brother.</p>
<p>Eran.—No, but the Lord is not incorporeal and the proclaimers of the truth are referring
only to what touches the godhead.</p>

<p>Eran.—It was not possible to explain the kinship in any other way.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then do not find fault with those who cannot explain similar difficulties in any
other way.</p>
<p>Eran.—Now you are getting the argument off the track because you want to shirk the
question.</p>
<p>Orth.—Not at all, my friend. That will be settled too by the points we have investigated.
Now look; when you were reminded of James the brother of the Lord, you said that the relationship
referred not to the Godhead but to the flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—I did.</p>
<p>Orth.—Well, now that you are told of the passion of the cross, refer this too to the flesh.</p>
<p>Eran.—The Apostle called the crucified “Lord of Glory,”1505 and the same Apostle called
the Lord “brother of James.”</p>
<p>Orth.—And it is the same Lord in both cases. If then you are right in referring the relationship
to the flesh you must also refer the passion to the flesh, for it is perfectly ridiculous
to regard the relationship without distinction and to refer the passion to Christ without
distinction.</p>
<p>Eran.—I follow the Apostle who calls the crucified “Lord of glory.”</p>
<p>Orth.—I follow too, and believe that He was “Lord of glory.” For the body which was
nailed to the wood was not that of any common man but of the Lord of glory. But we must
acknowledge that the union makes the names common. Once more: do you say that the
flesh of the Lord came down from heaven?</p>
<p>Eran.—Of course not.</p>
<p>Orth.—But was formed in the Virgin’s womb?</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes.</p>
<note type="footnote">1505 1 Cor. ii. 8</note>

<pb n="510"/>
<p>Orth.—How, then, does the Lord say “If ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where
He was before,”1506 and again “No man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down
from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven?”1507</p>
<p>Eran.—He is speaking not of the flesh, but of the Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; but the Godhead is of the God and Father. How then does He call him Son
of man?</p>
<p>Eran.—The peculiar properties of the natures are shared by the person, for on account
of the union the same being is both Son of man and Son of God, everlasting and of time,
Son of David and Lord of David, and so on with the rest.
Orth.—Very right. But it is also important to recognise the fact that no confusion of
natures results from both having one name. Wherefore we are endeavouring to distinguish
how the same being is Son of God and also Son of man, and how He is “the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever,”1508 and by the reverent distinction of terms we find that the contradictions
are in agreement.</p>
<p>Eran.—You are right.</p>
<p>Orth.—You say that the divine nature came down from heaven and that in consequence
of the union it was called the Son of man. Thus it behoves us to say that the flesh was nailed
to the tree, but to hold that the divine nature even on the cross and in the tomb was inseparable
from this flesh, though from it it derived no sense of suffering, since the divine nature
is naturally incapable of undergoing both suffering and death and its substance is immortal
and impassible. It is in this sense that the crucified is styled Lord of Glory, by attribution of
the title of the impassible nature to the passible, since, as we know, a body is described as
belonging to this latter.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the matter thus. The words of the divine Apostle are “Had they
known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.”1509 They crucified the nature
which they knew, not that of which they were wholly ignorant: had they known that of
which they were ignorant they would not have crucified that which they knew: they crucified
the human because they were ignorant of the divine. Have you forgotten their own words.
“For a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man,
makest thyself God.”1510 These words are a plain proof that they recognised the nature they
saw, while of the invisible they were wholly ignorant: had they known that nature they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>

<p>Eran.—That is very probable, but the exposition of the faith laid down by the Fathers
in council at Nicæa says that the only begotten Himself, very God, of one substance with
the Father, suffered and was crucified.</p>
<p>Orth.—You seem to forget what we have agreed on again and again.</p>
<p>Eran.—What do you mean?</p>
<p>Orth.—I mean that after the union the holy Scripture applies to one person terms both
of exaltation and of humiliation. But possibly you are also ignorant that the illustrious
Fathers first mentioned His taking flesh and being made man, and then afterwards added
that He suffered and was crucified, and thus spoke of the passion after they had set forth
the nature capable of passion.</p>
<p>Eran.—The Fathers said that the Son of God, Light of Light, of the substance of the
Father, suffered and was crucified.</p>
<p>Orth.—I have observed more than once that both the Divine and the human are ascribed
to the one Person. It is in accordance with this position that the thrice blessed Fathers, after
teaching how we should believe in the Father, and then passing on to the person of the Son,
did not immediately add “and in the Son of God,” although it would have very naturally
followed that after defining what touches God the Father they should straightway have introduced
the name of Son. But their object was to give us at one and the same time instruction
on the theology and on the oeconomy,1511 lest there should be supposed to be any distinction
between the Person of the Godhead and the Person of the Manhood. On this account they
added to their statement concerning the Father that we must believe also in our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. Now after the incarnation God the Word is called Christ, for this
name includes alike all that is proper to the Godhead and to the manhood. We recognise
nevertheless that some properties belong to the one nature and some to the others, and this
may at once be understood from the actual terms of the Creed. For tell me: to what do you
apply the phrase “of the substance of the Father”? to the Godhead, or to the nature that was
fashioned of the seed of David?</p>
<p>Eran.—To the Godhead, as is plain.</p>
<p>Orth.—And the clause “Very God of very God”; to which do you hold this belongs, to
the Godhead or to the manhood?</p>
<p>Eran.—To the Godhead.</p>
<p>Orth.—Therefore neither the flesh nor the soul is of one substance with the Father, for
they are created, but the Godhead which formed all things.</p>
<p>Eran.—True.</p>
<p>Orth.—Very well, then. And when we are told of passion and of the cross we must recognise
the nature which submitted to the passion; we must avoid attributing it to the im-
<note type="footnote">1511 Vide note on page 72.</note>

<pb n="512"/>
passible, and must attribute it to that nature which was assumed for the distinct purpose of
suffering. The acknowledgment on the part of the most excellent Fathers that the divine
nature was impassible; and their attribution of the passion to the flesh is proved by the
conclusion of the creed, which runs “But they who state there was a time when He was not,
and before He was begotten He was not, and He was made out of the non-existent, or who
allege that the Son of God was of another essence or substance mutable or variable, these
the holy catholic and apostolic Church anathematizes.” See then what penalties are denounced
against them that attribute the passion to the divine nature.1512</p>
<p>Eran.—They are speaking in this place of mutation and variation.</p>
<p>Orth.—But what is the passion but mutation and variation? For if, being impassible
before His incarnation, He suffered after His incarnation, He assuredly suffered by undergoing
mutation; and if being immortal before He became man, He tasted death, as you say,
after being made man, He underwent a complete alteration by being made mortal after being
immortal. But expressions of this kind, and their authors with them, have all been expelled
by the illustrious Fathers from the bounds of the Church, and cut off like rotten limbs from
the sound body. We therefore exhort you to fear the punishment and abhor the blasphemy.</p>
<p>Now I will show you that in their own writings the holy Fathers have held the opinions
we have expressed. Of the witnesses I shall bring forward some took part in that great
Council; some flourished in the Church after their time; some illuminated the world long
before. But their harmony is broken neither by difference of periods nor by diversity of
language; like the harp their strings are several and separate but like the harp they make one
harmonious music.</p>
<p>Eran.—I was anxious for and shall be delighted at such citations. Instruction of this
kind cannot be gainsaid, and is most useful.</p>
<p>Orth.—Now; open your ears and receive the streams that flow from the spiritual springs.</p>

corpus suum illum fecit. Hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est figura mei corporis. Figura autem non fuisset,
nisi veritatis esset corpus, ceterum vacua res quod est phantasma, figuram capere non posset.’ The Eucharist implies
the reality of Christ’s flesh. To those who deny this reality it has no meaning at all; to them Christ’s words of

rose from the dead,’1514 he adds, giving the reason of His incarnation, ‘For since by man
came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead,’1515 and on all occasions in reference
to the passion, the manhood and the dissolution of the Lord, he uses the name of
Christ as in the text, ‘Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died,’1516 and again,
‘But now in Christ ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ,’1517
and again, ‘Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us:

“For as He was Man that He might be tempted, so was He Word that He might be

Of the same from the same discourse:—</p>
<p>“And the body being, humanly speaking, a corpse, has in itself great power of life, for
there flowed from it what does not flow from dead bodies—blood and water,—that we might
know what vital force lies in the indwelling power in the body, so that it is a corpse evidently
unlike others, and is able to pour forth for us causes of life.”1522</p>

<p>“Their impious calumny can be refuted in a few words; they may be right, unless He

of the Father, nor by the Wisdom which contains all created things, but were uttered by the
man who was compacted of various limbs, who had risen from the dead, who had not yet
after His death gone back to the Father, and was reserving for Himself the first fruits of His
progress.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“As he writes he expressly describes the man who was crucified as Lord of Glory, declaring
Him to be Lord and Christ, just as the Apostles with one voice when speaking to Israel
in the flesh say ‘Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that
same Jesus, Whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.’1526 He so made Jesus Christ
who suffered. He did not so make the Wisdom nor yet the Word who has the might of
dominion from the beginning, but Him who was lifted up on high and stretched out His
hands upon the Cross.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“For if He is incorporeal and not subject to manual contact, nor apprehended by eyes
of flesh, He undergoes no wound, He is not nailed by nails, He has no part in death, He is
not hidden in the ground, He is not shut in a grave, He does not rise from a tomb.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same book:—</p>
<p>“‘No man taketh it from me.<gap reason="omitted"/>I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it
again.’1527 If as God He had the double power, He yet yielded to them who were striving of
evil counsel to destroy the temple, but by His resurrection He restored it in greater splendour.
It is proved by incontrovertible evidence that He of Himself rose and renewed His own
house, and the great work of the Son is to be ascribed to the divine Father; for the Son does
not work without the Father, as is declared in the unimpeachable utterances of the holy
Scriptures. Wherefore at one time the divine Parent is described as having raised the Christ
from the dead, at another time the Son promises to raise His own temple. If then from what
has previously been laid down the divine spirit of the Christ is proved to be impassible, in
vain do the accursed assail the apostolic definitions. If Paul says that the Lord of Glory was
crucified, clearly referring to the manhood, we must not on this account refer suffering to
the divine. Why then do they put these two things together, saying that the Christ was crucified
from infirmity?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“But had it been becoming to attribute to Him any kind of infirmity, any one might
have said that it was natural to attach these qualities to the manhood, though not to the
fulness of the Godhead, or to the dignity of the highest wisdom, or to Him who according
to Paul is described as God over all.”1528</p>

<p>Of the same from the same book:—</p>
<p>“This then is the manner of the infirmity according to which He is described by Paul
as coming to death, for the man lives by God’s power when plainly associated with God’s
spirit, since from the preceding statements He who is believed to be in Him is proved to be
also the power of the Most High.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same:—</p>
<p>“As by entering the Virgin’s womb He did not lessen His power, so neither by the
fastening of His body to the wood of the cross is His spirit defiled. For when the body was
crucified on high the divine Spirit of wisdom dwelt even within the body, trod in heavenly
places, filled all the earth, reigned over the depths, visited and judged the soul of every man,
and continued to do all that God continually does, for the wisdom that is on high is not
prisoned and contained within bodily matter, just as moist and dry material are contained
within their vessels and are contained by but do not contain them. But this wisdom, being
a divine and ineffable power, embraces and confirms alike all that is within and all that is
without the temple, and thence proceeding beyond comprehends and sways at once all
matter.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“But if the sun being a visible body, apprehended by the senses, endures everywhere
such adverse influences without changing its order, or feeling any blow, be it small or great;
can we suppose the incorporeal Wisdom to be defiled and to change its nature because its
temple is nailed to the cross or destroyed or wounded or corrupted? The temple suffers, but
the substance abides without spot, and preserves its entire dignity without defilement.”
Of the same from his work on the titles of the Psalms of Degrees:—</p>
<p>“The Father who is perfect, infinite, incomprehensible, and is incapable alike of adornment
or disfigurement, receives no acquired glory; nor yet does His Word, who is God begotten
of Him, through whom are angels and heaven and earth’s boundless bulk and all the
form and matter of created things; but the man Christ raised from the dead is exalted and
glorified to the open discomfiture of His foes.”
Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“They however who have lifted up hatred against Him, though they be fenced round
with the forces of His foes, are scattered abroad, while the God and Word gloriously raised
His own temple.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the 92nd Psalm:—</p>
<p>“Moreover the prophet Isaiah following the tracks of His sufferings, among other utterances
exclaims with a mighty voice ‘And we saw Him and He had no form nor beauty. His
form was dishonoured and rejected among the sons of men,’1529 thus distinctly showing
<note type="footnote">1529 Isaiah liii. 2, 3. Sept.</note>

that the marks of indignity and the sufferings must be applied to the human but not to the
divine. And immediately afterwards he adds ‘Being a man under stroke, and able to bear
infirmity.’1530 He it is who after suffering outrage was seen to have no form or comeliness,
then again was changed and clothed with beauty, for the God dwelling in Him was not led
like a lamb to death and slaughtered like a sheep, for His nature is invisible.”</p>

<p>From his letter to Epictetus:—</p>
<p>“Whoever reached such a pitch of impiety as to think and say that the Godhead itself
of one substance with the Father was circumcised, and from perfect became imperfect; and
to deny that what was crucified on the tree was the body, asserting it on the contrary to be
the very creative substance of wisdom?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same treatise:—</p>
<p>“The Word associated with Himself and brought upon Himself what the humanity of
the Word suffered, that we might be able to share in the Godhead of the Word. And marvellous
it was that the sufferer and He who did not suffer were the same; sufferer in that His
own body suffered and He was in it while suffering, but not suffering because the Word,
being by nature God, was impassible. And He Himself the incorporeal was in the passible
body, and the body contained in itself the impassible Word, destroying the infirmities of
His body.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same letter:—</p>
<p>“For being God and Lord of Glory, He was in the body ingloriously crucified; but the
body suffered when smitten on the tree, and water and blood flowed from its side; but being
temple of the Word, it was full of the Godhead. Wherefore when the sun saw its Creator
suffering in His outraged body, it drew in its rays, and darkened the earth. And that very
body with a mortal nature rose superior to its own nature, on account of the Word within
it, and is no longer touched by its natural corruption, but clothed with the superhuman
Word, became incorruptible.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his greater discourse on the Faith:—</p>

we, interprets and say, ‘and when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him they took
Him down from the tree and laid Him in a sepulchre, but God raised Him from the dead.’1531
Now the dead body of Jesus which was taken down from the tree, which had been laid in a
sepulchre, and entombed by Joseph of Arimathæa, is the very body which the Word raised,
saying, ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’1532 It is He who quickens

all the dead, and quickened the man Christ Jesus, born of Mary, whom He assumed. For if
while on the cross1533 He raised corpses of the saints that had previously undergone dissolution,
much more can God the everliving Word raise the body, which He wore, as says Paul,
‘For the word of God is quick and powerful.’”1534</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Life then does not die, but quickens the dead; for as the light is not injured in a dark
place, so life cannot suffer when it has visited a mortal nature, for the Godhead of the Word
is immutable and invariable as the Lord says in the prophecy about Himself ‘I am the Lord
I change not.’”1535</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Living He cannot die but on the contrary quickens the dead. He is therefore, by the
Godhead derived from the Father, a fount of light; but He that died, or rather rose from the
dead, our intercessor, who was born of the Virgin Mary, whom the Godhead of the Word
assumed for our sake, is man.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“It came to pass that Lazarus fell sick and died; but the divine Man did not fall sick nor
against His own will did He die, but of His own accord came to the dispensation of death,
being strengthened by God the Word who dwelt within Him, and who said ‘No man taketh
it from me but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take
it again.’1536 The Godhead then which lays down and takes the life of man which He wore
is of the Son, for in its completeness He assumed the manhood, in order that in its completeness
He might quicken it, and, with it, the dead.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse against the Arians:—</p>
<p>“When therefore the blessed Paul says the Father ‘raised’ the Son ‘from the dead’1537
John tells us that Jesus said ‘Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up<gap reason="omitted"/>but He
spake’ of His own ‘body.’1538 So it is clear to them that take heed that at the raising of the
body the Son is said by Paul to have been raised from the dead, for he refers what concerns
the body to the Son’s person, and just so when he says ‘the Father gave life to the Son’1539

it must be understood that the life was given to the Flesh. For if He Himself is life how can
the life receive life?”</p>
<p>Of the same from his work on the Incarnation:—</p>
<p>“For when the Word was conscious that in no other way could the ruin of men be undone
save by death to the uttermost, and it was impossible that the Word who is immortal and
Son of the Father should die, to effect His end He assumes a body capable of death, that this
body, being united to the Word, who is over all, might, in the stead of all, become subject
to death, and because of the indwelling Word might remain incorruptible, and so by the
grace of the resurrection corruption for the future might lose its power over men. Thus offering
to death, as a sacrifice and victim free from every spot, the body which He had assumed,
by His corresponding offering He straightway destroyed death’s power over all His kind;
for being the Word of God above and beyond all men, He rightly offered and paid His own
temple and bodily instrument, as a ransom for all souls due to death. And thus by means
of the like (body) being associated with all men, the incorruptible Son of God rightly clothed
all men with incorruption by the promise of the resurrection, for the corruption inherent
in death no longer has any place with men, for the sake of the Word who dwelt in them by
the means of the one body.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Wherefore, after His divine manifestations in His works, now also on behalf of all He
offered sacrifice, yielding to death His own temple instead of all, that He might make all
men irresponsible and free from the ancient transgression, and, exhibiting His own body
as incorruptible firstfruits of the resurrection of mankind, might shew Himself stronger
than death. For the body, as having a common substance—for it was a human body, although
by a new miracle its constitution was of the Virgin alone—being mortal, died after the example
of its like; but by the descent of the Word into it no longer suffered corruption, according
to its own nature, but, on account of God the Word who dwelt within it, was delivered
from corruption.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Whence, as I have said, since it was not possible for the Word being immortal to die,
He took upon Himself a body capable of death, in order that He might offer this same body
for all, and He Himself in His suffering on behalf of all through His descent into this body
might ‘destroy Him that hath the power of death.’”1540</p>

incorruption through the Word that dwelt within it. For when the body died the Word was
not injured; but He was Himself impassible, incorruptible, and immortal, as being God’s

<p>Testimony of the holy Ambrosius, bishop of Milan.</p>
<p>From his book on the Catholic faith:—</p>
<p>“There are some men who have reached such a pitch of impiety as to think that the
Godhead of the Lord was circumcised, and from perfect was made imperfect; and that the
divine substance, Creator of all things, and not the flesh, was on the tree.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“The flesh suffered; but the Godhead is free from death. He yielded His body to suffer
according to the law of human nature. For how can God die, when the soul cannot die?
‘Fear not,’ He says, ‘them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul.’1544 If then
the soul cannot be slain how can the Godhead be made subject to death?”</p>
<p>Testimony of the holy Basilius, bishop of Cæsarea:—</p>
<p>“It is perfectly well known to every one who has the least acquaintance with the meaning
of the words of the Apostle that he is not delivering to us a mode of theology but is explaining
the reasons of the oeconomy,1545 for he says ‘God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have
crucified both Lord and Christ.’1546 Thus he is plainly directing his argument to His human
and visible nature.”</p>

<p>“I will no longer call this serious; it is indeed saddest of all that the only begotten God
Himself, Judge of all who exist, the Prince of Life, the Destroyer of Death, is made by him
mortal and alleged to receive suffering in His own Godhead. He represents the Godhead to
have shared with the body in the dissolution of that three days death of the body, and so
after the death to have been again raised by the Father.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his former exposition to Cledonius:—</p>
<p>“It is the contention of the Arians that the manhood was without a soul, that they may
refer the passion to the Godhead and represent the same power as both moving the body
and suffering.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse about the Son:—</p>
<p>“It remained for us to treat of what was commanded Him and of His keeping the commandments
and doing all things pleasing to Him; and further of His perfection, exaltation,
and learning obedience by all that He suffered,1547 His priesthood, His offering, His betrayal,
His entreaty to Him that hath power to save Him from death, His agony, His bloody sweat,
His prayer and similar manifestations, were it not clear to all that all these expressions in
connexion with His Passion in no way signify the nature which was immutable and above
suffering.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his Easter Discourse (Or. ii.):—</p>
<p>“‘Who is this that cometh from Edom?’1548 and from the earth, and how can the garments
of the bloodless and bodiless be red as of one that treadeth in the wine-fat? Urge in
reply the beauty of the garment of the body which suffered and was made beautiful in suffering,
and was made splendid by the Godhead, than which nothing is lovelier nor more
fair.”</p>
<p>Testimony of Gregory, bishop of Nyssa.</p>
<p>From his catechetical oration:—</p>
<p>“And this is the mystery of the dispensation of God concerning the manhood and of
the resurrection from the dead, not to prevent the soul from being separated from the body
by death according to the necessary law of human nature, and to bring them together again
through the resurrection.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“The flesh which received the Godhead, and which through the resurrection was exalted
with the Godhead, is not formed of another material, but of ours; so, just as in the case of
our own body, the operation of one of the senses moves to general sensation the whole man
united to that part, in like manner just as though all nature were one single animal, the resurrection
of the part pervades the whole, being conveyed from the part to the whole by

that the upright stoops to the fallen to raise up him that lies low?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“It would be natural also in this part not to heed the one and neglect the other; but in
the immortal to behold the human, and to be curiously exact about the diviner quality in
the manhood.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his work against Eunomius:—</p>
<p>“’Tis not the human nature which raises Lazarus to life. ’Tis not the impassible power
which sheds tears over the dead. The tear belongs to the man; the life comes from the very
life. The thousands are not fed by human poverty; omnipotence does not hasten to the fig
tree. Who was weary in the way, and who by His word sustains all the world without being
weary? What is the brightness of His glory, what was pierced by the nails? What form is
smitten in the passion, what is glorified for everlasting? The answer is plain and needs no
interpretation.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same treatise:—</p>
<p>“He blames them that refer the passion to the human nature. He wishes himself wholly
to subject the Godhead itself to the passion, for the proposition being twofold and doubtful,
whether the divinity or the humanity was concerned in the passion, the denial of the one
becomes the positive condemnation of the other. While therefore they blame them who see
the passion in the humanity, they will bestow unqualified praise on them that maintain the
Divinity of the Son of God to be passible. But the point established by these means becomes
a confirmation of their own absurdity of doctrine; for if, as they allege, the Godhead of the
Son suffers while that of the Father in accordance with its substance is conserved in complete
impassibility, it follows that the impassible nature is at variance with the nature which sustains
suffering.”</p>
<p>The testimony of the holy Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.</p>
<p>From his discourse on the text “Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word
and believeth on Him that sent me hath everlasting life”:1549—</p>
<p>“Whose then are the sufferings? Of the flesh. Therefore if you give to the flesh the suffering,
give it also the lowly words; and ascribe the exalted words to Him to Whom you assign
the miracles. For the God when He is in the act of working wonders naturally speaks in high
and lofty language worthy of His works and the man when He is suffering fitly utters lowly
words corresponding with His sufferings.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse on “My Father is greater than I”:1550—</p>
<note type="footnote">1549 John v. 24</note>
<note type="footnote">1550 John xiv. 28</note>

<pb n="523"/>
<p>“But when you give the sufferings to the flesh and the miracles to God, you must of
necessity, though unwillingly, give the lowly words to the man born of Mary, and the high
and lofty words becoming God, to the Word who existed in the beginning. The reason why
I utter sometimes lofty words and sometimes lowly is that by the lofty I may show the nobility
of the indwelling Word, and by the lowly make known the infirmity of the lowly flesh. So
at one time I call myself equal to the Father and at another I call the Father greater; and in
this I am not inconsistent with myself, but I shew that I am God and man; God by the lofty
and man by the lowly. And if you wish to know in what sense my Father is greater than I,
I spoke in the flesh and not in the person of the Godhead.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse on “If it be possible let this cup pass from me”:1551—</p>
<p>“Ascribe not then the sufferings of the flesh to the impassible God, for I, O heretic, am
God, and man; God, as the miracles prove; man as is shewn by the sufferings. Since then I
am God and man, tell me, who was it who suffered? If God suffered, you have spoken blasphemy;
but if the flesh suffered, why do you not attribute the passion to Him to whom you
ascribe the dread? For while one is suffering another feels on dread; while man is being
crucified God is not troubled.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse against the Arians:—</p>
<p>“And not to prolong what I am saying, I will shortly ask you, O heretic, did He who was
begotten of God before the ages suffer, or Jesus who was born of David in the last days? If
the Godhead suffered, thou hast spoken blasphemy; if, as the truth is, the manhood suffered,
for what reason do you hesitate to attribute the passion to man?”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse concerning the Son:—</p>
<p>“Peter said, ‘God hath made this Jesus both Lord and Christ’1552 and said too, ‘this Jesus
whom ye crucified God hath raised up.’1553 Now it was the manhood, not the Godhead,
which became a corpse, and He who raised it was the Word, the power of God, who said in
the Gospel, ‘Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.’1554 So when it is said
that God hath made Him who became a corpse and rose from the dead both Lord and Christ,
what is meant is the flesh, and not the Godhead of the Son.”</p>
<p>Of the same from his discourse on “The Son can do nothing of Himself”:1555—</p>
<p>“For He had not such a nature as that His life could be held by corruption, since His
Godhead was not forcibly reduced to suffering. For how could it? But the manhood was
renewed in incorruption. So he says ‘For this mortal must put on immortality and this cor-

On Easter Day:—</p>
<p>“Wherefore also the cross is boldly preached by us, and the Lord’s death confessed
among us, though in nothing did the Godhead suffer, for the divine is impassible, but the
dispensation was fulfilled by the body.”</p>
<p>Of the same on Judas the traitor:—</p>
<p>“When therefore you hear of the Lord being betrayed, do not degrade the divine dignity
to insignificance, nor attribute to divine power the sufferings of the body. For the divine is
impassible and invariable. For if through His love to mankind He took on Him the form of
a servant, He underwent no change in nature. But being what He ever was, he yielded the
divine1557 body to experience death.”</p>
<p>Testimony of Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria.
From his Heortastic Volume:—</p>
<p>“Of unreasoning beings the souls are not taken and replaced: they share in the corruption
of the bodies, and are dissolved into dust. But after the Saviour at the time of the cross had
taken the soul from His own body, He restored it to the body again when He rose from the
dead. To assure us of this He uttered the words of the psalmist, the predictive exclamation,
‘Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hell nor suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.’”1558</p>
<p>Testimony of the blessed Gelasius, bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine:—</p>
<p>“He was bound, He was wounded, He was crucified, He was handled, He was marked
with scars, He received a lance’s wound, and all these indignities were undergone by the
body born of Mary, while that which was begotten from the Father before the ages none
was able to harm, for the Word had no such nature. For how can any one constrain Godhead?
How wound it? How make red with blood the incorporeal nature? How surround it with
grave bands? Grant now what you cannot contravene and, constrained by invincible reason,
honour Godhead.”</p>

<p>“‘What sign shewest Thou unto us seeing that Thou doest these things?’1560 What then
does He reply Himself? ‘Destroy this temple,’ He says, ‘and in three days I will raise it up,’1561
speaking of His own body, but they did not understand Him.”</p>
<p>And a little further on:—</p>
<p>“Why does not the evangelist pass this by? Why did he add the correction, ‘But He spake
of the temple of his body’?1562 for He did not say destroy this ‘body,’ but ‘temple’ that He
might shew the indwelling God. Destroy this temple which is far more excellent than that
of the Jews. The Jewish temple contained the Law; this temple contains the Lawgiver; the
former the letter that killeth; the latter the spirit that giveth life.”1563</p>
<p>Of the same from the discourse “That what was spoken and done in humility was not
so done and spoken on account of infirmity of power but different dispensations”:—</p>
<p>“How then does He say ‘If it be possible’?1564 He is pointing out to us the infirmity of
the human nature, which did not choose to be torn away from this present life, but stepped
back and shrank on account of the love implanted in it by God in the beginning for the
present life. If then when the Lord Himself so often spoke in such terms, some have dared
to say that He did not take flesh, what would they have said if none of these words had been
spoken by Him?”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“Observe how they spoke of His former age. Ask the heretic the question Does God
dread? Does He draw back? Does He shrink? Does He sorrow? and if he says yes, stand off
from him for the future, rank him down below with the devil, aye lower even than the devil,
for even the devil will not dare to say this. But, should he say that each of these things is
unworthy of God, reply—neither does God pray; for apart from these it will be yet another
absurdity should the words be the words of God, for the words indicate not only an agony,
but also two wills; one of the Son and another of the Father, opposed to one another. For
the words ‘Not as I will, but as Thou wilt,’ are the words of one indicating this.”</p>
<p>Of the same from the same work:—</p>
<p>“For if this be spoken of the Godhead there arises a certain contradiction, and many
absurdities are thereby produced. If on the contrary it be spoken of the flesh, the expressions
are reasonable, and no fault can be found with them. For the unwillingness of the flesh to
die incurs no condemnation; such is the nature of the flesh and He exhibits all the properties
of the flesh except sin, and indeed in full abundance, so as to stop the mouths of the heretics.

When therefore He says ‘If it be possible let this cup pass from me’ and ‘not as I will but as
Thou wilt,’ He only shews that He is really clothed with the flesh which fears death, for it is
the nature of the flesh to fear death, to draw back and to suffer agony. Now He leaves it
abandoned and stripped of its own activity, that by shewing its weakness He may convince
us also of its nature. Sometimes however He conceals it, because He was not mere man.”</p>
<p>Testimony of Severianus, bishop of Gabala.
From his discourse on the seals:—</p>
<p>“The Jews withstand the apparent, ignorant of the non-apparent; they crucify the flesh;
they do not destroy the Godhead. For if my words are not destroyed together with the letter
which is the clothing of speech, how could God the Word, the fount of life, die together
with the flesh? The passion belongs to the body, but impassibility to the dignity.”</p>
<p>See then how they whose husbandry is in the East and in the West, as well as in the
South and in the North, have all been shewn by us to condemn your vain heresy, and all
openly to proclaim the impassibility of the divine Nature. See how both tongues, I mean
both Greek and Latin, make one harmonious confession about the things of God.</p>
<p>Eran.—I am myself astonished at their harmony, but I observe a considerable difference
in the terms they use.</p>
<p>Orth.—Do not be angry. The very force of their fight against their adversaries is the
cause of their seeming immoderate. The same thing is to be observed in the case of planters;
when they see a plant bent one way or another, they are not satisfied with bringing it to a
straight line, but bend it still further in the opposite direction, that by its being bent still
further from the straight it may attain its upright stature. But that you may know that the
very promoters and supporters of this manifold heresy strive to surpass even the heretics
of old by the greatness of their blasphemies, listen once more to the writings of Apollinarius
which proclaim the impassibility of the divine nature, and confess the passion to be of the
body.</p>
<p>Testimony of Apollinarius.</p>
<p>From his summary:—</p>
<p>“John spoke of the temple which was destroyed, namely the body of Him that raised it,
and the body is entirely united to Him and He is not another among them. And if the body
of the Lord was one with the Lord, the properties of the body were constituted His properties
on account of the body.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“And the truth is that His conjunction with the body does not take place by circumscription
of the Word, so that He has nothing beyond His incorporation. Wherefore even in
death immortality abides with Him; for if He transcends this composition, so does He also
the dissolution. Now death is dissolution. But He was not comprehended in the composition;

<pb n="527"/>
had He been so, the universe would have been made void; nor in the dissolution did He,
like the soul, suffer the deprivation which succeeds dissolution.”</p>
<p>And again:—</p>
<p>“As the Saviour says that the dead bodies go forth from their tombs, though their souls
do not go forth thence, just so He says that He Himself will rise from the dead, although it
is only His body that rises.”</p>
<p>In another similar work he writes:—</p>
<p>“Of man is the rising from the dead; of God is the raising. Now Christ both rose and
raised, for He was God and man. Had the Christ been only man He would not have quickened
the dead, and if He had been only God, He would not on His own account apart from the
Father have quickened any of the dead. But Christ did both; the same being is both God
and man. If the Christ had been only man He would not have saved the world; if He had
been only God He would not have saved it through suffering, but Christ did both, so He is
God and man. If the Christ had been only man or if only God He could not have been a
Mediator between men and God.”</p>
<p>And a little further on:—</p>
<p>“Now flesh is an instrument of life fitted to the capacity for suffering in accordance with
the divine will. Words are not proper to the Flesh, nor are deeds. Being made subject to the
capacity for suffering, as is natural to the flesh, it prevails over the suffering because it is the
flesh of God.”</p>
<p>And again a little further on:—</p>
<p>“The Son took flesh of the Virgin and travelled to the world. This flesh He filled with
the Holy Ghost to the sanctification of us all. So He delivered death to death and destroyed
death through the resurrection to the raising of us all.”</p>
<p>From his tract concerning the faith:—</p>
<p>“Since the passions are concerned with the flesh His power possessed its own impassibility,
so to refer the passion to the power is an impious error.”</p>
<p>And in his tract about the incarnation he further writes:—</p>
<p>“Here then He shews that it was the same man who rose from the dead and God who
reigns over all creation.”</p>
<p>You see now that one of the professors of vain heresy plainly preaches the impassibility
of the Godhead, calls the body a temple, and persists in maintaining that this body was
raised by God the Word.</p>
<p>Eran.—I have heard and I am astonished; and I am really ashamed that our doctrines
should appear less tenable than the innovation of Apollinarius.</p>
<p>Orth.—But I will bring you a witness from yet another heretical herd distinctly preaching
the impassibility of the Godhead of the only begotten.</p>
<p>Eran.—Whom do you mean?</p>

<pb n="528"/>
<p>Orth.—You have probably heard of Eusebius the Phoenician, who was bishop of Emesa
by Lebanon.1565</p>
<p>Eran.—I have met with some of his writings, and found him to be a supporter of the
doctrines of Arius.</p>
<p>Orth.—Yes; he did belong to that sect, but in his endeavour to prove that the Father was
greater than the only begotten he declares the Godhead of the depreciated Son to be im
passible and for this opinion he contended with long and extraordinary perseverance.</p>
<p>Eran.—I should be very much obliged if you would quote his words too.</p>
<p>Orth.—To comply with your wish I will adduce somewhat longer evidence. Now listen
to what he says, and fancy that the man himself is addressing us.</p>
<p>Testimony of Eusebius of Emesa:—</p>
<p>“Wherefore does he fear death? Lest he suffer anything from death? For what was death
to Him? Was it not the severance of the power from the flesh? Did the power receive a nail
that it should fear? If our soul suffers not the body’s infirmities when united with it, but the
eye grows blind and yet the mind retains its force; and a foot is cut off and yet the reasoning
power does not halt—and this nature evidences, and the Lord sets His seal on, in the words
‘Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul’ (and if they cannot kill
the soul, it is not because they do not wish, but because they are not able, though they would
like to make the soul share the suffering of the body yoked with it)—shall He who created
the soul and formed the body suffer as the body suffers, although He does take upon Himself
the body’s sufferings? But Christ suffered for us, and we lie not. ‘And the bread that I will
give is my flesh.’1566 This He gave for us.</p>
<p>“That which can be mastered was mastered; that which can be crucified was crucified,
but He that had power alike to dwell in it and to leave it said ‘Father into thy hands I commend
my Spirit,’1567 not into the hands of them who were trying to hasten His death. I am
not fond of controversy; I rather avoid it; with all gentleness I wish to enquire into the points
at issue between us as between brothers. Do not I say truly that the power could not be
subject to the sufferings of the flesh? I say nothing; let him who will say what the power
suffered. Did it fail? See the danger. Was it extinct? See the blasphemy. Did it no longer exist?
This is the death of power. Tell me what can so master it that it suffered and I withdraw.
But, if you cannot tell me, why do you object to my not telling you? What you cannot tell
me, that it did not receive. Drive a nail into a soul and I will admit that it can be driven into

power. But it was in sympathy. Tell me what you mean by ‘in sympathy.’ As a nail went into
the flesh, so pain into the power. Let us understand ‘was in sympathy’ in this sense. Then
pain was felt by the power which was not smitten. For pain always follows on suffering. But
if a body often despises pain while the mind is sound, on account of the vigour of its thought,
then in this case let some one explain impartially what suffered and what suffered with or
was in sympathy. What then? Did not Christ die for us? How did He die? ‘Father, into thy
hands I commend my Spirit.’1568 The Spirit departed; the body remained; the body remained
without breath. Did He not die then? He died for us. The Shepherd offered the sheep, the
Priest offered the sacrifice, He gave Himself for us. ‘He that spared not His own Son but
delivered Him up for us all.’1569 I do not reject the words, but I want the meaning of the
words. The Lord says that the bread of God came down from Heaven,1570 and though I
cannot express it more clearly on account of the mysteries, He says in explanation ‘It is my
flesh.’ Did the flesh of the Son come down from heaven? No. How then does He say, and
that in explanation, the bread of God lives and came down from Heaven? He refers the
properties of the power to the flesh, because the power which assumed the flesh came down
from heaven. Change the terms then; He refers to the power what the flesh suffers. How
did Christ suffer for us? He was spat upon, He was smitten on the cheek, they put a crown
about His brow, His hands and feet were pierced. All these sufferings were of the body, but
they are referred to Him that dwelt therein. Throw a stone at the Emperor’s statue. What

have rebelled against the Emperor.’ Crucify Christ’s body. What is the cry? ‘Christ died for
us.’ But what need of me and thee? Let us go to the Evangelists. How have you received from

if I say that the Power which was before the ages, by nature incorporeal, in dignity impassible,
which exists with the Father and by the Father’s side, on His right hand and in glory, if I say

ears when you hear this, I shall stop my heart. Can we do anything to an angel? Smite him
with a sword? Or cut him in pieces? Why do I say to an angel? Can we to a soul? Does a soul
receive a nail? A soul is neither cut nor burnt. Do you ask why? Because it was so created.
Are His works impassible and He Himself passible? I do not reject the oeconomy; on the
contrary, I welcome the ill-treatment. Christ died for us and was crucified. So it is written;
so the nature admitted. I do not blot out the words nor do I blaspheme the nature. But this
is not true. Very well, then let something truer be said. The teacher is a benefactor, never
harsh, never an enemy, unless the pupil be headstrong. Have you anything good to say? My
ears are gratefully open. Does any one want to quarrel? Let him quarrel at his leisure. Could
the Jews crucify the Son of God and make the power itself a dead body? Can the living die?
The death of this power is its failure. Even when we die, our body is left. But if we make that
power a dead body we reduce it to non-existence. I am afraid you cannot hear. If the body
die, the soul is separated from it and remains; but if the soul die, since it has no body, it altogether
ceases to exist. A soul by dying altogether ceases to be. For the death of the immortals
is a contradiction of their existence. Consider the alternative; for I do not dare even to
mention it. We say these things as we understand them, but if any one is contentions, we
lay down no law. But I know one thing, that every man must reap the fruit of his opinions.
Each man comes to God and brings before Him what he has said and thought about Him.
Do not suppose that God reads books, or is troubled by having to recollect what you said
or who heard you: all is made manifest. The judge is on the throne. Paulus1572 is brought
before Him. ‘Thou saidst I was a man; thou hast no life with Me. Thou knewest not Me; I
know not thee.’ Up comes another. ‘Thou saidst I was one of the things that are created.1573
Thou knewest not My dignity; I know not thee.’ Up comes another. ‘Thou saidst that I did
not assume a body. Thou madest light of My grace. Thou shalt not share My immortality.’
Up comes another. ‘Thou saidst that I was not born of a Virgin to save the body of the Virgin;
thou shalt not be saved.’ Each one reaps the fruit of his opinions about the faith.”</p>
<p>You see the other sect of your teachers, in which you supposed that you had learnt the
suffering of the Godhead of the only Begotten, abhors this blasphemy, preaches the impassibility
of the Godhead, and quits the ranks of them who dare to attribute the passion to it.</p>
<p>Eran.—Yes; I am astonished at the conflict, and I admire the man’s sense and opinions.</p>
<p>Orth.—Then, my good Sir, imitate the bees. As you flit in mental flight about the meads

<head>Demonstrations by Syllogisms.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">  
<head>That God the Word is Immutable.</head>
<p>1. We have confessed one substance of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
and have agreed that it is immutable. If then there is one substance of the Trinity, and it is
immutable, then the only begotten Son, who is one person of the Trinity, is immutable.
And, if He is immutable, He was not made flesh by mutation, but is said to have been made
flesh after taking flesh.</p>
<p>2. If God the Word was made flesh by undergoing mutation into flesh, then He is not
immutable. For no one in his senses would call that which undergoes alteration immutable.
And if He is mutable He is not of one substance with Him that begat Him. How indeed is
it possible for one part of an uncompounded substance to be mutable and the other immutable?
If we grant this we shall fall headlong into the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius, who
assert that the Son is of another substance.</p>
<p>3. If the Lord is consubstantial with the Father, and the Son was made flesh by undergoing
change into flesh, then the substance is at once mutable and immutable, which blasphemy
if any one has the hardihood to maintain, he will no doubt make it worse by his blasphemy
against the Father, for inasmuch as the Father shares the same substance, he will assuredly
call Him mutable.</p>
<p>4. It is written in the divine Scriptures that God the Word took flesh, and also a soul.
And the most divine Evangelist says the Word was made flesh.1575 We must therefore perforce
do one of two things: either we must admit the mutation of the Word into flesh, and
reject all divine Scripture, both Old and New, as teaching lies, or in obedience to the divine
Scripture, we must confess the assumption of the flesh, banishing mutation from our
thoughts, and piously regarding the word of the Evangelist. This latter we must do inasmuch
as we confess the nature of God the Word to be immutable, and have countless testimonies
to the assumption of the flesh.</p>
<p>5. That which inhabits a tabernacle is distinct from the tabernacle which is inhabited.1576
The Evangelist calls the flesh a tabernacle, and says that God the Word tabernacled therein.
“The Word,” he says, “was made flesh and dwelt among us.”1577 Now if He was made flesh
by mutation, He did not dwell in flesh. But we have been taught that He dwelt in flesh; for

“In nobis qui caro sumus.” Bengel. But see Alford in loc.</note>

<pb n="533"/>
the same Evangelist in another place calls His body a temple.1578 We must therefore believe
the Evangelist’s explanation and interpretation of what to some seemed ambiguous.</p>
<p>6. If when the Evangelist wrote “the Word was made flesh” he had added nothing which
could remove the ambiguity, perhaps the controversy about the passage might have had
some reasonable excuse, from the obscurity of the terms used. But since he immediately
went on to say “and dwelt in us,” the combatants contend to no purpose. The former clause
is explained by the latter.</p>
<p>7. The immutability of God the Word is plainly proclaimed by the most wise Evangelist,
for after saying “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,” he immediately adds, “And
we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth.”1579 But if, according to the foolish, He had undergone mutation into flesh, He would
not have remained what He was, but if even when enveloped in the flesh He emitted the
rays of His Father’s nobility, it follows that the nature which He has is immutable, and it
shines even in the body and sends abroad the brightness of the nature which is unseen. For
that light nothing can dim. “For the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth
it not,”1580 as saith the very divine John.</p>
<p>8. The illustrious Evangelist was desirous of explaining the glory of the only-begotten,
but was unable to carry out his purpose. He therefore shews it by His fellowship with the
Father. For he says He is of that nature; just as though any one to persons beholding Joseph
sunk in a slavery inconsistent with his rank, and unaware of the splendour of his descent,
were to point out that Jacob was his father, and his forefather Abraham. So in this sense the
Evangelist said that when He dwelt among us He did not dim the glory of His nature, “For
we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.” So if even when He
was made flesh it was plain who He was, then He remained who he was, and did not undergo
the mutation into flesh.</p>
<p>9. We have confessed that God the Word took not a body only but also a soul. Why
then did the divine Evangelist omit in this place mention of the soul and mention the flesh
alone? Is it not plain that he exhibited the visible nature and by its means signified the nature
united to it? For the mention of the soul is understood of course in that of the flesh. For
when we hear the prophet saying “Let all flesh bless His holy name,”1581 we do not understand
the prophet to be exhorting bodies of flesh without souls, but believe the whole to be
summoned to give praise in the summoning of a part.</p>

<pb n="534"/>
<p>10. The words “the Word was made flesh” are plainly indicative not of mutation, but
of His unspeakable loving-kindness. For after the illustrious Evangelist had said “in the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God,” and had declared
Him to be Creator of the visible and invisible, and had called Him life and true light,
adding other similar expressions, and had spoken concerning the Godhead in such terms
as human reason can take in and the language at its command can express, he went on “And
the Word was made flesh,” as though smitten with amazement and astounded at the
boundless loving-kindness. His existence is eternal; He is God; He made all things; He is
source of eternal life and of true light; and on account of the salvation of men He put about
Him the tabernacle of flesh. And He was supposed to be only that which He appeared. So
for this reason he did not even mention a soul but only the perishable and mortal flesh. Of
the soul as being immortal he said nothing in order to exhibit the boundlessness of the
kindness.</p>
<p>11. The divine Apostle calls1582 the Lord Christ seed of Abraham. But if this is true, as
true it is, then God the Word was not changed into flesh, but took on Him the seed of Abraham,
according to the teaching of the Apostle himself.</p>
<p>12. God swore to David that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would
raise up the Christ, as the prophet1583 said and as the great Peter interpreted.1584 But if God
the Word was called Christ after mutation into flesh, we shall nowhere find the truth in the
oaths. Yet we have been taught that God cannot lie; nay rather is Himself the truth. Therefore
God the Word did not undergo change into flesh, but in accordance with the promise, took
firstfruits of David’s seed.</p>

<head>Proofs that the Union was without Confusion.</head>
<p>1. Those who believe that after the union there was one nature both of Godhead and of
manhood, destroy by this reasoning the peculiarities of the natures; and their destruction
involves denial of either nature. For the confusion of the united natures prevents us from
recognising either that flesh is flesh or that God is God. But if even after the union the difference
of the united natures is clear, it follows that there is no confusion and that the union
is without confusion. And if this is confessed then the Master Christ is not one nature, but
one Son shewing either nature unimpaired.</p>
<p>2. We too assert the union, and ourselves confess that it took place at the conception;
if then by the union the natures were mixed and confounded, how was the flesh after the
birth not seen to possess any new quality, but exhibited the human character, preserved the
dimensions of the babe, was wrapped in swaddling clothes, and sucked a mother’s breast?
And if all this did not come to pass in mere phantasy and seeming, then they admit of neither
phantasy nor seeming; then what was seen was truly a body. And if this be granted then the
natures were not confounded by the union, but each remained unimpaired.</p>
<p>3. The authors of this patchwork and incongruous heresy at one time assert that God
the Word was made flesh, and at another declare that the flesh underwent a change into
nature of Godhead. Either statement is futile and vain and full of falsehood, for if God the
Word, as they argue, was made flesh, why then do they call Him God, and this alone, and
refuse to name Him man as well, and find great fault with us who in addition to confessing
Him as God also call Him man? But if the flesh was changed into the nature of Godhead,
wherefore do they substitute the antitypes of the body? For the type is superfluous when
the reality is destroyed.</p>
<p>4. An incorporeal nature is not corporeally circumcised, but the word corporeally is
added on account of the spiritual circumcision of the heart; so then the circumcision is of
a body; but the Master Christ is circumcised after the union. And if this is granted then the
argument of the confusion is confuted.</p>
<p>5. We have learnt that the Saviour Christ hungered and thirsted, and we have believed
that this was so really and not in seeming, but such conditions belong not to a bodiless
nature but to a body. The Master Christ then had a body which before the resurrection was
affected according to its nature. And to this the divine Apostle bears testimony when he
says “For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities
but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.”1585 For the sin is not
of the nature but of the evil will.1586</p>
<note type="footnote">1585 Hebrews iv. 15</note>
<note type="footnote">1586 cf. note on page 164.</note>

<pb n="536"/>
<p>6. Of the divine nature the prophet David says, “Behold He that keepeth Israel shall
neither slumber nor sleep.”1587 But the narrative of the Evangelist describes the Master
Christ as sleeping in the boat. Now not sleeping and being asleep are two contrary ideas, so
the prophet contradicts the Gospels if, as they argue, the Master Christ was God alone. There
is no contradiction, for both prophecies and gospels flow from one and the same spirit. The
Master Christ therefore had a body, akin to all other bodies, affected by the need of sleep.
So the argument for the confusion is proved a fable.</p>
<p>7. Of the divine nature the prophet Isaiah said, “He shall neither be hungry nor
weary”1588 and so on. But the Evangelist says “Jesus being weary with his journey sat thus
on the well;”1589 and “shall not be weary” is contrary to “being weary.” Therefore the
prophecy is contrary to the narrative of the gospels. But they are not contrary, for both are
of one God. Not being weary is of the uncircumscribed nature which fills all things. But
moving from place to place is of the circumscribed nature; and when that which moves is
constrained to travel it is subject to the weariness of the wayfarer. Therefore what walked
and was weary was a body, for the union did not confound the natures.</p>
<p>8. To the divine Paul when shut up in prison the Master Christ said “Be not afraid
Paul”1590 and so on. But the same Christ, who drove away Paul’s fear, Himself so feared, as
testifies the blessed Luke that He sweated from all His body drops of blood, and with them
sprinkled all the ground about His body, and was strengthened by angelic succour,1591 and
these statements are opposed to one another, for how can fearing be other than contrary to
driving away fear? Yet they are not contrary. For the same Christ is by nature God and man;
as God He strengthens them that need consolation; as man He receives consolation through
an angel. And although the Godhead and the Spirit were present as an anointing, the body
and the soul were not then supported either by the Godhead united to them or by the Holy
Ghost, but this service was entrusted to an angel in order to exhibit the infirmity both of
the soul and of the body and that through the infirmity might be seen the natures of the
infirm. Now these things plainly happened by the permission of the divine nature, that,
among them that were to live in future times, believers in the assumption of the soul and
of the body might be vindicated by these demonstrations, and their opponents by plain
proof convicted. If then the union was effected by the conception, and, as they argue, made
both natures one, how could the properties of the natures continue unimpaired, the soul

<pb n="537"/>
agonize, and the body sweat so as to sweat bloody drops from excess of fear? But if the one
is natural to the body and the other to the soul, then the union did not effect one nature of
flesh and Godhead, but one Son appeared shewing forth in Himself both the human and
the divine.</p>
<p>9. Should they say that after the resurrection the body underwent mutation into Godhead
they may properly be answered thus. Even after the resurrection the body was seen circumscribed
with hands and feet and all the body’s parts; it was tangible and visible; it had wounds
and scars, as it had before the resurrection. One then of two alternatives must be maintained.
Either these parts must be attributed to the divine nature, if the body when changed into
the divine nature had these parts; or on the other hand it must be confessed that the body
remained within the bounds of its own nature. Now the divine nature is simple and incomposite,
but the body is composite and divided into many parts; therefore it was not changed
into the nature of Godhead, but even after the resurrection though immortal, incorruptible
and full of divine glory, it remains a body with its own circumscription.</p>
<p>10. To the unbelieving apostles the Lord after His resurrection shewed His hands, His
feet, and the prints of the nails; then further to teach them that what they saw was not a
vision He added “a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.”1592 Therefore the
body was not changed into spirit it was flesh and bones and hands and feet. Consequently
even after the resurrection the body remained a body.</p>
<p>11. The divine nature is invisible, but the thrice blessed Stephen said that he saw the
Lord,1593 so even after the resurrection the Lord’s body is a body, and it was seen by the
victorious Stephen, since the divine nature cannot be seen.</p>
<p>12. If all mankind shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven, according
to the Lord’s own words,1594 and He said to Moses “No man shall see me and live,”1595 and
both are true, then He will come with the body with which He ascended into heaven. For
that body is visible, and of this the angel spoke to the Apostles “This same Jesus which is
taken up from you into Heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
Heaven.”1596 If this is true, as true it is, then there is not one nature of flesh and Godhead,
but the union is without confusion.</p>

<head>Proof that the Divinity of the Saviour is Impassible.</head>
<p>1. Alike by the divine Scripture and by the holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa we have
been taught to confess that the Son is of one substance with God the Father. The impassibility
of the Father is also taught by the nature and proclaimed by the divine Scripture. We
shall then further confess the Son to be impassible, for this definition is enforced by the
identity of substance. Whenever then we hear the divine Scripture proclaiming the cross
and the death of the Master Christ we attribute the passion to the flesh, for in no wise is the
Godhead, being by nature impassible, capable of suffering.</p>
<p>2. “All things that the Father hath are mine”1597 says the Master Christ, and one out of
all is impassibility. If therefore as God He is impassible, He suffered as man. For the divine
nature does not undergo suffering.</p>
<p>3. The Lord said “the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of
the world,”1598 and again “I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of
mine<gap reason="omitted"/>and I lay down my life for the sheep.”1599 So body and soul are both given by the
good shepherd for the sheep who have soul and body.</p>
<p>4. The nature of men is compounded of body and soul. But it sinned and stood in need
of a sacrifice free from every spot. So the Creator took a body and a soul, and keeping them
clean from the stains of sin for men’s bodies gave His body and for their souls His soul. If
this is true, and true it is, for these are words of truth itself, then wild and blasphemous are
they who ascribe passion to the divine nature.</p>
<p>5. The blessed Paul called the Christ “the first born of the dead;”1600 and I suppose the
first born has the same nature as they of whom He is called first born. As man then He is
first born of the dead, for He first destroyed the pangs of death and gave to all the sweet
hope of another life. As He rose so He suffered. As man then He suffered but as awful God
He remained impassible.</p>
<p>6. The divine Apostle calls our Saviour Christ “the firstfruits of them that slept,”1601
but the firstfruits are related to the whole whereof they are firstfruits. He is not therefore
called firstfruits as God, for what relationship is there between Godhead and manhood?
The former is an immortal nature, the latter mortal. Such is the nature of them that sleep,
of whom Christ is called firstfruits. To this nature belong death and resurrection, and in its
resurrection we have a proof of the general resurrection.</p>

<note type="footnote">1601 1 Cor. xv. 20</note>

<pb n="539"/>
<p>7. When the Master Christ wished to persuade the doubting Apostles that He had destroyed
death and risen, He shewed them parts of His body, His side, His hands, His feet and
the marks of the passion preserved therein. This body then rose, and this, I ween, was shown
to the disbelievers. What rose is what was buried, and what was buried is what had died,
and what had died is of course what was nailed to the cross. So the divine nature united to
the body remained impassible.</p>
<p>8. They who describe the flesh of the Lord as giver of life make life itself mortal by their
words. They ought to have seen that it was giver of life through the life united to it. But if
according to their argument the life is mortal, how could the flesh being itself by nature
mortal, and made life-giving through the life, remain life-giving?</p>
<p>9. God the Word is by nature immortal, and the flesh by nature mortal, but after the
passion by union with the Word the flesh itself became immortal. How then is it not absurd
to say that the giver of such immortality shared death?</p>
<p>10. They who maintain that God the Word suffered in the flesh should be asked the
meaning of what they say, and should they have the hardihood to reply that when the body
was pierced with nails the divine nature was sensible of pain, let them learn that the divine
nature did not fill the part of a soul. God the Word had assumed a soul with the body. Should
they reject this argument as blasphemous, and should they assert that the flesh suffered by
nature, and that God the Word made the passion His own as of His own flesh, let them not
propound puzzling and murky phrases, but let them clearly propound the meaning of the
ill sounding phrase. They will have all those who wish to follow the divine Scripture as their
supporters in this interpretation.</p>
<p>11. The divine Peter in his Catholic Epistle says that Christ suffered in the flesh.1602 But
he who hears that Christ suffered does not understand God the Word incorporeal, but incarnate.
The name of Christ indicates both natures; but the word “flesh” connected with
the passion signifies not that both, but that one of the two, suffered. For he that hears that
Christ suffered in the flesh thinks of Him as impassible in that He was God, and attributes
the passion to the flesh alone. For just as when we hear him saying that God had sworn to
David of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh to raise up the Christ, we do not say that
God the Word derived His origin from David, but that the flesh which God the Word took
was akin to David, so must he who hears that Christ suffered in the flesh, recognise that the
passion belongs to the flesh, and confess the impassibility of the Godhead.</p>
<p>12. When on the cross the Lord Christ said, “Father into Thy hands I commend my
spirit,”1603 this spirit is said by the Arians and the Eunomians to be the Godhead of the
only-begotten, for they hold that the body which He took was without a soul, but the heralds
<note type="footnote">1602 1 Pet. i. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">1603 Luke xxiii. 46</note>

<pb n="540"/>
of the truth say that the soul was so called and they base their opinion on the following
passages. The right wise Evangelist immediately adds “And having said thus He gave up the
ghost.”1604 So says Luke, and the blessed Mark similarly adds “He gave up the ghost.”1605
The divine Matthew writes, “yielded up the Ghost,”1606 and the divine John, “gave up the
Ghost.”1607 All speak according to the usage of men, for we are accustomed to use all these
expressions about those who die; none of them conveys any meaning of Godhead, but they
all signify the soul, and if any one were to receive the Arian sense of the passage none the
less even thus will it shew the immortality of the divine nature. For Christ commended it
to the Father. He did not yield it to death. If then they that deny the assumption of the soul,
and maintain God the Word to be a creature, and assert that He was in the body in place of
a soul, deny that He was delivered to death, how can they obtain pardon who while they
confess one substance of the Trinity, and leave the soul in its own immortality, impudently
dare to say that God the Word of one substance with the Father tasted death?</p>
<p>13. If Christ is both God and man, as the divine Scripture teaches, and the illustrious
Fathers persistently preached, then He suffered as man, but as God remained impassible.</p>
<p>14. If they acknowledge the assumption of the flesh, and declare it to be passible before
the resurrection, and preach that the nature of the Godhead is impassible, why, leaving the
passible nature, do they attribute the passion to the impassible?</p>
<p>15. If our Lord and Saviour nailed the handwriting to the cross, as says the divine
Apostle,1608 He then nailed the body, for on his body every man like letters marks the prints
of his sins, wherefore on behalf of sinners He gave up the body that was free from all sin.</p>
<p>16. When we say that the body or the flesh or the manhood suffered, we do not separate
the divine nature, for as it was united to one hungering, thirsting, aweary, even asleep, and
undergoing the passion, itself affected by none of these but permitting the human nature
to be affected in its own way, so it was conjoined to it even when crucified, and permitted
the completion of the passion, that by the passion it might destroy death; not indeed receiving
pain from the passion, but making the passion its own, as of its own temple, and of the flesh
united to it, on account of which flesh also the faithful are called members of Christ, and
He Himself is styled the head of them that believed.</p>

<head>I. To an Unknown Correspondent.</head>
<p>In the words of the prophet we find the wise hearer mentioned with the excellent
councillor.1609 I, however, send the book I have written on the divine Apostle, not as much
to a wise hearer as to a just and clever judge. When goldsmiths wish to find out if their gold
is refined and unalloyed, they apply it to the touchstone; and just so I sent my book to your
reverence, for I wish to know whether it is what it should be, or needs some fining down.
You have read it and returned it, but have said nothing to me on this point. Your silence
leads me to conjecture that the judge has given sentence of condemnation, but is unwilling
to hurt my feelings by telling me so. Pray dismiss any such idea, and do not hesitate to tell
me your opinion about the book.</p>

<p>When men love warmly, I doubt whether in the case of the children of those whom they
love, they can be impartial judges. Justice is carried away by affection. Fathers fancy that
their ugly boys are beautiful, and sons do not see the uncomeliness of their fathers. Brother
looks at brother in the light of affection rather than of nature. It is thus that I am afraid your
holiness has judged what I have written, and that the sentence has been delivered by warmth
of feeling. For truly the power of love is very great, and not seldom it keeps out of sight
considerable errors in our friends. It is because you have so much of it, my dear friend, that
you have wreathed what I have written with your kindly praises. All I can do is to ask your
piety to beseech the good Lord to ratify your eulogy, and make the man you have praised
something like the picture painted in the words of his admirers.</p>

<head>III. To Bishop Irenæus.1610</head>
<p>Comparisons of this kind are forbidden by the divine Apostle. In his Epistle to the Romans
he writes “Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will
bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart:
and then shall every man have praise of God.”1611 And he is quite right; for we can see only
outward deeds, but the God of all knows also the intention of the doers, and when He delivers
his sentence judges not so much the work as the will. So He will crown the divine Apostle
who became to the Jews as a Jew, to them that were under the law as under the law, and to
them that were without law as without law1612 for his object in thus assuming an actor’s
mask was that he might do good to mankind. His was no time-server’s career. The gain he
got was loss, but he secured the good of them whom he taught. As I said, then, the divine
Paul bids us wait for the judgment of God. But we are venturing on high themes; we are
handling a theology passing understanding and words; not, like the unholy heretics, seeking
blasphemous positions, but endeavouring to confute their impiety, and as far as in us lies
to give praise to the Creator; we shall therefore do nothing unreasonable in attempting to
reply to your enquiry.</p>
<p>You have suggested the case of an impious judge giving to two athletes of piety the alternative
of sacrificing to demons, or flinging themselves into the sea. You describe the one
as choosing the latter and plunging without hesitation into the deep, while the other, refusing
both, shews quite as much abhorrence of the worship of idols as his companion, but declines
to commit himself to the waves, and waits for this fate to be violently forced upon him. You
have suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the better course.
I think that you will agree with me that the latter was the more praiseworthy. No one ought
to withdraw himself from life unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death.
Our Lord gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city flee to another
and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to another.1613 In obedience
to this teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence of the governor of the city, and had
no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but spoke of the basket, the wall, and
the window, and boasted and glorified in the act.1614 For what looks discreditable is made

honourable by the divine command. In the same manner the Apostle called himself at one
time a Pharisee1615 and at another a Roman,1616 not because he was afraid of death, but
acting quite fairly in fight.1617 In the same way when he had learnt the Jews’ plot against
him he appealed to Cæsar1618 and sent his sister’s son to the chief captain to report the
designs hatched against him, not because he clung to this present life, but in obedience to
the divine law. For assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious
peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than once He avoided the
murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter, first of the Apostles, when he was
loosed from his chains and had escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of
John, who was surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his visit
and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house in the endeavour to
conceal himself more effectually by the removal.1619 And we shall find just the same kind
of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses, after playing the man in his struggle
with the Egyptian and finding out the next day that the homicide had become known, ran
away, travelled a long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian.1620 In like manner the
great Elias when he had learnt Jezebel’s threats did not give himself up to them which wished
to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert.1621 And if it is right and agreeable
to God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right to refuse to obey
them when they order a man to become his own murderer. Our Lord did not give in to the
devil when he bade Him throw Himself down,1622 and when he had armed against Him
the hands of the Jews by means of the scourge and the thorns and the nails, and the creature
was urging Him to bring wholesale destruction on His wicked foes, the Lord Himself forbade,
because He knew that His Passion was bringing salvation to the world, and it was for this
reason that just before His Passion He said to His Apostles “Pray that ye enter not into
temptation,”1623 and taught us to pray “Lead us not into temptation.”1624 Now let us shift

argument, and suppose the judge to have given each of the martyrs a sword, and ordered

<p>Had I heard of the death of your dignity’s most honourable husband I should have

consolatory words. They are unnecessary. They who have learnt the wisdom of philosophers
and consider what this life is, find reason strong enough to meet and break grief’s rising
surge. And even while you are remembering your long companionship, reason recognises
the divine decrees, and to meet the forces of the tears of sorrow marshals at once the course
of nature, the law of God, and the hope of the resurrection. Knowing this as I do, there is
no necessity to use many words. I only beseech you to avail yourself of good sense in the
hour of need. Think of the death of him who is gone as no more than a long journey, and
wait for the promise of our God and Saviour. For He who promised the resurrection cannot
lie, and is the fount of truth.</p>

<p>It is needless for me to bring once more to bear upon your grief the spells of the spirit.
The mere mention of the sufferings that wrought our salvation is enough to quench distress,
even at its worst. Those sufferings were all undergone for humanity. Our Lord did not destroy
death to make one body victorious over death, but through that one body to effect our
common resurrection, and make our hope of it a sure and certain hope. And if even while
our holy celebrations are bringing you manifold refreshment of soul, you cannot overcome
your sense of sorrow, let me beg you, my honoured friend, to read the very words of the
marriage contract which follow on the mention of the dowry, and to see how the wedding
is preceded by the reminder of death. Knowing as we do that men are mortal, and bethinking
us of the peace of survivors, it is customary to lay down what are called conditions, and for
no hesitation to be shewn at the mention of death before the joining together in marriage.
These are the plain words “If the husband should die first it is agreed that so and so be done;
if this lot should first fall to the wife, so and so.” We knew all this before the wedding; we
are waiting for it so to say everyday. Why then take it amiss? The union must needs be
broken either by the death of the husband or the departure of the wife. Such is the course
of life. You know, my excellent friend, alike God’s will and human nature; dispel then your
despondency and wait for the fulfilment of the common hope of the just.</p>

<p>Your piety is annoyed and distressed at the sentence passed on me unjustly and without

been sorry at having given my judges reasonable grounds for what they have done, but, as
it is, my conscience is quite clear, and I feel joyful and exultant and look forward to the remission

they that knew it not are saved from being dashed upon the rocks. I indeed am especially
bound to praise the giver of all good, because I have found a noble champion who drives

<p>Job, that famous tower of adamant and noble champion of goodness, was not shaken
even by blows of continuous troubles of every sort and kind, but stood impregnable and
firm. At the end however of all his trials the righteous Law-giver explained the reason of
them in the words, “Dost thou think that I answered thee for any other reason than that
thou mightest appear just?”1627 I think that these words are known to your piety which is
able to support the many and various attacks of troubles and anxieties, and so far from
shrinking from them, exhibits the strength and stability of your administration. So the
bountiful Lord, seeing the bravery and holiness of your soul, has refused to keep a worthy
champion in concealment, and has brought him forth to the contest to adorn your venerable
head with a crown of victory, and give your struggles as a high example of good service to
the rest. So, my dear friend, conquer in this battle too, and bear bravely the death of your
son-in-law, my own dear friend. Conquer in your wisdom the claims of kinsmanship and
the memory of a noble and generous character, a memory which must always recall something
beyond painter’s art or rhetorician’s skill. Repel the assault of sorrow by the thought
of Him who wisely administers all the affairs of men, with perfect knowledge of the future
and right guidance of it for our good. Let us join in the joy of him who has been delivered
from this life’s storms. Let us rather give thanks because, wafted by kindly winds, he has
cast anchor in the windless haven and has escaped the grievous shipwrecks whereof this life

anoint for endurance one who is a trainer of other athletes? Still I write. It is a comfort to
myself to write as I do. I am really and truly grieved when I remember an intimacy that I

Perhaps time may even improve it, unless it turns it sour; for wine, like the body, and

<head>XIV. To Alexandra.</head>
<p>Had I only considered the character of the loss which you have sustained, I should have
wanted consolation myself, not only because I count that what concerns you concerns me,
be it agreeable or otherwise, but because I did so dearly love that admirable and truly excellent
man. But the divine decree has removed him from us and translated him to the better life.
I therefore scatter the cloud of sorrow from my soul, and urge you, my worthy friend, to
vanquish the pain of your sorrow by the power of reason, and to bring your soul in this
hour of need under the spell of God’s word. Why from our very cradles do we suck the instruction
of the divine Scriptures, like milk from the breast, but that, when trouble falls upon
us, we may be able to apply the teaching of the Spirit as a salve for our pain? I know how
sad, how very grievous it is, when one has experienced the worth of some loved object,
suddenly to be deprived of it, and to fall in a moment from happiness to misery. But to them
that are gifted with good sense, and use their powers of right reason, no human contingency
comes quite unforeseen; nothing human is stable; nothing lasting; nor beauty, nor wealth,
nor health, nor dignity; nor any of all those things that most men rank so high. Some men
fall from a summit of opulence to lowest poverty; some lose their health and struggle with
various forms of disease; some who are proud of the splendour of their lineage drag the
crushing yoke of slavery. Beauty is spoilt by sickness and marred by old age, and very wisely
has the supreme Ruler suffered none of these things to continue nor abide, with the intent
that their possessors, in fear of change, may lower their proud looks, and, knowing how all
such possessions ebb and flow, may cease to put their confidence in what is short lived and
fleeting, and may fix their hopes upon the Giver of all good. I am aware, my excellent friend,
that you know all this, and I beg you to reflect on human nature; you will find that it is
mortal, and received the doom of death from the beginning. It was to Adam that God said
“Dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return.”1629 The giver of the law is He that never lies,
and experience witnesses to His truth. Divine Scripture tells us “all men have one entrance
into life and the like going out,”1630 and every one that is born awaits the grave. And all do
not live a like length of time; some men come to an end all too soon; some in the vigour of
manhood, and some after they have experienced the trials of old age. Thus, too, they who
have taken on them the marriage yoke are loosed from it, and it must needs be that either
husband first depart or wife reach this life’s end before him. Some have but just entered the
bridal chamber when their lot is weeping and lamentation; some live together a little while.
Enough to remember that the grief is common to give reason ground for overcoming grief.
Besides all this, even they who are mastered by bitterest sorrow may be comforted by the
thought that the departed was the father of sons; that he left them grown up; that he had
<note type="footnote">1629 Gen. iii. 19</note>
<note type="footnote">1630 Wisdom vii. 6</note>

<pb n="557"/>
attained a very high position, and in it, so far from giving any cause for envy, made men
love him the more, and left behind him a reputation for liberality, for hatred of all that is
bad, for gentleness and indeed for every kind of moral virtue.1631</p>
<p>But what excuse for despondency will be left us if we take to heart God’s own promises
and the hopes of Christians; the resurrection, I mean, eternal life, continuance in the kingdom,
and all that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him”?1632 Does not the Apostle
say emphatically, “I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which
are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope”?1633 I have known many
men who even without hope have got the better of their grief by the force of reason alone,
and it would indeed be extraordinary if they who are supported by such a hope should prove
weaker than they who have no hope at all. Let us then, I implore you, look at the end as a
long journey. When he went on a journey we used indeed to be sorry, but we waited his return.
Now let the separation sadden us indeed in some degree, for I am not exhorting what
is contrary to human nature, but do not let us wail as over a corpse; let us rather congratulate
him on his setting forth and his departure hence, because he is now free from a world of
uncertainties, and fears no further change of soul or body or of corporeal conditions. The
strife now ended, he waits for his reward. Grieve not overmuch for orphanhood and widow-
hood. We have a greater Guardian whose law it is that all should take good care of orphans
and widows and about whom the divine David says “The Lord relieveth the fatherless and
widow, but the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.”1634 Only let us put the rudders
of our lives in His hands, and we shall meet with an unfailing Providence. His guardianship
will be surer than can be that of any man, for His are the words “Can a woman forget her
sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet will I not
forget thee.”1635 He is nearer to us than father and mother for He is our Maker and Creator.
It is not marriage that makes fathers, but fathers are made fathers at His will.</p>

<p>I know that in my words of consolation I am somewhat late, but it is not without reason
that I have delayed to send them, for I have thought it worth while to let the violence of your
grief take its course. The cleverest physicians will never apply their remedies when a fever
is at its height, but wait for a favourable opportunity for using the appliances of their skill.
So after reckoning how sharp your anguish must be, I have let these few days go by, for if I
myself was so distressed and filled with such sorrow by the news, what must not have been
the sufferings of a husband and yoke-fellow, made, as the Scripture says, one flesh,1638 at
the violent sundering of the union cemented both by time and love? Such pangs are only
natural; but let reason devise consolation by reminding you that humanity is frail and sorrow
universal, and also of the hope of the resurrection and the will of Him who orders our lives
wisely. We must needs accept the decrees of inestimable wisdom, and own them to be for
our good; for they who reflect thus piously shall reap piety’s rewards, and so delivered from
immoderate lamentations shall pass their lives in peace. On the other hand they whom
sorrow makes its slaves will gain nothing by their wailing, but will at once live weary lives
and grieve the Guardian of us all. Receive then, my most honoured friend, a fatherly exhortation
“The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. He hath done whatsoever pleased Him.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.”1639</p>

<head>XVI. To Bishop Irenæus.1640</head>
<p>There is nothing good, it seems, in prospect for us, so, far from calming down, the
tempest troubling the Church seems to rise higher every day. The conveners of the Council
have arrived and delivered the letters of summons to several of the Metropolitans including
our own, and I have sent a copy of the letter to your Holiness to acquaint you how, as the
poet has it, “Woe has been welded by woe.”1641 And we need only the Lord’s goodness to
stay the storm. Easy it is for Him to stay it, but we are unworthy of the calm, yet the grace
of His patience is enough for us, so that haply by it we may get the better of our foes. So the
divine apostle has taught us to pray “for He will with the temptation also make a way to escape
that ye may be able to bear it.”1642 But I beseech your godliness to stop the mouths of the
objectors and make them understand that it is not for them who stand, as the phrase goes,
out of range, to scoff at men fighting in the ranks and giving and receiving blows; for what
matters it what weapon the soldier uses to strike down his antagonists? Even the great
David did not use a panoply when he slew the aliens’ champion,1643 and Samson slew
thousands on one day with the jawbone of an ass.1644 Nobody grumbles at the victory, nor
accuses the conqueror of cowardice, because he wins it without brandishing a spear or
covering himself with his shield or throwing darts or shooting arrows. The defenders of
true religion must be criticized in the same way, nor must we try to find language which
will stir strife, but rather arguments which plainly proclaim the truth and make those who
venture to oppose it ashamed of themselves.p</p>
<p>What does it matter whether we style the holy Virgin at the same time mother of Man
and mother of God, or call her mother and servant of her offspring, with the addition that
she is mother of our Lord Jesus Christ as man, but His servant as God, and so at once avoid
the term which is the pretext of calumny, and express the same opinion by another phrase?
And besides this it must also be borne in mind that the former of these titles is of general
use, and the latter peculiar to the Virgin; and that it is about this that all the controversy has
arisen, which would God had never been. The majority of the old Fathers have applied the
more honourable title to the Virgin, as your Holiness yourself has done in two or three
discourses; several of these, which your godliness sent to me, I have in my own possession,
and in these you have not coupled the title mother of Man with mother of God, but have
explained its meaning by the use of other words. But since you find fault with me for having

left out the holy and blessed Fathers Diodorus and Theodorus in my list of authorities, I
have thought it necessary to add a few words on this point.</p>
<p>In the first place, my dear friend, I have omitted many others both famous and illustrious.
Secondly this fact must be borne in mind, that the accused party is bound to produce unimpeachable
witnesses, whose testimony even his accusers cannot impugn. But if the defendant
were to call into court authorities accused by the prosecutors, even the judge himself would
not consent to receive them. If I had omitted these holy men in compiling an eulogy of the
Fathers, I should, I own, have been wrong, and should have proved myself ungrateful to my
teachers. But if when under accusation I have brought forward a defence, and have produced
unimpeachable witnesses, why do men who are unwilling to see any of these testimonies
lay me under unreasonable blame? How I reverence these writers is sufficiently shewn by
my own book in their behalf, in which I have refuted the indictment laid against them,
without fear of the influence of their accusers or even of the secret attack made upon myself.
These people who are so fond of foolish talk had better get some other excuse for their sleight
of words. My object is not to make my words and deeds fit the pleasure of this man or that
man, but to edify the church of God, and please her bridegroom and Lord. I call my conscience
to witness that I am not acting as I do through care of material things, nor because
I cling to the honour with all its cares, which I shrink from calling an unhappy one. I would
long ago have withdrawn of my own accord, did I not fear the judgment of God. And now
know well that I await my fate. And I think that it is drawing near, for so the plots against
me indicate.1645</p>

<head>XVII. To the Deaconess Casiana.</head>
<p>Had I only considered the greatness of your sorrow, I should have put off writing a little
while, that I might make time my ally in my attempt to cure it, but I know the good sense
of your piety, and so I make bold to offer you some words of consolation suggested partly
by human nature, and partly by divine Scripture. For our nature is frail, and all life is full
of such calamities, and the universal Governor and Ruler of the World,—the Lord who
wisely orders our concerns,—gives us by means of His divine oracles consolation of various
kinds, of which the writings of the holy Evangelists and the divine utterances of the blessed
prophets are full. But I am sure it is needless to cull these passages, and suggest them to your
piety, nurtured as you have been from the beginning in the inspired word, ruling your life
in accordance with them, and needing no other teaching. But I do implore you to remember
those words that charge us to master our feelings, and promise us eternal life, proclaim the
destruction of death, and announce the common resurrection of us all. Besides all this, nay,
before all this, I ask you to reflect that He who has bidden these things so be is the Lord,
that He is a Lord all wise and all good, Who knows exactly what is best for us, and to this
end guides all our life. Sometimes death is better than life, and what seems distressing is
really pleasanter than fancied joys. I beg your piety to accept the consolation offered by my
humility, that you may serve the Lord of all by nobly bearing your pain, and affording to
men as well as women an example of true wisdom. For all will admire the strength of mind
which has bravely borne the attack of grief and broken the force of its violent assault by the
magnanimity of its resolution. And we are not without great comfort in the living likenesses
of your departed son; for he has left behind him offspring worthy of deep affection, who
may be able to stay the excess of our sorrow.</p>
<p>Lastly I implore you to remember in your grief what your bodily infirmity can endure,
and to avoid increasing your sufferings by mourning overmuch; and I implore our Lord of
His infinite resources to give you ground of consolation.</p>

<head>XVIII. To Neoptolemus.</head>
<p>Whenever I cast my eyes on the divine law which calls those who are joined together
in marriage “one flesh,”1646 I am at a loss how to comfort the limb that has been sundered,
because I take account of the greatness of the pang. But when I consider the course of nature,
and the law which the Creator has laid down in the words “Dust thou art and to dust thou
shalt return,”1647 and all that goes on daily in all the world on land and sea—for either
husbands first approach the end of life or this lot first befalls the wives—I find from these
reflections many grounds of consolation; and above all the hopes that have been given us
by our Lord and Saviour. For the reason of the accomplishment of the mystery of the incarnation
was that we, being taught the defeat of death, should no more grieve beyond measure
at the loss by death of those we love, but await the longed-for fulfilment of the hope of the
resurrection. I entreat your Excellency to reflect on these things, and to overcome the pain
of your grief; and all the more because the children of your common love are with you, and
give you every ground of comfort. Let us then praise Him who governs our lives wisely, nor
rouse His anger by immoderate lamentation, for in His wisdom He knows what is good for
us, and in His mercy He gives it.</p>

<p>I have found the right eloquent orator Athanasius to be just what your letter described
him. His tongue is adorned by his speech, and his speech by his character, and all about him

<head>XX. To the Presbyter Martyrius.</head>
<p>Natural disposition appears in us before resolution of character, and, in this sense, takes
the lead; but disposition is overcome by resolution, as is plainly proved by the right eloquent
orator Athanasius. Though an Egyptian by birth, he has none of the Egyptian want of selfcontrol,
but shews a character tempered by gentleness.1648 He is moreover a warm lover of
divine things. On this account he has spent many days with me, expecting to reap some
benefit from his stay. But I, as you know, most God-beloved friend, shrink from trying so
to derive good from others, and am far from being able to impart it to those who seek it,
and this not because I grudge, but because I have not the wherewithal, to give. Wherefore
let your holiness pray that what is said of me may be confirmed by fact, and that not only
may good things be reported of me by word, but proved in deed.</p>

<head>XXI. To the Learned Eusebius.</head>
<p>The disseminators of this great news, with the idea that it would be very distasteful to
me, fancied that they might in this way annoy me. But I by God’s grace welcomed the news,
and await the event with pleasure. Indeed very grateful to me is any kind of trouble which
is brought on me for the sake of the divine doctrines. For, if we really trust in the Lord’s
promises, “The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
that shall be revealed in us.”1649</p>
<p>And why do I speak of the enjoyment of the good things which are hoped for? For even
if no prize had been offered to them that struggle for the sake of true religion, Truth alone
by her own unaided force would herself have been sufficient to persuade them that love her
to welcome gladly all perils in her cause. And the divine Apostle is witness of what I say,
exclaiming as he does, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril or sword? As it is written, ‘For thy
sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.’”1650</p>
<p>And then to teach us that he looks for no reward, but only loves his Saviour, he adds
straightway “Nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved
us.”1651</p>
<p>And he goes on further to exhibit his own love more clearly. “For I am persuaded, that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”1652</p>
<p>Behold, my friend, the flame of apostolic affection; see the torch of love.1653</p>
<p>I covet not, he says, what is His. I only long for Him; and this love of mine is an unquenchable
love and I would gladly forego all present and future felicity, aye, suffer and
endure again all kinds of pain so as to keep with me this flame in all its force. This was ex-
emplified by the divine writer in deed as well as in word and everywhere by land and sea he
has left behind him memorials of his sufferings. So when I turn my eyes on him and on the
rest of the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, priests, what is commonly reckoned
miserable I cannot but hold to be delightful. I confess to a feeling of shame when I remember
how even they who never learnt the lessons we have learnt, but followed no other guide but
human nature alone, have won conspicuous places in the race of virtue. The famous Socrates,

son of Sophroniscus, when under the calumnious indictment, not only treated the lies of
his accusers with contempt, but expressed his cheerfulness in the midst of his troubles in
the words, “Anytus and Meletus1654 can kill me, but they cannot harm me.” And the orator
of Pæania,1655 who was as wise as he was eloquent, enriched both the men of his own day
and them that should come after him with the saying: “to all the race of men the end of life
is death, even though one shut himself up for safety in a cell; so good men are bound ever
to put their hand to every honourable work, ever defending themselves with good hope as
with a shield, and bravely to bear whatever lot may be given them by God.”1656</p>
<p>Moreover a writer of earlier date than Demosthenes, I mean the son of Olorus, wrote
many noble sentiments, and among them this “We must bear what the gods send us of necessity
and the fortune of war with courage.”1657 Why need I quote philosophers, historians,
and orators? For even the men who gave higher honour to their mythology than to the truth
have inserted many useful exhortations in their stories; as Homer in his poems introduces
the wisest of the Hellenes preparing himself for deeds of valour, where he says
<lg>
<l>“He chid his angry spirit and beat his breast,</l>
<l>And said ‘Forbear my mind, and think on this:</l>
<l>There hath been time when bitterer agonies</l>
<l>Have tried thy patience.’”1658</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Similar passages might easily be collected from poets, orators, and philosophers, but
for us the divine writings are sufficient.</p>
<p>I have quoted what I have to prove how disgraceful it were for the mere disciples of
nature to get the better of us who have had the teaching of the prophets and the apostles,
trusting in the Saviour’s sufferings and looking for the resurrection of the body, freedom
from corruption, the gift of immortality and the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>So, my dear friend, comfort those who are discouraged at the stories bruited abroad,
and if anybody is pleased at them, tell them that we are happy too, that we are exulting and

heaven itself.</p>
<p>To inform those who do not know in what mind we are, be assured, most excellent
friend, that we believe, as we have been taught, in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
There is no truth in the slander of some that we have been taught to believe, or have been
baptized, or do believe, or teach others to believe, in two Sons. As we know one Father and
one Holy Ghost so we know one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God,
God the Word who was made man. We do not however deny the properties of the natures.
We hold them to be in error who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons, and we
also call them enemies of the truth who endeavour to confound the natures. We believe an
union to have been made without confusion, and we reckon some qualities to be proper to
the manhood and others to the Godhead; for just as the man—I mean man in general—reasonable
and mortal being, has a soul and has a body, and is reckoned to be one being, just
so the distinction between the two natures does not divide the one man into two persons,
but we recognise in the one man both the immortality of the soul and the mortality of the
body, and acknowledge the invisible soul and the visible body, but, as I said, one being at
once reasonable and mortal; so do we recognise our Lord and God, I mean the Son of God
our Lord Christ, even after His incarnation, to be one Son; for the union is indivisible, as
we know it is without confusion. We acknowledge too that the Godhead is without beginning,
and that the manhood is of recent origin; for the one nature is of the seed of Abraham and
David, from whom descended the holy Virgin, but the divine nature was begotten of the
God and Father before the ages without time, without passions, without severance. But
suppose the distinction between flesh and Godhead to be destroyed, what weapons shall we
use in our war with Arius and Eunomius? How shall we undo their blasphemy against the
only begotten? As it is, we apply the words of humiliation as to man, the words of exaltation
and divinity as to God, and the setting forth of the truth is very easy to us.</p>
<p>But this disquisition on the faith is exceeding the limits of a letter. Still even these few
words are enough to show the character of the apostolic faith.1659</p>

<p>It is said that what is faulty in men’s ways may be brought to order and improved by
words. But I think that characters made beautiful by nature, themselves make words fair,
though they stand in need of none, just as bodies naturally beautiful need no artificial colouring.
These qualities are conspicuous in the right eloquent orator Athanasius, and I have
been the more pleased with him because he is an ardent lover of your Excellency, and is
constantly sounding your praises. Here, however, I have striven with him, and in enumerating
your high qualities, have outdone him, for I know more about good deeds of yours than he.
I am however vexed at not being able to praise them all, and to see that my summary of

<p>In distributing wealth and poverty among men the Creator and Governor of all gives

So He brings chastisement upon men not merely in the infliction of punishment for their
faults, but to provide the wealthy with opportunities for shewing kindness to mankind. This
year the Lord has sent us scourges, far less than our sins, but enough to distress the husbandmen,
of whose sufferings I lately made your magnificence acquainted through your own
hinds. Pity, I beseech you, the tillers of the ground, who have spent their toil with but very
little result. Be this bad year a suggestion of spiritual abundance, and do ye through the exercise
of compassion gather in the harvest of the compassion of God. On this account the

the remedy. He carries this letter, like a suppliant’s branch of olive, in the hope that by its

<p>The sufferings of the Carthaginians would demand, and, in their greatness, perhaps
out-task, the power of the tragic language of an Æschylus or a Sophocles. Carthage of old
was with difficulty taken by the Romans. Again and again she contended with Rome for the
mastery of the world, and brought Rome within danger of destruction. Now the ruin has
been the mere byplay of barbarians. Now dignified members of her far-famed senate wander
all over the world, getting means of existence from the bounty of kindly strangers, moving
the tears of beholders, and teaching the uncertainty and instability of the lot of man.</p>
<p>I have seen many who have come thence, and I have felt afraid, for I know not, as the
Scripture says, “what the morrow will bring forth.”1664 Not least do I admire the admirable
and most honourable Celestinianus, so bravely does he bear his misfortune, and makes the
loss of his happiness an occasion for philosophy, praising the governor of all, and holding
that to be good which God either ordains or suffers to be. For the wisdom of divine
Providence is unspeakable. He is travelling with his wife and children, and I beg your excellency

<head>XXX. To Aerius the Sophist.1666</head>
<p>Now is the time for your Academy to prove the use of your discussions. I am told that
a brilliant assemblage collects at your house, of which the members are both illustrious by
birth and polished of speech, and that you debate about virtue and the immortality of the
soul, and other kindred subjects. Show now opportunely your nobility of soul and wealth
of virtue, and receive the most admirable and honourable Celestinianus in the spirit of men
who have learnt the rapid changes of human prosperity. He was formerly an ornament of
the city of Carthage, where he flung open the doors of his house to many priests, and never
thought to need a stranger’s kindness. Be his spokesman, my friend, and aid him in his need
of your voice, for he cannot suffer the advice of the poet which bids him that needeth speak
though he be ashamed.1667</p>
<p>Persuade I beg you any of your society who are capable of so doing to emulate the hospitality
of Alcinous,1668 to remove the poverty which has unexpectedly befallen him, and
to change his evil fortune into good. Let them praise our kindly Lord for making us wise by
other men’s calamities, not having sent us to strangers’ houses and having brought strangers
to our doors. To men that shew kindness He promises to give what words cannot express
and no intelligence can understand.</p>

<head>XXXI. To Domnus Bishop of Antioch.1669</head>
<p>The most admirable and honourable Celestinianus is a native of the famous Carthage,
and of an illustrious family in that city. Now he has been exiled from it. He is wandering in
foreign parts, and has to look to the benevolence of them that love God. He carries with
him a burden from which he cannot escape and which increases his care—I mean his wife,
his children and his servants, for whom he is at great expense. I wonder at his spirit. For he
praises the great Pilot as though he were being borne by favourable breezes, and cares
nothing for the terrible storm. From his calamity he has reaped the fruit of piety, and this
thrice blessed gain has been brought him by his misfortune; for while he was in prosperity
he never accepted this teaching, but when the evil day left him bare, among the rest of his
losses he lost his impiety too, and now possesses the wealth of the faith, and for its sake
thinks little of his ruin.</p>
<p>I therefore beseech your holiness to let him find a fatherland in these foreign parts, and
to charge them that abound in riches to comfort one who once was endowed like themselves,
and to scatter the dark cloud of his calamity. It is only right and proper that among men of
like nature, where all have erred, they that have escaped chastisement should bring comfort
to them that have fallen on evil days, and by their sympathy for these latter propitiate the
mercy of God.</p>

<head>XXXII. To the Bishop Theoctistus.1670</head>
<p>If the God of all had forthwith inflicted punishment on all that err he would utterly have
destroyed all men. But He spares; He is a merciful Judge; and therefore some He chastises,
and to others He gives the lesson of the punishment of the chastised. An instance of this
merciful dealing has been shewn in our times. Exiles from what was once known as Libya,
but is now called Africa, have been brought by Him to our doors, and by shewing us their
sufferings He moves us to fear, and by fear rouses us to sympathy; thus He accomplishes
two ends at once, for He both benefits us by their chastisement, and to them by our means
brings comfort. This comfort I now beg you to give to the very admirable and honourable
Celestinianus, a man who once was an ornament of the Africans’ chief city, but now has
neither city nor home, nor any of the necessaries of life. Now it is proper that those who in
the jurisdiction of your holiness have been entrusted with the pastoral care of souls should
bring before their fellow citizens what is for their good, for indeed they need such teaching.
For this reason, as we know, the divine Apostle in his Epistle to Titus writes “Let ours also
learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,”1671 for if our city, solitary as it is, and
with only a small population, and that a poor one, succours the strangers, much rather may
Beroea,1672 which has been nurtured in true religion, be expected to do so, especially under
the leadership of your holiness.</p>

<p>To narrate the sufferings of the most honourable and dignified Celestinianus would
require tragic eloquence. Tragic writers set forth fully the ills of humanity, but I can only in
a word inform your excellency that his country is Libya, so long on all men’s tongues, his
city the far famed Carthage, his hereditary rank a seat in her famous council, his circumstances
affluent. But all this is now a tale, mere words stripped bare of realities. The barbarian
war has deprived him of all this. But such is fortune; she refuses to remain always with
the same men and hastens to change her abode to dwell with others.1674 I beg to introduce
this guest to your excellency, and beseech you that he may enjoy your far famed beneficence.
I beg also that through your excellency he may become known to all those who are in office
and opulence, in order that you may both become a means of advantage to them and win
the higher reward from our merciful God.</p>

<p>All kinds of goodness are praiseworthy, but all are made more beautiful by loving
kindness. For it we earnestly pray the God of all; through it alone we obtain forgiveness
when we err; it makes wealth stoop to the poor, and because I know that your Excellency is
richly endowed with it I confidently commend to you the admirable and excellent Celestinianus,
once lord of vast wealth and possessions and suddenly stripped of all, but bearing his
poverty as easily as few men bear their riches. The subject of the tragedy involving the fall
of his fortunes is the barbarian invasion of Libya and Carthage. I have introduced him to
your greatness; pray suggest his case to others, and move them to pity. You will win greater
gain by giving many a lesson in loving kindness:</p>

<head>XXXV. To the Bishop Irenæus.1675</head>
<p>You are conspicuous, my Lord, for many forms of goodness, and your holiness is
beautified in an especial degree by loving-kindness, by contempt of riches, and by a generosity
that gushes forth for the help of them that need. I know too that you deem worthy of
more than ordinary attention those who have been brought up in prosperity and have fallen
from it into trouble. Knowing this as well as I do I venture to make known to you the very
admirable and excellent Celestinianus. He was once well known in Carthage for wealth and
position, now stripped of these he is favourably known by his piety and philosophy, for he
bears what men call misfortune with resignation because it has brought him to the salvation
of his soul. He came to me with a letter which described his former prosperity, and after he
had passed several days with me I proved the truth of what was said of him by experience.
I have therefore no hesitation in commending him to your Holiness, and begging you to
make him known to the well-to-do men of the city. It is probable that when they have learnt
what has befallen him, in fear of a like fate befalling themselves, they will endeavour to escape
judgment by shewing mercy. He has no resource but to go about begging, as he is put to the
greater expense because he has with him his wife and children, and the domestics who with
him escaped the violence of the barbarians.</p>

admirable and excellent Celestinianus, once enjoying much wealth and prosperity, but now
escaped from the hands of the barbarians with nothing but freedom, and having no means
of livelihood except the mercy of men like your piety. And cares crowd round him, for
travelling with him are his wife, children and servants, whom he has brought with him from
no motives but those of humanity, for he cannot think it right to dismiss them when they
refuse to abandon him. I beg you of your goodness to make him known to our wealthy citizens,
for I think that, after being informed by your holiness and seeing how soon prosperity
may fall away, they will bethink them of our common humanity, and, in imitation of your
magnanimity, will give him such help as they can.</p>

<p>When rulers keep the scales of justice true, and let them hang in even balance, they
confer all kinds of benefits upon their subjects; if they are also gifted with prudence and
further show loving-kindness to him that needs it, manifold advantages accrue from their
rule to them that live under it. Having enjoyed these good things through your excellency,
and having experienced them in your former administration, they have now been moved
with joy at the information that to your munificence the helm of government has been entrusted.
I pray that they may gain yet greater good, that your excellency may win still higher
praise, and that the encomiums of your eulogists may be vindicated by the addition to all
your other honourable titles to fame of that colophon1677 of good things—true religion. As
I was compelled to pass several days in Hierapolis I hoped to have the pleasure of meeting
your excellency, and persistently enquired of new comers if the insignia of office had been
conveyed to you. But I was compelled by the divine feast of salvation to return in haste to
the city entrusted to me. Now however that I have received your excellency’s letter, with
very great pleasure I return your salutation, and without delay have sent, as you requested,
the honourable and pious deacon who is by God’s grace a water-finder. May the Lord in

<p>The divine feast of salvation has brought us the founts of God’s good gifts, the blessing
of the Cross, and the immortality which sprang from our Lord’s death, the resurrection of
our Lord Jesus Christ which gives promise of the resurrection of us all. These being the gifts
of the feast, such its exhibition of the bounty of divine grace, it has filled us with spiritual
gladness. But encompassed as we are on every side by many and great calamities, the
brightness of the feast is dimmed, and lamentation and wailing are mingled with our
psalmody. Such sorrows does sin bring forth. It is sin which has filled our life with pangs;
it is on account of sin that death is lovelier to us than life; it is on account of sin that when
we think in imagination of that incorruptible tribunal we shudder even at the life to come.
So may your piety pray that God’s loving-kindness may light on us, and that this gloomy

and affrighted at the anger and grief of the Lord? Who is not stirred to the memory of faults?
Who does not look for the righteous sentence? All this dims the brightness of the feast, but
the Lord is full of loving-kindness, and we trust He will not actually fulfil His threats, but
will look mercifully on us, scatter our sadness, open the springs of mercy, and shew His
wonted long suffering. I salute your greatness, and beseech you to send me news of the

every side. And we lament because we force the good Lord, who is wishful to do us good,
to do us ill, and compel Him to inflict punishment.</p>

<head>XLII. To Constantius the Prefect.1681</head>
<p>Did no necessity compel me to address a letter to your greatness, I might haply be found
guilty of presumption, for neither taking due measure of myself nor recognising the greatness
of your power. But now that all that is left of the city and district which God has committed
to my charge is in peril of utterly perishing, and certain men have dared to bring calumnious
charges against the recent visitation, I am sure your magnificence will pardon the boldness
of my letter when you enquire into the necessity of the case, my own object in writing. I
groan and lament at being compelled to write against a man over whose errors one ought
to throw a veil, because he is of the clerical order. Nevertheless I write to defend the cause
of the poor whom he is wronging. After being charged with many crimes and excluded from
the Communion, pending the assembly of the sacred Synod, in alarm at the decision of the
episcopal council he has made his escape from this place, thereby trampling, as he supposed,
on the laws of the Church, and, by his contempt of the sentence of excommunication has
laid bare his motive. He has undertaken an accusation not even fit for men of mean crafts,
and in consequence of his ill-feeling towards the illustrious Philip has proceeded against
the wretched tax-payers. I feel that it is quite needless for me to mention his character, his
course of life from the beginning and the greatness of his wrong-doings, but this one thing
I do beseech your Excellency, not to believe his lies, but to ratify the visitation, and spare
the wretched tax-payers. Aye, spare the thrice wretched decurions who cannot exact the
moneys demanded of them. Who indeed is ignorant of the severity of the taxation of the
acres among us? On this account most of our landowners have fled, our hinds have run
away, and the greater part of our lands are deserted. In discussing the land there will be no
impropriety in our using geometrical terms. Of our country the length is forty milestones,
and the breadth the same. It includes many high mountains, some wholly bare, and some
covered with unproductive vegetation. Within this district there are fifty thousand free
jugers,1682 and besides that ten thousand which belong to the imperial treasury. Now only
let your wisdom consider how great is the wrong. For if none of the country had been uncultivated,
and it had all furnished easy husbandry for the hinds, they would nevertheless
have sunk under the tribute, unable to endure the severity of the taxation. And here is a
proof of what I say. In the time of Isidorus1683 of glorious memory, fifteen thousand acres
were taxed in gold, but the exactors of the Comitian assessment, unable to bear the loss,
frequently complained, and by offerings besought your high dignity to let them off two
thousand five hundred for the unproductive acres, and your excellency’s predecessors in

this office ordered the unproductive acreage to be taken off the unfortunate decurions, and

to complete the tale.</p>

false accusations that are made against the wretched tax-payers, to stem the tide of distress
in this unhappy district, and let it once more lift its head. Thus you will leave an imperishable
memory of honour to future generations. I am joined in my supplication to you by all the
saints of our district, and especially by that right holy and pious man of God, the Lord Jacobus,
1684 who holds silence in such great esteem that he cannot be induced to write, but he
prays that our city, which is made illustrious by having him as neighbour and is protected

<p>Since you adorn the empire by your piety and render the purple brighter by your faith,

pay all due honour to the clergy. With these sentiments I beseech your majesty to deign to
show clemency to our unhappy country, to order the ratification of the visitation which has
been several times made, and not to accept the false accusations which some men have
brought against it. I beseech you to give no credit to him who bears indeed the name of
bishop, but whose mode of action is unworthy even of respectable slaves.1686 He has been
himself under serious charges and subject to the bann of excommunication under the most
holy and God-beloved archbishop of Antioch, the Lord Domnus, pending the summoning
of the episcopal council for the investigation of the charges against him. He has now made
his escape, and betaken himself to the imperial city, where he plies the trade of an informer,
attacking the country which is his mother country with its thousands of poor, and, for the
sake of his hatred to one, wags his tongue against all. Out of regard to what is becoming to
me I will say nothing as to his character and education, and indeed he shows only too plainly
what he has at present in hand. But of the district I will say this, that when the whole province
had its burdens lightened, this portion, although it bore a very heavy share of the burden,
never enjoyed the benefit of relaxation. The result is that many estates are deprived of husbandmen;
nay, many are altogether abandoned by their owners, while the wretched decurions
have demands made on them for these very properties, and, being quite unable to bear the
exaction, betake themselves some to begging, and some to flight. The city seems to be reduced
to one man, and he will not be able to hold out unless your piety supplies a remedy. But I
am in hopes that your serenity will heal the wounds in the city and add yet this one more
to your many good deeds.</p>

At the moment of my now thus writing, the district which Providence has committed to

which was made at the time when we first were benefited by your presence among us; how
it was with difficulty established in the time of the most excellent prefect the Lord Florentius;
1690 and how it was confirmed by the present holder of the office. An individual who
bears the name of bishop, but of ways unworthy even of stage players, has fled from the
episcopal synod at a time when he was lying under sentence of excommunication and is
endeavouring to calumniate and discredit the visitation, while through his hatred to the illustrious
Philip he assails the truth. I therefore beseech your excellency to make his lies of
none effect, and that the visitation lawfully confirmed may remain undisturbed. It is indeed
becoming to your greatness to reap the fruit of this good deed among the rest, to receive
the acclamations of those whom you are benefiting, and so to do honour at once to the God
of all and to his true servant the very man of God the Lord Jacob,1691 who joins with me in

there is not one of them that fear the Lord who is not much grieved at losing your official
sway, and I think that even all the rest, although they have not right knowledge about divine
things, when they reflect on the kindnesses you have conferred, share in these sentiments
of distress. I for my part am specially sorry when I bethink me of your dignity and your
unaffected character, and I pray the God of all ever to bestow on you the bulwark of His
invincible right hand, and supply you with abundance of all kinds of blessings. We beseech
your excellency no less when absent than when present to extend to us your accustomed
protection, and to undo the rage of that unworthy bishop of ours whose purposes are perfectly
well known to your greatness. He is endeavouring, as I am informed, to work the entire
ruin of our district, and has accepted the part of an informer to culumniate the recent visitation,
and this when all in a word know that the taxation of our district is very heavy, and
that in consequence many estates have been abandoned by the husbandmen. But this man,
in contempt of his excommunication, and in flight from the holy synod, has thrust out his
tongue against the unhappy poor. May your magnificence then consent to look to it that
the truth be not vanquished by a lie. And I bring the same supplication about the Cilicians.
For we cease not to wail till the iniquity be undone. The Lord, who promises to reward even
a drop of water, will requite you for this trouble.</p>

from serious danger. After entering into the enjoyment of the security which he
owed to your kindness, he filled our ears with your praises. But all your labour a certain
most pious personage was endeavouring to make null and void. The visitation made several
times twelve years ago he calumniates, and has adopted a style of slander which would be
unbecoming even in a respectable slave. Now I beseech your sanctity to put a stop to his
lies, and to induce the illustrious præfects to ratify the decision which they duly and mercifully
gave. As a matter of fact our city was taxed more severely than all the cities of the provinces,
and after every city had been relieved ours continued to this day assessed at over sixty-two
thousand acres. At last the occupants of that seat of honour were with difficulty induced to
send inspectors of the district; their report was first received by Isidorus of famous memory
and confirmed by the glorious and Christ-loving lord Florentius, and the whole matter was
very carefully enquired into by our present ruler, whose equity adorns the throne, and he
confirmed the assessment by an imperial decree. But this truth-loving person, all for his
hatred of one single individual, the excellent Philip, has declared war against the poor. Under
these circumstances I implore your holiness to array the forces of your righteous eloquence
against his eloquence of wrong, to throw your shield over the truth which is attacked and
at once prove her strength and the futility of lies.</p>

<p>I have gladly received the accusation, although I have no difficulty in disproving the
indictment. I have written not three letters only but four; and I suspect one of two things;
either those who promised to convey the letters did me wrong in the matter of their delivery,
or else your piety, though in receipt of them, is yet anxious for more, and so gets up a charge
of idleness against me. I, as I said before, am not distressed at the accusation, for it is plain
proof to me of the warmth of your affection. Continue then to ply your craft, cease not to
prefer your complaint and so to cause pleasure to myself.</p>

<p>It is the nature of mirrors to reflect the faces of them that gaze into them, and so whoever
looks at them sees his own form. This is the same too with the pupils of the eyes, for they
shew in them the likeness of other people’s features. Of this your holiness furnishes an instance,
for you have not seen my ugliness, but have beheld with admiration your own beauty.
I really have none of the qualities which you have mentioned. It is nevertheless my prayer
that your words may be vindicated by actual fact, and I beseech your piety by your prayers
to cause it to come to pass that your praises may not fall to the ground through having no
reality to correspond with them.</p>

<p>The works of virtue are admirable in themselves, but yet more admirable do they appear

<head>LII. To Ibas, Bishop of Edessa.1698</head>
<p>It is, I think, of His providential care for our common salvation that the God of all brings
on some men certain calamities, that chastisement may prove to be to them that have erred
a healing remedy; to virtue’s athletes an encouragement to constancy; and to all who look
on a beneficial exemplar. For it is natural that when we see others punished we should be
filled with fear ourselves. In view of these considerations I look on the trouble of Africa as
a general advantage. In the first place when I bear in mind their former prosperity and now
look on their sudden overthrow, I see how variable are all human affairs, and learn a twofold
lesson;—not to rejoice in felicity as though it would never come to an end, nor be distressed
at calamities as hard to bear. Then I recall the memory of past errors, and tremble lest I fall
into like sufferings. My main motive in now writing to you is to introduce to your holiness
the very God-beloved bishop Cyprianus,1699 who starting from the famous Africa is now
compelled, by the savagery of the barbarians, to travel in foreign lands.</p>
<p>He has brought a letter to us from the very holy bishop the lord Eusebius,1700 who wisely
rules the Galatians. When your piety has received him with your wonted kindness I beg you
to send him with a letter to whatever pious bishops you may think fit so that while he enjoys

<p>Among many forms of virtue by which we hear that your holiness is adorned (for all
men’s ears are filled by the flying fame of your glory, which speeds in all directions) special
praise is unanimously given to your modesty, a characteristic of which our Lord in His law
has given Himself as an ensample, saying, “Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart;”1706 for though God is high, or rather most high He honoured at His incarnation the
meek and lowly spirit. Looking then to Him, sir, you do not behold the multitude of your
subjects nor the exaltation of your throne, but you see rather human nature, and life’s rapid
changes, and follow the divine laws whose observance gives us the kingdom of heaven.
Hearing of this modesty on the part of your holiness, I take courage in a letter to salute a
person sacred and dear to God, and I offer prayers whereof the fruit is salvation. Occasion
is given me to write by the very pious presbyter Eusebius, for when I heard of his journey
thither I immediately indited this letter to call upon your holiness to support us by your
prayers, and by your reply to give us a spiritual feast, sending to us who are hungry the
blessed banquet of your words.</p>

of some delay, it was for the time postponed, for the weather kept the vessels within the
harbour, inasmuch as it indicated a coming storm at sea and bade sailors and pilots wait
awhile. So I discharged this debt for the time, not that I may cease to be a debtor but that I
may increase the debt. For this obligation becomes many times greater by being discharged,
inasmuch as they who try to observe the laws of friendship increase the potency of its love,
and, blowing sparks into a flame, kindle a greater warmth of affection, while all who are
fired thereby strive to surpass one another in love. Receive then my defence, my venerable
friend; forgive me; and send me a letter to tell me how you are.</p>

<head>LXII. To the Presbyter John.</head>
<p>A saying of one of the men who used to be called wise was, “Live unseen.” I applaud the
sentiment, and have determined to confirm the word by deed, for I see no impropriety in
gathering what is good from others, just as bees, it is said, gather their honey and draw forth
the sweet dew from bitter herbs as well as from them that are good to eat, and I myself have
seen them settling on a barren rock and sucking up its scanty moisture. Far more reasonable
is it for them that are credited with reason to harvest what is good from every source; so, as
I said, I try to live unseen, and above all men am I a lover of peace and quiet. On his recent
return from your part of the world the very pious presbyter Eusebius announced that you
had held a certain meeting, and that in the course of conversation mention had been made
of me, and that your piety spoke with praise of my insignificant self. I have therefore deemed
it ungrateful, and indeed unfair, that he who spoke thus well and kindly of me should fail
to be paid in like coin; for although we have done nothing worthy of praise still we admire
the intention of them that thus praise us, for such praise is the off-spring of affection.
Wherefore I salute your reverence, using as a means of conveyance of my letter him who
has brought to me the unwritten words which you have spoken about me. When, most pious
sir, you have received my letter, write in reply. You were first in speech; I in writing; and I

of unalloyed gladness. If, when one member is in pain the whole body is partaker of the
pang,1709 how can we forbear from lamentation when all the body is distressed? And it in-
tensifies our discouragement to think that these things are the prelude of the general apostasy.
May your piety pray that since we are in this plight we may get the divine succour, that, as
the divine Apostle phrases it, we may “be able to withstand the evil day.”1710 But if any time
remain for this life’s business, pray that the tempest may pass away, and the churches recover
their former calm, that the enemies of the truth may no more exult at our misfortunes.</p>

to be the Passion’s fruit. But when they knew the salvation that grew therefrom, they called
the proclamation of the Passion glad tidings, and eagerly offered it to all mankind. And they
that believed, as being enlightened in mind, cheerfully received it, and keep the Feast in
memory of the Passion, and make the moment of death an opportunity for entertainment
and festivity. For the close connexion with it of the resurrection does away with the sadness
of death, and becomes a pledge for the resurrection of all. After just now taking part in this

<head>LXV. To the General Zeno.1711</head>
<p>To be smitten by human ills is the common lot of all men; to endure them bravely and
rise superior to their attack is no longer common. The former is of human nature; the latter
depends upon resolution. It is on this account that we wonder how the philosophers resolved
on the noblest course of life and conquered their calamities by wisdom. And philosophy is
produced by our reason’s power, which rules our passions and is not led to and fro by them.
Now one of human ills is grief, and it is this which we exhort your excellency to overcome,
and it will not be difficult for you to rise victorious over this feeling, if you consider human
nature, and take to heart the uselessness of sorrow. For what gain will it be to the departed
that we should wail and lament? When, however, we reflect upon the common birth, the
long years of intercourse, the splendid service in the field, and the far-famed achievements,
let us reflect that he who was adorned by them was a man subject to the law of death; that
moreover all things are ordained by God, who guides the affairs of men in accordance with
His sacred knowledge of what will be for their good. Thus have I written so far as the limits
of a letter would allow me, beseeching your eminence for all our sakes to preserve your
health, which is wont to be maintained by cheerfulness and ruined by despondency.
Wherefore in my care for the advantage of us all I have penned this letter.</p>

<p>Had I not been unavoidably prevented, I should no sooner have heard that your great
and glorious husband had fallen asleep than I should straightway have hurried to your side.
I have enjoyed at your hands many and various kinds of honour, and I owe you full many
thanks. When hindered, much against my will, from paying my debt, I deemed it ill-advised
to send you a letter at the very moment, when your grief was at its height; when it was impossible
for my messenger to approach your excellency, and when grief prevented you from
reading what I wrote. But now that your reason has had time to wake from the intoxication
of grief, to repress your emotion, and to discipline the license of sorrow, I have made bold
to write and to beseech your excellency to bethink you of human nature, to reflect how
common is the loss you deplore, and, above all, to accept the divine teaching, and not let
your distress go beyond the bounds of your faith. For your most excellent husband, as the
Lord Himself said, “is not dead but sleepeth”1714—a sleep a little longer than he was wont.
This hope has been given us by the Lord; this promise we have received from the divine
oracles. I know indeed how distressing is the separation, how most distressing; and especially
so when affection is made stronger by sympathy of character and length of time. But let
your grief be for a journey into a far country, not for a life ended. This kind of philosophy
is particularly becoming to them that be brought up in piety, and it is of this philosophy
that I beseech you, my respected friend, to seek the adornment. And I do not offer you this
advice as a man labouring himself under insensibility; in truth my heart was grieved when
I learnt of the departure of one I loved so well. But I call to mind the Ruler of the world and
His unspeakable wisdom, which ordains everything for our good. I implore your holiness
to take these reflections to heart, to rise superior to your sorrow, and praise God who is the
Master of us all. It is with ineffable providence that He guides the lives of men.</p>

<head>LXX. To Eustathius, Bishop of Ægæ.1715</head>
<p>The story of the noble Mary is one fit for a tragic play. As she says herself, and as is attested
by several others, she is a daughter of the right honourable Eudæmon. In the catastrophe
which has overtaken Libya she has fallen from her father’s free estate, and has become
a slave. Some merchants bought her from the barbarians, and have sold her to some of our
countrymen. With her was sold a maiden who was once one of her own domestic servants;
so at one and the same time the galling yoke of slavery fell on the servant and the mistress.
But the servant refused to ignore the difference between them, nor could she forget the old
superiority: in their calamity she preserved her kindly feeling, and, after waiting upon their
common masters, waited upon her who was reckoned her fellow slave, washed her feet,
made her bed, and was mindful of other like offices. This became known to the purchasers.
Then through all the town was noised abroad the free estate of the mistress and the servant’s
goodness. On these circumstances becoming known to the faithful soldiers who are quartered
in our city (I was absent at the time) they paid the purchasers their price, and rescued the
woman from slavery. After my return, on being informed of the deplorable circumstances,
and the admirable intention of the soldiers, I invoked blessings on their heads, committed
the noble damsel to the care of one of the respectable deacons, and ordered a sufficient
provision to be made for her. Ten months had gone by when she heard that her father was
still alive, and holding high office in the West, and she very naturally expressed a desire to
return to him. It was reported that many messengers from the West are on the way to the
fair which is now being held in your parts. She requested to be allowed to set out with a
letter from me. Under these circumstances I have written this letter, begging your piety to
take care of a noble girl, and charge some respectable person to communicate with mariners,
pilots, and merchants, and commit her to the care of trusty men who may be able to restore
her to her father. There is no doubt that those who, when all hope of recovery has been lost,
bring the daughter to the father, will be abundantly rewarded.</p>

<p>Your fortitude rouses universal admiration, tempered as it is by gentleness and meekness,
and exhibited to your household in kindliness, to your foes in boldness. These qualities indicate
an admirable general. In a soldier’s character the main ornament is bravery, but in a
commander prudence takes precedence of bravery; after these come self-control and fairness,
whereby a wealth of virtue is gathered. Such wealth is the reward of the soul which reaches
after good, and with its eyes fixed on the sweetness of the fruit, deems the toil right pleasant.
For to virtue’s athletes the God of all, like some great giver of games, has offered prizes,
some in this life, and some in that life beyond which has no end. Those in this present life
your excellency has already enjoyed, and you have achieved the highest honour. Be it also
the lot of your greatness to obtain too those abiding and perpetual blessings, and to receive
not only the consul’s robe, but also the garment that is indescribable and divine. Of all them
that understand the greatness of that gift this is the common petition.</p>

<p>At the time when men were whelmed in the darkness of ignorance, all did not keep the
same feasts, but celebrated distinct ceremonies in different cities. In Ælis were the Olympian
games, at Delphi the Pythian, at Sparta the Hyacinthian, at Athens the Panathenaic, the
Thesmophoria, and the Dionysian. These were the most remarkable, and further some men
celebrated the revel feast of some dæmons and some of others. But now that those mists
have been scattered by intellectual light, in every land and sea mainlanders and islanders
together keep the feast of our God and Saviour, and whithersoever any one may wish to
travel abroad, journey he either towards rising or towards setting sun, everywhere he will
find the same celebration observed at the same time. There is no longer necessity, in obedience
to the law of Moses which was adapted to the infirmity of the Jews, to come together
into one city and keep the feast in memory of our blessings, but every town, every village,
the country and the farthest frontiers, are filled with the grace of God, and in every spot divine
shrines and precincts are consecrated to the God of all. So through every town we observe
our several festivals and communicate with one another in the feast. It is the same God and
Lord who is honoured in our hymns and to whom our mystic sacrifices are offered. On this
account, as is well known, we neighbours address one another by letter and signify the joy
that comes to us in the feast. So now do I to you and offer the festal salutation to your excellency.
You will without doubt reply and honour the custom of the feast.</p>

<head>LXXV. To the Clergy of Beroea.</head>
<p>I perceive that it is with reason that I am well disposed to your reverences, for I have
been assured by your kindly letter that my affection was returned. For this affection of mine
towards you I have many reasons. First of all there is the fact that your father, that great and
apostolic man, was my father too. Secondly I look upon that truly religious bishop,1720 who
now rules your church, as I might on a brother both in blood and in sympathy. Thirdly
there is the near neighbourhood of our cities, and fourthly our frequent intercourse with
one another, which naturally begets friendship and increases it when it is begotten. If you
like, I will name yet a fifth, and that is that we have the same close connexion with you as
the tongue has with the ears, the former uttering speech, and the latter receiving it; for you
most gladly listen to my words, and I am delighted to let fall my little drop upon you. But
the colophon1721 of our union is our harmony in faith; our refusal to accept any spurious
doctrines; our preservation of the ancient and apostolic teaching, which has been brought
to you by hoary wisdom and nurtured by virtue’s hardy toil. I beseech you therefore to take
greater care of the flock, to preserve it unharmed for the Shepherd, and boldly to utter the
famous words of the patriarch “that which was born of beasts I offered not unto Thee.”1722

<head>LXXVI. To Uranius, Governor of Cyprus.</head>
<p>True friendship is strengthened by intercourse, but separation cannot sunder it, for its
bonds are strong. This truth might easily be shewn by many other examples, but it is enough
for us to verify what I say by our own case. Between me and you are indeed many things,
mountains, cities, and the sea, yet nothing has destroyed my recollection of your excellency.
No sooner do we behold any one arriving from those towns which lie on the coast, than the
conversation is turned on Cyprus and on its right worthy governor, and we are delighted
to have tidings of your high repute. And lately we have been gratified to an unusual degree
at learning the most delightful news of all: for what, most excellent sir, can be more pleasing
to us than to see your noble soul illuminated by the light of knowledge? For we think it right
that he who is adorned with many kinds of virtue should add to them also its colophon, and
we believe that we shall behold what we desire. For your nobility will doubtless eagerly seize
the God-given boon, moved thereto by true friends who clearly understand its value, and
guided to the bountiful God “Who wills all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth,”1723 netting men by men’s means to salvation, and bringing them that He
captures to the ageless life. The fisherman indeed deprives his prey of life, but our Fisher
frees all that He takes alive from death’s painful bonds, and therefore “did he shew himself
upon earth, and conversed with men,”1724 bringing men His life, conveying teaching by
means of the visible manhood, and giving to reasonable beings the law of a suitable life and
conversation. This law He has confirmed by miracles, and by the death of the flesh has
destroyed death. By raising the flesh He has given the promise of resurrection to us all, after
giving the resurrection of His own precious body as a worthy pledge of ours. So loved He
men even when they hated Him that the mystery of the oeconomy fails to obtain credence
with some on account of the very bitterness of His sufferings, and it is enough to show the
depths of His loving kindness that He is even yet day by day calling to men who do not believe.
And He does so not as though He were in need of the service of men,—for of what is
the Creator of the universe in want?—but because He thirsts for the salvation of every man.
Grasp then, my excellent friend, His gift; sing praises to the Giver, and procure for us a very
great and right goodly feast.</p>

<head>LXXVII. To Eulalius, Bishop of Persian Armenia.1725</head>
<p>I know that Satan has sought to sift you as wheat,1726 and that the Lord has allowed
him so to do that He may shew the wheat, and prove the gold, crown the athletes, and proclaim
the victors’ names. Nevertheless I fear and tremble, not indeed distressed for the sake
of you who are noble champions of the truth, but because I know that it comes to pass that
some men are of feebler heart. If among twelve apostles one was found a traitor, there is no
doubt that among a number many times as great any one might easily discover many falling
short of perfection. Thus reflecting I have been confounded and filled with much discouragement,
for, as says the divine Apostle, “whether one member suffer all the members suffer
with it.”1727 We are members one of another,”1728 and form one body, having the Lord
Christ for head.”1729 Yet one consolation I have in my anxiety, when I bethink me of your
holiness. For brought up as you have been in the divine oracles, and taught by the archshepherd
what are the good shepherd’s marks, there is no doubt that you will lay down your
life for the sheep. For, as the Lord says, “he that is an hireling” when he sees “the wolf coming,”
“fleeth because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep,” but “the good shepherd
giveth his life for the sheep.”1730 Just so it is not in peace that the best general shews his inborn
valour, but in time of war, by at once stimulating others and himself exposing himself
to peril for his men. For it would be preposterous that he should enjoy the dignity of his
command, and, in the hour of need, run out of danger’s way. Thus the thrice blessed
prophets ever acted, making light of the safety of their bodies, and, for the sake of the Jews
who hated and rejected them, underwent all kinds of peril and toil. Of them the divine
apostle says “they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the
sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented,
of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens
and caves of the earth.”1731 Thus the divine apostles travelled preaching over all the world,
without home, bed, bedding, board, or any of the necessaries of life, but scourged, racked,
imprisoned, and undergoing countless kinds of death. And all this they underwent, not for
the sake of their friends, but voluntarily facing these perils for the sake of the men who were
persecuting them. A far stronger claim is made on you now to accept the peril at present
assailing you, for the sake of fellow-believers and brothers and children. This affection is

shown even by unreasoning animals, for sparrows may be seen fighting with all their force
in behalf of their brood, and putting out in their defence all the strength they have; other
kinds of birds moreover undergo danger for their young. But why do I speak of birds? Bears
too, and leopards, wolves, and lions, voluntarily suffer any pain for the safety of their offspring,
for instead of fleeing from the hunter they will await his attack and do battle for their
young.</p>
<p>I have adduced these instances not as though anointing your piety for endurance and
courage by the example of brute beasts, but to console myself in my despondency, and to
be assured that you will not leave Christ’s flock without a shepherd when wolves make their
attack, but will invoke the Lord of the flock to help you and will heartily do battle in its behalf.
A crisis like this proves who is a shepherd and who a hireling; who diligently feeds the flock
and who on the other hand feeds on the milk and thinks little of the safety of the sheep. “But
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with
the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it.”1732 But one thing
I do beseech your reverence, and that is to have greater heed of the unsound; and not only
to strengthen the unstable but also to raise the fallen, for shepherds by no means neglect
those of their flock who have fallen sick, but keep them apart from the rest, and try in every
possible way to restore them, and so must we do. We must make them that are slipping
stand up, and give them a helping hand and a word of encouragement. When they are bitten
we must heal them; we must not give up the attempt to save them nor leave them in the
devil’s maw. Thus ever acted the divine Apostle Paul; and when the Galatians, after receiving
the baptism of salvation, and the gift of the divine Spirit, fell away into the sickness of
Judaism, and received circumcision, he wailed and lamented more exceedingly than the
most affectionate mother, and tended them and freed them from that infirmity. We can
hear him exclaiming, “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be
formed in you.”1733 So too the teacher of the Corinthians, who had committed that abominable
fornication, he both chastised as might a father, and very skilfully treated, and after
cutting him off in the first Epistle, readmitted him in the second and says, “So that contrariwise
ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be
swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.”1734 And again, “Lest Satan should get an advantage
of us for we are not ignorant of his devices.”1735 In the same manner too those who partook
of things offered to idols he properly rebuked, suitably exhorted, and freed from their
grievous error.</p>

<p>Wherefore our Lord Jesus Christ permitted the first of the apostles, whose confession
He had fixed as a kind of groundwork and foundation of the Church, to waver to and fro,
and to deny Him, and then raised Him up again. And thus He gave us two lessons: not to
be confident in our own strength, and to strengthen the unstable. Reach out, therefore, I
beseech you, a hand to them that are fallen, “draw them out of the horrible pit, out of the
miry clay, and set their feet upon a rock,” and “put a new song into their mouth, even praise
unto our God,”1736 that their example of life may become an example of salvation, that
“many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord.”1737 Let them be prevented from
participating in the holy mysteries, but let them not be kept from the prayer of the catechumens,
nor from hearing the divine Scriptures and the exhortation of teachers,1738 and let
them be prohibited from partaking of the sacred mysteries, not till death, but during a given
time, till they recognise their ailment, covet health, and are properly contrite for having
abandoned their true Prince and deserted to a tyrant, and for having left their benefactor
and gone over to their foe.</p>
<p>The same lessons are given us by the precepts of the holy and blessed Fathers. I write
as I do, not to teach you piety, but to remind you as a brother might, knowing well that even
the best of pilots in the moment of the storm needs monition even from his men. So the
great and famous Moses, renowned throughout the world, who did those mighty works of
wonder, did not refuse the counsel of Jethro, a man still sunk in idolatrous error; for he did
not regard his impiety, but acknowledged the soundness of his advice. Moreover I implore
your piety to offer earnest prayer to God in my behalf that for the remaining days of my life
I may live in accordance with His laws.</p>

on account of the goodness of his character I have seen with great pleasure.</p>

<head>LXXVIII. To Eusebius, Bishop of Persian Armenia.</head>
<p>Whenever anything happens to the helmsman, either the officer in command at the
bows, or the seaman of highest rank, takes his place, not because he becomes a self-appointed
helmsman, but because he looks out for the safety of the ship. So again in war, when the
commander falls, the chief tribune assumes the command, not in the attempt to lay violent
hands on the place of power, but because he cares for his men. So too the thrice blessed
Timothy when sent by the divine Paul took his place.1739 It is therefore becoming to your
piety to accept the responsibilities of helmsman, of captain, of shepherd, gladly to run all
risk for the sake of the sheep of Christ, and not to leave His creatures abandoned and alone.
It is rather yours to bind up the broken, to raise up the fallen, to turn the wanderer from his
error, and keep the whole in health, and to follow the good shepherds who stand before the
folds and wage war against the wolves. Let us remember too the words of the patriarch Jacob;
“In the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from
my eyes. The rams of thy flock I have not eaten. That which was born of beasts I brought
not unto thee. I bare the loss of it. Of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day
or stolen by night.”1740 These are the marks of the shepherd; these are the laws of the tending
of the sheep. And if of brute cattle the illustrious patriarch had such care, and offered this
defence to him who trusted them to his charge, what ought not we to do who are entrusted
with the charge of reasonable sheep, and who have received this trust from the God of all,
when we remember that the Lord for them gave up His life? Who does not fear and tremble
when he hears the word of God spoken through Ezekiel? “I judge between shepherd and
sheep because ye eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool and ye feed not the
flocks.”1741 And again, “I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; when thou
speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, the same wicked man shall die in his
iniquity but his blood shall I require at thine hand.”1742 With this agree the words spoken
in parables by the Lord. “Thou wicked and slothful servant…Thou oughtest to have put my
money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received the same with
usury.”1743 Up then, I beseech you, let us fight for the Lord’s sheep. Their Lord is near. He
will certainly appear and scatter the wolves and glorify the shepherds. “The Lord is good
unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him.”1744 Let us not murmur at the
storm that has arisen for the Lord of all knoweth what is good for us. Wherefore also when

the Apostle asked for release from his trials He would not grant his supplication but said,
“My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”1745 Let us
then bravely bear the evils that befall us; it is in war that heroes are discerned; in conflicts
that athletes are crowned; in the surge of the sea that the art of the helmsman is shewn; in
the fire that the gold is tried. And let us not, I beseech you, heed only ourselves, let us rather
have forethought for the rest, and that much more for the sick than for the whole, for it is
an apostolic precept which exclaims “Comfort the feeble minded, support the weak.”1746
Let us then stretch out our hands to them that lie low, let us tend their wounds and set them
at their post to fight the devil. Nothing will so vex him as to see them fighting and smiting
again. Our Lord is full of loving-kindness. He receives the repentance of sinners. Let us hear
His own words: “As I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but
that the wicked turn from his way and live.”1747 So He prefaced His words with an oath,
and He who forbids oaths to others swore Himself to convince us how He desires our repentance
and salvation. Of this teaching the divine books, both the old and the new, are full,
and the precepts of the holy Fathers teach the same.</p>
<p>But not as though you were ignorant have I written to you; rather have I reminded you
of what you know, like those who standing safe upon the shore succour them that are tossed
by the storm, and shew them a rock, or give warning of a hidden shallow, or catch and haul
in a rope that has been thrown. “And the God of peace shall bring Satan under your feet
shortly”1748 and shall gladden our ears with news that you have passed from storm to calm,
at His word to the waves “Peace be still.”1749</p>

speak with greater boldness.1750</p>

<head>LXXIX. To Anatolius the Patrician.1751</head>
<p>The Lord God has given your excellency to us to be at the present time a source of very
great comfort, and has afforded us a meet haven for the storm. We have therefore confidence
in informing your lordship of our distress. Not long ago we acquainted your excellency that
the right honourable Count Rufus had shewn us an order written in the imperial handwriting
commanding the gallant general to provide with prudence and diligence for our residence
at Cyrus, and not to suffer us to depart to another city, on the ground that we are endeavouring
to summon synods to Antioch, and are disturbing the orthodox.1752 Now I make
known to you that in obedience to the imperial letter I have come to Cyrus. After an interval
of six or seven days they sent the devoted Euphronius, the commander, with a letter begging
me to acknowledge in writing that the imperial order had been shown me. I therefore
promised to remain in Cyrus and its adjacent district, and to tend the sheep entrusted to
my care. I therefore beseech your excellency to make exact enquiry, both whether these orders
had really been issued, and for what reason. I am indeed conscious of many other sins, but
I do not know that I have erred either against the Church of God, or against public order.
And I write as I do, not because I take it ill to have to live at Cyrus, for in truth she is dearer
to me than any of the most famous cities, because my office in her has been given me by
God. But the fact of my being bound to her not by preference but by compulsion does seem
somewhat grievous, and besides it does give a handle to the wicked to grow bold and to refuse
to obey our exhortations.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I beseech your lordship, if no order of the kind has really
been issued, to let me know; but if the letter really comes from the victorious emperor, tell
his pious majesty not readily to believe calumnies, nor give ear to accusers alone, but to
demand an account from the accused. Though really the evidence of the facts alone was
quite enough to persuade his piety that the charges against me were false. For when did I
ever make myself offensive about anything to his serene majesty or his chief officers? Or
when was I ever obnoxious to the many and illustrious owners here? It is on the contrary
well known to your excellency that I have spent a considerable portion of my ecclesiastical
revenues in erecting porticoes and baths, building bridges, and making further provision
for public objects. But if any persons take it ill that I mourn over the ruin of the churches
of Phoenicia, be it known to your lordship that it is impossible for me not to grieve when I
see the horn of the Jews exalted on high and the Christians in tears and sorrow, though they

send them to the very ends of the earth.1753 We cannot fight against the apostolic decrees,
for we remember the word of the Apostle which says, “We ought to obey God rather than
men,”1754 and more terrible to us than any of the pains of this life is the “judgment seat of
Christ”1755 the Lord, before whom we shall all stand to render an account of our words and
of our deeds. On account of that judgment seat the hardships of this present life must be
endured. For them that suffer wrong the hope of what is to come is consolation enough,

bright with piety and faith.</p>

<p>I have been much astonished that no information has been sent me by your lordship of
the plots against me. To counteract them would very likely have been a difficult matter to
any one not having the means of convicting their promoters of lies; but to give information
of what was going on needed not so much power as friendliness, and we had hoped that
when your excellency had been summoned to the imperial city, and had been chosen to
adorn the prefect’s exalted seat, every tempest of the Church would be calmed down. But
we suffer from such disturbances as we did not see even in the beginning of the dispute.
The churches of Phoenicia are in trouble; in trouble are those of Palestine, as all unanimously
report; and the distress is proved by the letters of the most pious bishops. All the saints
among us groan and every pious congregation is lamenting. While looking for a cessation
of our former troubles we have been afflicted with new ones. I myself have been forbidden
to quit the coasts of Cyrus, if the dispatch is true which has been shewn me, and which is
said to be an autograph of our victorious emperor. It runs as follows “Since so and so the
bishop of this city is continually assembling synods and this is a cause of trouble to the orthodox,
take heed with proper diligence and wisdom that he resides at Cyrus, and does not
depart from it to another city.” I have accepted the sentence, and remain still. Your lordship
can bear witness to my sentiments, for you know how on my arrival at Antioch I departed
in a hurry, on account of those who wished to detain me there. And those were unquestionably
wrong who gave both their ears to my calumniators and would not keep one for me.
Even to murderers, and to them that despoil other men’s beds, an opportunity is given of
defending themselves, and they do not receive sentence till they have been convicted in their
own presence, or have made confession of the truth of the charges on which they are indicted.
But a high priest who has held the office of bishop for five and twenty years1757 after passing
his previous life in a monastery, who has never troubled a tribunal, nor yet on any single
occasion been prosecuted by any man, is treated as a mere plaything of calumny, without
being allowed even the common privilege of grave-robbers of being questioned as to the
truth of the accusations brought against them. Yet they have done wrong; I have done no
wrong. But I am ready for even more serious troubles. Though they be ever so much annoyed
at my bewailing the calamities of Phoenicia I shall not cease so to do so long as I behold
them. The only judgment that is awful to me is the judgment of God. For them, nevertheless,
I pray that from the God of all they may obtain forgiveness; for your excellency, that you

given. We submit, for we know the reward of the wronged. I am aware however that Festus
the Procurator who was entrusted with the government of the Jews when they demanded
the death of the divine Paul, publicly replied, “It is not lawful to us Romans to deliver any
man before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer
for himself concerning the crime laid against him.”1759 Now these words were spoken by
one who was no believer in our Master, Christ, but was a slave to the errors of polytheism.
I was never asked whether I was assembling synods or not, or for what reason I was assembling
them, or what umbrage this could give, either to the Church or to the government;
yet just as though I had been a very guilty criminal I am prohibited from visiting other cities;
while to every one else every city lies open, and that not only to Arians and Eunomians, but
to Manichees and Marcionists, to them that are sick with the unsoundness of Valentinus
and Montanus, aye to pagans and Jews, while I, a foremost champion of the teaching of the
Gospels, am from every city excluded. Some however maintain that I do not adhere to it.
Then let there be a council: let there be assembled there the godly bishops who are capable
of judging: then let there be assembled those in office and in rank who have been instructed
in divine lore. Let me state what I hold, and let the judges declare what opinion is agreeable
to the teaching of the Apostles. I have not thus written from any desire to see the great city,
nor from trying to travel to any other. In fact I rather love the quiet of them whose wish is
to administer the churches in a monastic state. I should like your excellency to know that
neither in the time of the blessed and sainted Theodotus, nor in that of John of blessed
memory, nor in that of the very holy lord bishop Domnus, did I of my own accord enter
Antioch; five or six times I was invited but I with difficulty assented, and when I did assent
it was in obedience to the canon of the Church which orders him who is summoned to a
synod and refuses to be present to be held guilty. And when I appeared, what thing unpleasing
to God did I do? Was it that I removed from the sacred lists the names of such and such a

man guilty of unspeakable wickedness? Was it that I ordained to the priesthood men of
character and of honourable life? Was it that I preached the gospel to the people? If these
things are worthy of indictment and punishment, I gladly welcome yet severer punishments
for their sake. My accusers compel me to speak. Even before my conception my parents
promised to devote me to God; from my swaddling-band, they devoted me according to
their promise and educated me accordingly; the time before my episcopate I spent in a
monastery and then was unwillingly consecrated1760 bishop. Five and twenty years I so
lived that I was never summoned to trial by any one nor ever brought accusation against
any. Not one of the pious clergy who were under me ever frequented a court. In so many
years I never took an obol nor a garment from any one. Not one of my domestics ever received
a loaf or an egg. I could not endure the thought of possessing anything save the rags
I wore. From the revenues of my see I erected public porticoes; I built two large bridges; I
looked after the public baths. On finding that the city was not watered by the river running
by it, I built the conduit, and supplied the dry town with water. But not to mention these
matters I led eight villages of Marcionists with their neighbourhood into the way of truth;
another full of Eunomians and another of Arians I brought to the light of divine knowledge,
and, by God’s grace, not a tare of heresy was left among us. All this I did not effect with
impunity; many a time I shed my blood; many a time was I stoned by them and brought to
the very gates of death. But I am a fool in my boasting, yet my words are spoken of necessity,
not of consent. Once the thrice blessed Paul was compelled to act in the same way to stop
the mouths of his accusers. Yet I put up with seeming ignominy and count it high honour,
for I hear the voice of the Apostle crying, “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.”1761</p>
<p>But I beseech your excellency to give heed to the affairs of the Church, and calm the
storm that has arisen, for in fact not even at the beginning of the dispute was the Church
beset by such confusion. No one informs you of the greatness of the peril, of the lamentations
of the Christians in Phoenicia and of the wails of our holiest monks. Wherefore I have
written to you at some length, that on learning the agitation of the Church your excellency
might stay it, and reap the fruits of the benefit which such action will produce.</p>

<head>LXXXII. To Eusebius, Bishop of Ancyra.1762</head>
<p>I had hoped at this time to hear frequently from your holiness. Suffering as I do under
charges which are plain calumny I stand in need of brotherly consolation. For they who are
now renewing the heresy of Marcion, Valentinus, Manes, and of the other Docetæ, annoyed
at my publicly pillorying their heresy, have endeavoured to deceive the imperial ears, by
calling me a heretic and falsely accusing me of dividing into two sons our one Lord Jesus
Christ, the divine Word made man. Their utterances did not meet with the success that they
expected. A despatch was therefore written to the right honourable and glorious commander
and consul, containing indeed no accusation of heresy, but certain other charges no less
unfounded. They alleged that I was endeavouring to assemble frequent synods at Antioch;
that certain persons thereupon took umbrage; that for this reason I ought to desist from
these proceedings and manage the churches entrusted to my charge. When this communication
was shewn me I caught at the sentence as an opportunity of good. For in the first place
I gained the rest I so much longed for; furthermore I trust in the wiping out of the stains of
the many errors I have committed, on account of the wrong devised against me by the enemies
of truth. Even in this present life our supreme Ruler very plainly shews us what care
He takes of them that suffer wrong. While I have been remaining at rest, prisoned within
the boundaries of my own country; while throughout the East all men have been distressed
and have been bitterly lamenting though compelled to silence by the terror that has fallen
on them (for what has befallen me has stricken terror into the hearts of all) the Lord has
stooped from heaven, has convicted my calumniators of their falsehood, and laid bare their
impious intent. They armed even Alexandria against me and by means of their worthy instruments
are dinning into all men’s ears that I am preaching two sons instead of one.</p>
<p>I, on the contrary, am so far from holding this abominable opinion, that, on finding
some of the holy fathers of the Nicene Council opposing in their treatises the madness of
Arius and forced in their struggle against their opponents to make too marked a distinction,
I have objected, and refused to admit such distinction, for I know how the exigencies of the
distinction result in exaggeration.</p>
<p>And lest any one should suppose that I am speaking as I do through fear, let any one
who likes get hold of my ancient writings written before the Council of Ephesus, and those
written after it twelve years ago. For by God’s grace I interpreted all the Prophets and the
Psalms and the Apostles: I wrote long ago against the Arians, the Macedonians, the sophistry
of Apollinarius and the madness of Marcion: and in every one of my books by God’s grace
the mind of the Church shines clear. Moreover I have written a book on the Mysteries, an-

other on Providence, another on the Questions of the Magi, a life of the Saints, and besides
these, not to name every one in detail, many more.1763</p>
<p>I have enumerated them not for ambition’s sake, but to challenge my accusers and my
judges to put any of my writings they may choose to the test. They will find that by God’s
grace I hold no other opinion than just that which I have received from holy Scripture.</p>
<p>When, then, your holiness has heard this from me, I beg you to inform the ignorant
and to persuade the unbridled tongues that revile me and all who are deceived by them, not
to believe what they have heard of me from my calumniators. Beg them to believe rather
the Lawgiver when he exclaims “Men shall not receive a false report.”1764 Ask them to wait
till the facts are proved.</p>
<p>My prayer is that the churches may enjoy a calm and that this long and painful storm
may vanish away. But if the multitude of our sins suffer not this to come to pass; if for their
sakes we are delivered to the sifter; we pray that we may share the perils undergone for the
faith, in order that since we have not the confidence that comes from this life, at least for
guarding the faith in its integrity we may meet with pity and pardon in the day of the appearance
of the Lord. And for this we beseech your holiness to join us in our prayers.</p>

<head>LXXXIII. Of Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, to Dioscorus, Archbishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>To them that suffer under false accusation the greatest comfort is given by the words
of Scripture. When such a sufferer is wounded by the lying words of an unbridled tongue,
and feels the sharp stings of distress, he remembers the story of the admirable Joseph, and
as he beholds that model of chastity, an exemplar of every kind of virtue, suffering, under
a calumnious charge, imprisoned and fettered for invading another man’s bed, and spending
a long time in a dungeon, his pain is lightened by the remedy that the story furnishes. So
again when he finds the gentle David, hunted as a tyrant by Saul, and then catching his enemy
and letting him go unharmed, an anodyne is given him in his distress. But when he sees the
Lord Christ Himself, Maker of the ages, Creator of all things, very God, and Son of the very
God, called a gluttonous man and a wine bibber by the wicked Jews, it is not only consolation
but rather great joy that is given him in that he is deemed worthy of sharing the sufferings
of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus I was compelled to write when I read the letters of your holiness to the most pious
and sacred archbishop Domnus, for there was contained in them the statement that certain
men have come to the illustrious city administered by your holiness, and have accused me
of dividing the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons, and this when preaching at Antioch,
where innumerable hearers swell the congregation. I wept for the men who had the hardihood
to contrive the vain calumny against me. But I grieved, and, my Lord, forgive me, forced as
I am by pain to speak, that your pious excellency did not reserve one ear unbiassed for me
instead of believing the lies of my accusers. Yet they were but three or four or about a dozen
while I have countless hearers to testify to the orthodoxy of my teaching. Six years I continued
teaching in the time of Theodotus bishop of Antioch, of blessed and sacred memory, who
was famous alike for his distinguished career and for his knowledge of the divine doctrines.
Thirteen years I taught in the time of bishop John of sacred and blessed memory, who was
so delighted at my discourses as to raise both his hands and again and again to start up: your
holiness in your own letters has borne witness how, brought up as he was from boyhood
with the divine oracles, the knowledge which he had of the divine doctrines was most exact.
Besides these this is the seventh year of the most pious lord archbishop Domnus.1765 Up to
this present day, after the lapse of so long a time, not one of the pious bishops, not one of
the devout clergy has ever at any time found any fault with my utterances. And with how
much gratification Christian people hear our discourses your godly excellency can easily
learn, alike from those who have travelled thence hither, and from those who reached your
city from us.</p>
<p>All this I say not for the sake of boasting, but because I am forced to defend myself. It
is not the fame of my sermons to which I am calling attention; it is their orthodoxy alone.

Even the great teacher of the world who is wont to style himself last of saints and first of
sinners, that he might stop the mouths of liars was compelled to set forth a list of his own
labours; and in shewing that this account of his sufferings was of necessity, not of free will,
he added “I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me.”1766 I own myself
wretched—aye thrice wretched. I am guilty of many errors. Through faith alone I look for
finding some mercy in the day of the Lord’s appearing. I wish and I pray that I may follow
the footprints of the holy Fathers, and I earnestly desire to keep undefiled the evangelic
teaching which was in sum delivered to us by the holy Fathers assembled in council at the
Bithynian Nicæa. I believe that there is one God the Father and one Holy Ghost proceeding
from the Father:1767 so also that there is one Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son of God,
begotten of the Father before all ages, brightness of His glory and express image of the
Father’s person,1768 on account of man’s salvation, incarnate and made man and born of
Mary the Virgin in the flesh. For so are we taught by the wise Paul “Whose are the Fathers
and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.
Amen,”1769 and again “Concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according
to the spirit of holiness.”1770 On this account we also call the holy Virgin “Theotokos,”1771
and deem those who object to this appellation to be alienated from true religion.</p>
<p>In the same manner we call those men corrupt and exclude them from the assembly of
the Christians, who divide our one Lord Jesus Christ into two persons or two sons or two
Lords, for we have heard the very divine Paul saying “One Lord, one faith, one baptism”1772
and again “One Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things”1773 and again “Jesus Christ the
same yesterday and to-day and for ever”1774 and in another place—“He that descended is
the same also that ascended up far above all heavens.”1775 And countless other passages of
this kind may be found in the Apostle’s writings, proclaiming the one Lord.</p>

<p>So too the divine Evangelist exclaims, “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
us and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth.”1776</p>
<p>And his namesake exclaimed, “After me cometh one who is preferred before me for He
was before me.”1777 And when he had shewn one person, he expressed both the divine and
the human, for the words “man” and “comes” are human, but the phrase “He was before
me” expresses the divine. But nevertheless he did not recognise a distinction between Him
who came after and Him who was before, but owned the same being to be eternal as God,
but born man, after himself, of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Thus too, the thrice blessed Thomas, when he had put his hand on the flesh of the Lord,
called Him Lord and God, saying “My Lord and my God.”1778 For through the visible nature
he discerned the invisible.</p>
<p>So do we know no difference between the same flesh and the Godhead but we own God
the Word made man to be one Son.</p>
<p>These lessons we have learnt alike from the holy Scripture and from the holy Fathers
who have expounded it, Alexander and Athanasius, loud voiced heralds of the truth, who
have been ornaments of your apostolic see; from Basil and from Gregory and the rest of the
lights of the world; and that, in our endeavour to shut the mouths of them that dare to oppose
the blessed Theophilus and Cyril, we use their works, our own writings testify. For we are
most anxious by the medicines supplied by very holy men to heal them that deny the distinction
between the Lord’s flesh and the Godhead, and who maintain at one moment that
the divine nature was changed into flesh, and at another that the flesh was transmuted into
nature of Godhead.</p>
<p>For they clearly instruct us in the distinction between the two natures, and proclaim
the immutability of the divine nature, calling the flesh of the Lord divine as being made
flesh of God the Word; but the doctrine that it was transmuted into nature of Godhead they
repudiate as impious.</p>
<p>I think that your excellency is well aware that Cyril of blessed memory often wrote to
me, and when he sent his books against Julian to Antioch, and in like manner his book on
the scapegoat, he asked the blessed John, bishop of Antioch, to shew them to the great
teachers of the East; and in compliance with this request the blessed John sent us the books.
I read them with admiration, and I wrote to Cyril of blessed memory; and he wrote back to
me praising my exactitude and kindness. This letter I have preserved.</p>

<p>That I twice subscribed the writings of John of blessed memory concerning Nestorius
my own hand bears witness, but this is the kind of thing whispered about me by men who
try to conceal their own unsoundness by calumniating me.</p>
<p>Therefore I implore your holiness to turn your back on the liars; to give heed to the
Church’s quiet and either to heal by salutary medicines them that are trying to destroy the
doctrines of the truth, or, if they refuse to accept your treatment, to expel them from the
fold, to the end that the sheep may be spared from contagion. I beg you to give me your
customary salutation. That I have written you my true sentiments is proved by my works
on the holy Scriptures and against the Arians and Eunomians.</p>
<p>I will in addition write yet a brief word. If any one refuses to confess the holy Virgin to
be “Theotokos,” or calls our Lord Jesus Christ bare man, or divides into two sons Him who
is one only begotten and first born of every creature, I pray that he may fall from hope in
Christ, and let all the people say amen, amen.</p>

cheer me by a letter in reply telling me that your holiness has turned your back on my accusers.</p>

<head>LXXXIV. To the Bishops of Cilicia.1779</head>
<p>Your piety has heard of the calumnies directed against me. The opponents of the truth
allege that I divide our one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, into two sons,
and it is said by some that a ground for their calumny is derived from a handful of men
among you who hold these opinions, and who divide God the Word made man into two
sons. They ought to listen to those words of the Apostle which openly declare “one Lord
Jesus Christ by whom are all things,”1780 and again “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.”1781
They ought to have followed the Master’s teaching, for the Lord Himself says “And no man
hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man
which is in Heaven.”1782 And again “If ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was
before.”1783 And the tradition of holy baptism teaches us that there is one Son, just as there
is one Father and one Holy Ghost. I hope then that your piety will deign, if there really are
any, though I cannot believe it, who disobey the apostolic doctrines to close their mouths,
to rebuke them as the laws of the Church require, and teach them to follow the footsteps of
the holy Fathers and preserve undefiled the faith laid down at Nicæa in Bithynia by the holy
and blessed Fathers, as summing up the teaching of Evangelists and Apostles. For it becomes
you who love God to give heed both to God’s glory and our common credit, and not to
overlook the attacks which are made upon us all through the ignorance or contentiousness
of these few men—if they really are guilty, and if they are not, like ourselves, suffering from
the whetted tongues of false accusers.</p>

<p>The chief good is said by the divine Paul to be love,1785 and by love he ordered the
nurslings of the faith to be fed. Of this love your piety possesses great wealth, and so has
told me what was befitting and given me pleasant news. For to them that fear the Lord what
can be pleasanter than the health and harmony of the doctrines of the truth? Be well assured,
most godly sir, that we were much delighted to hear the intelligence of our common friend;
and in proportion to our previous distress at hearing that he described the nature of flesh
and of Godhead as one, and openly attributed the passion of salvation to the impassible
Godhead, so were all rejoiced to read the letters of your holiness, and to learn that he
maintains in their integrity the properties of the natures and denies both the change of God
the Word into flesh, and the mutation of the flesh into the nature of Godhead, maintaining
on the contrary that in the one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Word made man, the
properties of either nature abide unconfounded. We praise the God of all for the harmony
of divine faith. We have however written to either Cilicia,1786 although our intelligence is
imperfect, as to whether there are really any opponents of the truth, and have charged the
godly bishops to search and examine if there are any who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ
into two sons, and either to bring them to their senses by admonition, or cut them off from
the roll of the brethren. For in fact we equally repudiate both those who dare to assert one
nature of flesh and Godhead, and those who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons
and strive to go beyond the definitions of the Apostles.</p>
<p>But let your holiness be well assured that we are disposed to peace. For if the prophet
says, “With them that hate peace I was peaceful,”1787 much more readily do we welcome
the peace of God.</p>
<p>Some of those men who have been fed on lies have hurried to Alexandria and patched
up calumnies against me, with the result that the godly bishop of that city, led away by their
statements, although he had been fully informed by my letters, has sent a pious bishop to
the imperial city. I beg you therefore to shew your accustomed kindness to him, and to
confront falsehood with the truth.</p>

<head>LXXXVI.1788To Flavianus, Bishop of Constantinople.</head>
<p>At the present time, most God-beloved lord, I have received many buffetings of billows,
but I called upon the great Pilot, and have been able to stand firm against the storm; the attacks,
however, now made upon me transcend every story in tragedy. In relation to the attacks
which are being plotted against the apostolic faith, I thought that I should find an ally and
fellow-worker in the most godly bishop of Alexandria, the lord Dioscorus,1789 and so sent
him one of our pious presbyters, a man of remarkable prudence, with a synodical letter informing
his piety that we abide in the agreement made in the time of Cyril of blessed memory,
and accept the letter written by him as well as that written by the very blessed and sainted
Athanasius to the blessed Epictetus, and, before these, the exposition of the faith laid down
at Nicæa in Bithynia by the holy and blessed Fathers. We exhorted him to induce those who
are unwilling to abide by these documents at once to abide by them. But one of the opposite
party, who keep up these disturbances, by tricking some of those who are on the spot and
contriving countless calumnies against myself has stirred an iniquitous agitation against
me.</p>
<p>But the very godly bishop Dioscorus has written us a letter such as never ought to have
been written by one who has learnt from the God of all not to listen to vain words. He has
believed the charges brought against me as though he had made personal enquiry into every
one of them, and had arrived at the truth after questioning, and has thus condemned me. I
however have bravely borne the calumnious charge, and have written him back a courteous
letter, representing to his piety that the whole charge is false, and that not one of the godly
bishops of the East holds opinions contrary to the apostolic decrees. Moreover the pious
clergy whom he sent as messengers have been convinced by the actual evidence of the facts.
These however he has dismissed unheeded, and, lending his ears to my calumniators, has
acted in a manner quite incredible, were it not that the whole church bears witness to it. He
put up with them that were crying Anathema against me; nay he stood up in his place and
confirmed their words by adding his voice to theirs. Besides all this he sent certain godly
bishops to the imperial city, as we learnt, in the hope of increasing the agitation against me.
I in the first place have for champion Him who seeth all things, for it is on behalf of the divine
decrees that I am wrestling—next after Him I invoke your holiness to fight in defence of
the faith that is attacked, and do battle on behalf of the canons that are being trodden under

foot. When the blessed Fathers were assembled in that imperial city1790 in harmony with
them that had sat in council at Nicæa, they distinguished the dioceses, and assigned to each
diocese the management of its own affairs, expressly enjoining that none should intrude
from one diocese into another. They ordered that the bishop of Alexandria should administer
the government of Egypt alone, and every diocese its own affairs.1791</p>
<p>Dioscorus, however, refuses to abide by these decisions; he is turning the see of the
blessed Mark upside down; and these things he does though he perfectly well knows that
the Antiochene metropolis possesses the throne of the great Peter, who was teacher of the
blessed Mark, and first and coryphæus of the chorus of the apostles.1792</p>
<p>But I know the majesty of the see, and I know and take measure of myself. I have learnt
from the first the humility of the Apostles. I beseech your holiness not to overlook the
trampling underfoot of the holy canons, and to stand forward zealously as champion of the
divine faith, for in that faith we have hope of our salvation and on its account are confident
that we shall meet with mercy.</p>
<p>But that your holiness may not be ignorant of this, know, my lord, that he shewed his
ill-will towards me from the time of my assenting, in obedience to the canons of the holy
Fathers, to the synodical letters issued in your see in the time of Proclus of blessed memory;
on this point he has chidden me once and again on the ground of my violating the rights
of the church of Antioch and, as he says, of that of Alexandria. Remembering this, and
finding, as he thinks, an opportunity, he has exhibited his hostility. But nothing is stronger
than the truth. Truth is wont to conquer even with few words. I beseech your holiness to
remember me in your prayers to the Lord that I may have power to prevail against the waves
that are beating me hither and thither.</p>

<head>LXXXVII. To Domnus, Bishop of Apamea.1793</head>
<p>The law of brotherly love demanded that I should receive many letters from your godliness
at this time. For the divine Apostle charges us to weep with them that weep and rejoice
with them that do rejoice.1794 I have not received a single one, although just lately I was
visited by some of the pious monks of your monastery with the pious presbyter Elias. Nevertheless
I have written, and I salute your holiness; and I make you acquainted with the fact
that the consolation of the Master has stood me in stead of all other, for in truth not even
had I as many mouths as I have hairs on my head, could I worthily praise Him for my being
deemed worthy of suffering on account of my confession of Him, and for the apparent disgrace
which I hold more august than any honour. And if I be banished to the uttermost
parts of the earth all the more will I praise Him as being counted worthy of greater blessings.
Nevertheless I hope your holiness will put up prayers for the quiet of the holy churches. It
is because of the storm that is assailing them that I wail and groan and lament. That quiet,
as I know, was driven away by the Osrhoene clergy,1795 who poured out countless words
against me, although I had no share in their condemnation, nor in the sentence passed upon
them; on the contrary, as your holiness knows, I besought that the communion might be
given to them at Easter. But slanderers find no difficulty in saying what they like. My consolation
lies in the blessing of the Master who said, “Blessed are ye when men shall revile
you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice
and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the
prophets which were before you.”1796</p>

<p>Slanderers have forced me to go beyond the bounds of moderation, and compel me to
write to you who have adorned the highest offices, and obtained the most distinguished
honours. I therefore implore you to pardon me, for I do not write in self sufficiency, but
because I am thrust forward by necessity. It is not because I expect to fall unjustly into
trouble and distress, for this is the common fate of all who have sincerely served God, but
because I desire to persuade your excellency that those who accuse my opinions are producing
false charges against me. From my mother’s breast I have been nurtured on apostolic
teaching, and the creed laid down at Nicæa by the holy and blessed Fathers I have both
learnt and teach. All who hold any other opinion I charge with impiety, and if any one persists
in asserting that I teach the contrary, let him not bring a charge which I cannot defend, but
convict me to my face. For this is agreeable to the laws alike of God and of man, but to whom
is it so becoming to champion the wronged as to you, O friend of Christ, to whom boldness
of utterance is given by the splendour of your lineage, the greatness of your rank and your
foremost place in the law?</p>

<p>In sending a letter to your greatness I am daring what is beyond me, but the cause of
my daring is not self-confidence, but the slanders of my calumniators. I have thought it well
worth while to instruct your righteous ears how openly the impugners of my opinions are
calumniating me. I have been guilty, I own, of many errors, but up to now I have ever kept
the faith of the apostles undefiled, and on this account alone I have cherished the hope that
I shall meet with mercy on the day of the Lord’s appearing. On behalf of this faith I continue
to contend against every kind of heresy; this faith I am ever giving to the nurslings of piety;
by means of this faith I have metamorphosed countless wolves into sheep, and have brought
them to the Saviour who is the Arch-shepherd of us all. So have I learnt not only from the
apostles and prophets but also from the interpreters of their writings, Ignatius, Eustathius,
Athanasius, Basil, Gregory, John, and the rest of the lights of the world; and before these
from the holy Fathers in council at Nicæa, whose confession of the faith I preserve in its
integrity, like an ancestral inheritance, styling corrupt and enemies of the truth all who dare
to transgress its decrees. I invoke your greatness, now that you have heard from me in these
terms, to shut the mouths of my calumniators. It is in my opinion wholly unreasonable to
accept as true what is charged against men in their absence; rather is it lawful and right that
those who wish to appear as prosecutors should accuse the defendants in their presence,
and endeavour to convict them face to face. Under these conditions the judges will without
difficulty be able to arrive at the truth.</p>

<head>XC. To Lupicinus the Master.1799</head>
<p>I have passed through the contests of my prime. I see before me the confines of old age,
and have expected as an old man to have more honour given me. But I am a mark for the
shafts of slander, and am driven to meet by defence accusations levelled against me. Under
these circumstances, I beseech your excellency not to believe the lies of my accusers. Had I
been living a life of silence, there might have been room for the suspicion of unorthodoxy.
But I am continually discoursing in the churches, and therefore have, by God’s grace, innumerable
witnesses to the soundness of what I teach. I follow the laws and rules of the apostles.
I test my teaching by applying to it, like a rule and measure, the faith laid down by the holy
and blessed Fathers at Nicæa. If any one maintain that I hold any contrary opinion, let him
accuse me face to face; let him not slander me in my absence. It is fair that even the defendant
should have an opportunity of speech, and meet with his defence the charges brought against
him, and that then and not till then should the judges lawfully pronounce their sentence.
This favour I beg through your excellency’s assistance. If any men wish to condemn me
unheard, I accept with willingness even their unjust sentence. For I wait for the judgment
of the Master, where we need neither witnesses nor accusers. Before Him, as says the divine
Apostle, “all things are naked and opened.”1800</p>

<p>I well know, and need no words to tell me, how your excellency regards me. Actions
speak more clearly than words, but I have been anxious for you to know the cause of the
accusation that is brought against me. For I am suffering under a most extraordinary charge,
being at one and the same time attacked as unmarried, and as having been married twice.1802
If my present calumniators assert that I am falsifying the apostolic doctrine, why in the
world, instead of accusing me in my absence, do they not attempt to convict me face to face?
This fact alone is enough to give utter refutation to their lies, for it is because they know
that I have innumerable witnesses to the apostolic character of my doctrines that they have
urged an undefended indictment against me. Lawful judges must on the contrary keep one
ear unbiassed for the accused. If they give both to the pleadings of the opponents, and deliver
a sentence acceptable to them, I shall put up with the injustice as bringing me nearer to the
kingdom of heaven, and shall await that impartial tribunal, where there is neither prosecutor,
nor counsel, nor witness, nor distinction in rank, but judgment of deeds and words and
righteous retribution. “For,” it is said, “we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ

<p>I cherish an indelible memory of your magnificence, and now by very religious and holy

to the imperial city in order to put an end to the false charges raised against me. For certain

churches for whose sake the Lord Christ “endured the Cross despising the shame”;1806 in
whose behalf the band of the divine apostles and companies of victorious martyrs were delivered
to many kinds of death. On behalf of their peace I call on your magnificence to
contend. It had been easy for the God of all to have nodded His head and scattered the

<p>The loving-kindness of the Lord has already given you an opportunity of carrying out

may the more easily champion the cause of the truth that is assailed, bring lies to nought,
and give the churches the calm for which they so intensely long. Your excellency has already
learned from many other sources how great is the surge by which the churches in the East
are overwhelmed, but you will acquire more accurate information concerning it from the
very religious bishops who, on account of it, have undertaken their long journey in the
winter, relying, next after the Grace of God, on the providence of your authority. Disperse
for us, then, O Christian man, the storm, change the moonless night into clear sunshine,
and bridle the tongues set wagging against us. We by God’s grace are ever fighting for the
apostolic decrees, and we preserve undefiled the faith laid down at Nicæa, and style impious
all who dare to violate its dogmas. In evidence of the truth of what I say may be cited my
catechumens, those who are from time to time baptized by me, and the hearers of my discourses
in the churches. If they mean to accuse me in accordance with the law, they must
convict me in my presence, not slander me in my absence. In this manner your excellency,
when giving judgment in other cases, is wont to deliver your sentences, perceiving on which
side lies the right from the pleadings both of the prosecution and of the defence.</p>

calumnies against me, and under these circumstances the very religious bishops, making
light of a long journey, of infirmity, and of old age, have left their own flocks unshepherded,
and undertaken to travel this great distance, in their eagerness to confute the lies told against

<p>I have written to you two letters, indeed I think three, but without getting any answer.
I had wished to say no more, but to know my own place and the greatness of dignities, and
to beg you to inform me of the cause of your silence. Really I do not know what offence I
can have given to your excellency. We err unwillingly as well as willingly, and sometimes
are quite ignorant in what way we are transgressing. I therefore beg your greatness, remembering
the divine laws which plainly charge us “If thy brother shall trespass against thee go
and tell him his fault between him and thee alone”1810 to deign to make plain to me the
origin of the annoyance, that I may either prove myself innocent, or, made aware of where
I was wrong, may beg your pardon. In my confidence in the evidence of my conscience I
hope for the former. All men are adorned by magnanimity, and not least those who, following
the example of your excellency, trained in outside education as well as instructed in divine
principles, both hear the apostolic laws loudly exclaiming “Let not the sun go down upon
your wrath”1811 and remember the words of Homer1812
<lg>
<l>“In fit bounds contain thy mighty mind;</l>
<l>Benignity is best.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>I have thus written not as though giving you information, but to remind one who is
much occupied, and I do so in remembrance of the law of the Lord, who says “Therefore if
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against
thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother
and then come and offer thy gift.”1813 In obedience to these words I have thought it right

in religion, and your real goodwill to me. On hearing of this as well as of the efforts of
the glorious and pious lord Patricius1815 on my behalf I give you the apostolic blessing which
the blessed Onesiphorus obtained from that holy tongue; “The Lord give mercy to your
house, for he oft refreshed. me and was not ashamed of my chain;” “The Lord grant unto
him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.”1816 This I pray for you, even though
the enemies of the truth inflict on me yet greater miseries as they suppose; for we have been
taught to regard men’s purpose; but be sure of this, that with true religion death to me is
very pleasant, and exile to the ends of the earth. Still we are distressed at the storm of the

church, when I have proclaimed the Lord Jesus, and have pointed out the properties alike
of the Godhead and of the manhood; for we do not divide one Son into two, but, worshipping
the Only-begotten, point out the distinction between flesh and Godhead. This, indeed, is I
think confessed even by the Arians, who do not call the flesh Godhead, nor address the
Godhead as flesh. Holy Scripture clearly teaches us both natures. Nevertheless, though I
have ever thus spoken, certain men are uttering lying words against me. But I rely on my
conscience and have as witness to my teaching Him who looks into the hearts. So, as the
prophet says, I regard the contrivances of calumny as “a spider’s web.”1819 I await the great
judgment which needs no words, but makes manifest what in the meanwhile is unknown.</p>
<p>I send this by the very religious bishops, thinking it worth while to salute your excellency

I assert that He is God eternal, who was made man at the end of days, not by the change of
the Godhead, but by the assumption of the manhood. It is however needless for me to inform
your piety of my sentiments, for you have exact knowledge of what I preach, and how I instruct

upon all the godly bishops of the East at once, and overwhelmed the churches with a storm,
that your piety will show all possible zeal on behalf of the doctrines of the gospel and the

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the reproaches that are directed against me being heard
in silence by men who do not know me; but that your holiness should not refute the lies of
my revilers, or at least should do so only to a certain extent, and with no great heartiness,
passes the belief of any one who knows your character and conduct. And I say this not because
friendship ought to be preferred to truth, but because the witness of truth is on the side of
friendship. Your reverence has very often heard me preaching in church, and, in other assemblies
where I have spoken on doctrinal questions; you have listened to what I have said,
and I do not know of any occasion on which you have found fault with me for expressing
unorthodox opinions. But what is the case at the present moment? Why in the world, my
dear friend, do you not utter a word against falsehood, while you allow a friend to be calumniated
and the truth to be assailed? If this is because you disregard the helpless and insignificant,
remember the plain proclamation of the commandment of the Lord “Take heed that
ye despise not one of these little ones which believe in me, for I say unto you that in heaven
their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.”1822 If however it
is the influence of my calumniators which imposes silence upon you, you must listen to the
other law which says “Thou shalt not honour the person of the mighty”1823 and “Judge
righteous judgment”1824 and “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil”1825 and “He
that shutteth his eyes from seeing evil and stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood.”1826
You may find innumerable similar passages in holy Scripture, which I have thought it
needless to collect when writing to a man brought up in the divine oracles, and watering
Christian people with his teaching. But this I will say, that we shall all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ, and shall give account of our words and deeds. I, who for every
other reason dread this tribunal, now that I am encompassed with calumny, find my chief
consolation in the thought of it.</p>

<head>CIII. To the Count Apollonius.1827</head>
<p>The very godly bishops have been led to travel to the imperial city by the calumnies
uttered against me, and I by their holinesses send your excellency my salutation, and pay
the debt of friendship, not indeed to wipe out the cherished obligation, but to make it
greater. For in truth the obligations of friendship are increased by their discharge. That I
should now be reaping the fruits of calumny is not extraordinary, for, in that I am human,
there is nothing that I must not expect. All troubles of this kind must be borne by them that
have learned wisdom; one thing only is distressing—that harm should accrue to the soul.</p>

<head>CIV. To Flavianus,1828Bishop of Constantinople.</head>
<p>I have already in another letter informed your holiness how openly the calumniators
of our teaching are slandering us.1829 Now in like manner by means of the very godly
bishops I do the same, having not only these as witnesses of the orthodoxy of my teaching
but also countless other men who are my hearers in the churches of the East. Above and
beyond all these I have my conscience, and Him who sees my conscience. And I know too
how the divine Apostle often appealed to the testimony of his conscience, for “our rejoicing
is this, the testimony of our conscience”1830 and again “I say the truth in Christ I lie not,
my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.”1831 Know then, O holy and
godly sir, that no one has ever at any time heard us preaching two sons; in fact this doctrine
seems to me abominable and impious, for there is one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are
all things. Him I acknowledge both as everlasting God and as man in the end of days, and
I give Him one worship as only begotten. I have learned however the distinction between
flesh and Godhead, for the union is unconfounded. Thus drawn up as it were in battle array
to oppose the madness of Arius and Eunomius, we very easily refute the blasphemy hazarded
by them against the only begotten, by applying what was spoken in humility about the Lord,
and suitably to His assumed nature, to man, and, on the other hand, what becomes the divine
and signifies the divine nature, to God; not dividing Him into two persons, but teaching
that both the former and latter attributes belong to the only begotten, the latter to Him as
God the Creator and Lord of all, and the former as made man on our account. For divine
Scripture says that He was made man, not by mutation of the Godhead, but by assumption
of human nature, of the seed of Abraham. This the divine Apostle openly says in the words
“For verily He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham,
wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren.”1832 And
again “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made: he saith not and to seeds, as
of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.”1833</p>
<p>These and similar passages have been cut out of divine Scripture by Simon, Basilides,
Valentinus, Bardesanes, Marcion, and the man who is named after his maniacal heresy.1834
So they style the Master Christ God only, and describe Him as having nothing human about

Him, but appearing in imagination and appearance as man to men. On the other hand the
Arians and Eunomians say that God the Word assumed only a body, and that He Himself
supplied the place of a soul in the body. And Apollinarius describes the Master’s body as
endued with a soul;1835 but, deriving, I know not whence, the idea of a distinction between
soul and intelligence,1836 deprives intelligence of its share in the achieved salvation.1837 The
teaching of the divine Apostles lays down on the contrary that a soul both reasonable and
intelligent was assumed together with flesh, and the salvation of which the hope is held out
to them that believe is complete.</p>
<p>There is yet another gang of heretics who hold differently. Photinus,1838 Marcellus,1839
and Paul of Samosata,1840 assert that our Lord and God was only man. When arguing with
these we are under the necessity of advancing proofs of the Godhead, and of shewing that
the Master Christ is everlasting God. When, on the other hand, we are contending with the
former faction, which calls our Lord Jesus Christ God only, we are obliged to marshal against
them the forces of the divine Scripture, and collect from it evidence of the assumption of
the manhood. For a physician must use remedies appropriate to the disease, and suit the
medicine to the case.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I beseech your holiness to scatter the slander raised against me, and
bridle the tongues now vainly reviling me. For, after the incarnation, I worship one Son of
God, one Lord Jesus Christ, and denounce as impious all who hold otherwise. Deign, sir,
to give me too your holy prayers, that, by God’s grace, I may reach the other side of the
ocean of danger, and drop my anchor in the windless haven of the Lord.</p>

he shall bring it to pass; and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy

For the great care you bestow upon them that are weeping for their orphanhood, and your
struggles on behalf of the apostolic doctrines, are in every one’s mouth, and so, as the
prophets say, “Hidden things are made manifest.” Since I too have heard of your piety’s
admirable exertions I write to salute you, most godly sir, and beseech you to increase your

<head>CIX. To Eusebius, Bishop of Ancyra.1845</head>
<p>Many are the devices secretly plotted against me, and through me patched up against
the faith of apostles. I am however comforted by the sufferings of the Saints, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and men famous in the churches in the word of Grace; and besides these
by the promises of our God and Saviour, for in this present life He has promised us nothing
pleasant or delightful, but rather trouble, toil, and peril, and attacks of enemies. “In the
world,” He says, “ye shall have tribulation,”1846 and “if they have persecuted me they will
also persecute you,”1847 and “If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how
much more shall they call them of his household,”1848 and “The time cometh when whosoever
killeth you will think he doeth God service,”1849 and “Straight is the gate and narrow
the way which leadeth unto life,”1850 and “When they persecute you in this city flee you
into another,”1851 and I might quote all similar passages. The divine Apostle too speaks in
the same strain. “Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, but
evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.”1852 These
words give me the greatest comfort in this distress. As the calumnies uttered against me
have probably reached your holiness’s ears, I beseech your holiness to give no credence to
the lies of my slanderers. I am not aware of ever having taught anyone up to the present
time to believe in two sons. I have been taught to believe in one only begotten, our Lord Jesus
Christ, God the Word made man. But I know the distinction between flesh and Godhead,
and regard as impious all who divide our one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons, as well as
those who, travelling in an opposite direction, call the Godhead and manhood of the master
Christ one nature. For these exaggerations stand opposed to one another, while between
them lies the way of the doctrines of the Gospel, beautified by the footprints of prophets
and apostles, and of all who after them have been conspicuous for the gift of teaching. I was
anxious to adduce their opinions, and to point out how they bear witness in favour of my
own, but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have written summarily
what I have been taught about the incarnation of the only begotten; I send my statement
to your godly excellency.1853 I have written not with the object of teaching others, but

sentiments to those who are ignorant of them. After your holiness has read what I have
written, if you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you will confirm
my opinion by what you reply—if, on the contrary, anything that I have said jars with the
divine teaching, I request to be told of it by your holiness. For, though I have spent much
time in teaching, I still need one to teach me. “We know,” says the divine Apostle “in
part,”1854 and again he says, “If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth
nothing yet as he ought to know.”1855 So I hope that I may hear the truth from your holiness,
and that you may also give heed to the calm of the Church, and fight for the divine doctrines.

<head>CX. To Domnus, Bishop of Antioch.1857</head>
<p>When I read your letter I remembered the very blessed Susannah, who when she saw
the famous villains, and believed that the God of all was present, uttered that remarkable
cry, “I am straitened on every side;”1858 but nevertheless preferred to fall into the snares of
slander rather than to despise the just God. And I, sir, have two alternatives as I have often
said, to offend God and wound my conscience, or to fall by man’s unjust sentence. The most
pious emperor, I think, knows nothing of this. For what hindered him from writing, and
ordering the ordination to take place, if in truth it so pleased him? Why in the world do
they utter threats without and cause alarm, and yet do not send letters openly ordering it?
One of two things must be true; either the very pious emperor is not induced to write, or
they are trying to make us break the law and afterwards be indicted by them for illegality. I
have before me the example of the blessed Principius,1859 for in that case, when they had
given orders by writing, they punished him for obedience. Moreover the letters which I read
on the very day of the letter-bearer’s arrival are of a contrary tenour. For one of the holy
monks has written to some one that he has received letters both from the very illustrious
guardsman and the very glorious ex-magister stating that the case of the very godly lord
bishop Irenæus will stand more favourably, and in return for this good will they ask prayers
on their behalf. I think therefore that a reply ought to be written to the clergy who have
written from the imperial city to the effect that1860 “in obedience to the sentence of the very
godly bishops of Phoenicia, and knowing both the zeal and the magnanimity and love for
the poor and all the other virtues of the very godly bishop Irenæus, and in addition to this
the orthodoxy of his opinions, I have ordained him. I am not aware that he has ever objected
to apply to the holy Virgin the title ‘Theotokos,’ or has ever held any other opinions contrary
to the doctrines of the Gospel. As to the question of digamy, I have followed my predecessors;
for Alexander of blessed and sacred memory, the ornament of this apostolic see, as well as

October 447, and to the deposition of Irenæus of Tyre, for which the formal edict was issued in Feb. 448, but
which was perhaps rumoured earlier. But by some the death of Proclus is placed a year earlier.</note>

led some to suppose that Theodoret, who belonged to another province, was the consecrator of Irenæus, or that
he took part in his consecration, or even with the Abbé Martin (le Pseudo-Synode d’Éphèse, pp. 84, 85) that it
is erroneously ascribed to Theodoret, and was really written by Domnus. It is clear from the tenor of the epistle
that it was written by Theodoret, and that the first person is employed by him as writing in Domnus’ name.
(Tillemont xv. pp. 871, 872.)” Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 281 n. It is in consonance with this theory that Alexander of
Antioch is described as bishop of this apostolic see, a phrase natural for Domnus to use, but not for Theodoret.</note>

the very blessed Acacius, bishop of Beroea, ordained Diogenes of blessed memory who was
a ‘digamus;’1861 and similarly the blessed Praylius ordained Domninus of Cæsarea who was
a ‘digamus.’1862 We have therefore followed precedent, and the example of men well known
and illustrious both for learning and character. Proclus, bishop of Constantinople, of blessed
memory well aware of this and many other instances, both himself accepted the ordination,
and wrote in praise and admiration of it. So too did the leading godly bishops of the Pontic
Diocese,1863 and all the Palestinians.</p>
<p>“No doubt has been raised about the matter, and we hold it wrong to condemn a man
illustrious for many and various noble actions.” In my opinion it is becoming to write in
these terms. If your holiness holds any other view, let what seems good to you be done. I,
as they suppose, have undergone one punishment, and am ready by God’s help to undergo
yet another. Even a third and fourth, if they like, by the stay of God’s grace I will endure,
praising the Lord. If your holiness thinks right, let us see what answer comes from Palestine,
and, after considering more exactly what course is to be taken, let us so write to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Your excellency will be recompensed for the kindness you have shewn me by the God
of all, for all that is done for His sake has its reward. I laugh at all my slanderers. The bodies
of them who are most severely scourged do not feel the pain, because the scourged flesh is
deadened. Still I lament over them whose unrestrained mouths utter such lies. In what way
have the accusers of the godly bishop Ibas1865 been wronged by me that they should utter
such calumnies against me? To begin with, I was not even one of the judges, for in obedience
to the imperial decree I was living at Cyrus. Moreover, as I have heard from many, they all
along treated my absence as a grievance, for I had arranged for their partaking of the Holy
Communion at the Easter feast of salvation,1866 and as they often expressed a wish to meet
me, I received them with kindness and advised them as to the proper course to take. But
that I may also speak in the defence of the very godly bishop the lord Domnus, what was
the proper course for him to take? He was openly attacked; he saw men deposed by a synodical
sentence sent into another diocese, and resuming their priestly functions in violation
of the laws of the Church; he saw things holy and divine laughed at and turned into ridicule
by the enemies of the Church; what was he to do? When he knew this he handed over the
case to others, and not only to the very godly lord Ibas, but also to the holy lord bishop Symeon
of Amida, that the metropolitans of the two provinces might hear the charges. What
fairness is there in charging the same persons with cruelty and kindness? If we excommunicate,
we run into danger; if we do not excommunicate, we do not escape it. We alone of
all the world are objects of attack. Other dioceses are at peace. We alone are exposed to calumniators,—
specially I myself, though I took no part in the trial, and am absolutely without
responsibility in the matter.</p>
<p>Thus have I been forced to write on reading your lordship’s letter, and on learning from
it how for these reasons a great commotion has been made against me, a man confined to
my diocese; a man of peace; one not even deliberating with the godly bishops of the province.
As a matter of fact, although there have been already two episcopal ordinations in our
province, I took part in neither. Were I not restrained by the imperial decree I would have
gone away, and spent the remainder of my days in some remote spot. I am faint for the plots

<head>CXII. To Domnus, Bishop of Antioch.1868</head>
<p>When news was brought to me that the pettiness of the victorious emperor had been
put an end to, a reconciliation effected between him and the very godly bishop,1869 the
summons to the council cancelled, and the peace of the churches restored, I hoped that our
troubles were a thing of the past. But I am deeply distressed at what I hear from your holiness.
It is impossible to hope for any good from this notorious council, unless the merciful Master
with His wonted providence shall undo the riotous demons’ devices. Even in the great synod,
I mean that of Nicæa, the Arian party voted with the orthodox and set their hands to the
apostolic exposition. But they did not cease to war against the truth till they had torn asunder
the body of the Church. For thirty years the supporters of the apostolic doctrines and they
who were infected with the Arian blasphemy continued in communion with one another.
But at Antioch,1870 when the latest council was finished, when they had seated the man of
God, the great Meletius, on the apostolic throne, and then after a few days ejected him by
the imperial authority, Euzoius who was affected with the undoubted plague of Arius was
put forward, and straightway the champions of apostolic doctrines seceded and thereafter
the division continued.</p>
<p>As I look back on what happened then, and look forward to similar events in the future,
my wretched spirit sighs and wails, for I see no prospect of good. The men of the other
dioceses do not know the poison which lies in the Twelve Chapters;1871 having regard to
the celebrity of the writer of them, they suspect no mischief, and his successor in the see1872
<note type="footnote">1868 Garnerius points out that the indications of the date of this letter are clear. It mentions the imperial
summons to the Latrocinium, and contains Theodoret’s advice to Domnus as to what companions he should
take with him. It must therefore be placed between the arrival of the summons at Antioch and the departure of
Domnus for Ephesus. The summons is dated the 30th of March, and appointed the 1st of August for the meeting.
Antioch is a clear thirty days’ journey from Ephesus and Domnus had not yet chosen his companions. We may
therefore date the letter in the May of 449.</note>

twelve ‘articles’ or ‘chapters,’ couched in the form of anathematisms against the various points of the Nestorian
theory.” “These propositions were not well calculated to reclaim Nestorius; nor were they indeed so worded
throughout as to approve themselves to all who essentially agreed with Cyril as to the personal Deity of Christ.
On the contrary the abruptness of their tone, and a certain one-sidedness…made some of them open, prima
facie, to serious criticism from persons who, without being Nestorians, felt that in the attack on Nestorianism
the truth of Christ’s real and permanent manhood might be in danger of losing its due prominence.” Canon

is I think adopting every means to confirm them in a second synod. For supposing he who
lately wrote them at command, and anathematized all who did not wish to abide by them,
were presiding over an oecumenical council, what could he not effect? And be well assured,
my lord, that no one who knows the heresy they contain will brook to accept them, though
twice as many men of this sort decree them. Before now, though a larger number have rashly
confirmed them, I resisted at Ephesus, and refused to communicate with the writer of them
till he had agreed to the points laid down by me, and had harmonized his teaching with
them, without making any mention of the Chapters. This your holiness can ascertain without
any difficulty if you order the acts of the synod to be investigated; for they are preserved as
is customary with the synodical signatures, and there are extant more than fifty synodic acts
shewing the accusation of the Twelve Chapters. For before the journey to Ephesus the blessed
John1873 had written to the very godly bishops Eutherius of Tyana, Firmus of Cæsarea, and
Theodotus of Ancyra, denouncing these Chapters as Apollinarian.1874 And at Ephesus the
exposition and confirmation of these Chapters was the cause of our deposition of the Alexandrian
and of the Ephesian.1875 Moreover at Ephesus many synodic letters were written
both to the victorious emperor, and to the great officers, about these Chapters; and in like
manner to the laity at Constantinople and to the reverend clergy. Moreover when we were
summoned to Constantinople we had five discussions in the imperial presence, and afterwards
sent the emperor three protestations. And to the very godly bishops of the West, of
Milan I mean, of Aquileia, and of Ravenna, we wrote on the same subject, protesting that
the Chapters were full of the Apollinarian novelty. Furthermore their writer received a letter
from the blessed John by the hands of the blessed Paul,1876 openly blaming them; and in
like manner from Acacius of blessed memory. And to give your holiness concise information
on the subject I have sent you both the letter of the blessed Acacius, as well as that of the
blessed John to the blessed Cyril, in order that you may perceive that though they were
writing to him on the subject of agreement they blamed these Chapters. And the blessed
Cyril himself, in his letter to the blessed Acacius plainly indicated the drift of these Chapters

<head>CXIII. To Leo, Bishop of Rome.1877</head>
<p>If Paul, the herald of the truth, the trumpet of the Holy Ghost, hastened to the great
Peter1878 in order that he might carry from him the desired solution of difficulties to those
at Antioch who were in doubt about living in conformity with the law, much more do we,
men insignificant and small, hasten to your apostolic see1879 in order to receive from you
a cure for the wounds of the churches. For every reason it is fitting for you to hold the first
place, inasmuch as your see is adorned with many privileges. Other cities are indeed adorned
by their size, their beauty, and their population; and some which in these respects are lacking
are made bright by certain spiritual boons. But on your city the great Provider has bestowed
an abundance of good gifts. She is the largest, the most splendid, the most illustrious of the
world, and overflows with the multitude of her inhabitants. Besides all this, she has achieved
her present sovereignty, and has given her name to her subjects. She is moreover specially
adorned by her faith, in due testimony whereof the divine Apostle exclaims “your faith is
spoken of throughout the whole world.”1880 And if even after receiving the seeds of the
message of salvation her boughs were straightway heavy with these admirable fruits, what
words can fitly praise the piety now practised in her? In her keeping too are the tombs that
give light to the souls of the faithful, those of our common fathers and teachers of the truth,
<note type="footnote">1877 This celebrated letter may be dated towards the end of 449, allowing time for news to reach Theodoret
of his deposition at the Latrocinium on August 11. In 445 Leo had procured the well known decree from
Valentinian III, addressed to the famous Aetius in connexion with the dispute with Hilary of Arles, constituting
the bishop of Rome the chief authority in the Western Church, basing his demands not so much on the recognised
precedence of the imperial see as on the supposed primacy of St. Peter. But in 451, only two years after the date
of Theodoret’s letter the council of Chalcedon (Can. xxviii), after recording the canon (iii) of Constantinople
that “the bishop of Constantinople shall have the primacy of honour after the bishop of Rome, because that
Constantinople is new Rome,” added “we decree the same things concerning the privileges of Constantinople,
which is new Rome. The Fathers formerly gave the primacy to the see of old Rome, because she was the imperial
city, and gave like privileges to new Rome, rightly judging that the city which enjoyed like imperial privileges
should also be honoured in matters ecclesiastical, being next in rank.” We are yet very far from later claims.
Indeed even Gregory the Great when he protested against the title of oecumenical bishop, assumed by John the
Faster, did not claim it for himself.</note>
<note type="footnote">1878 Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem, not to Peter, but “unto the Apostles and elders.” Acts xv. 2.
Peter took a leading part in the discussion, but the “sentence” was pronounced not by Peter, but by James, and
the decree was that of “the Apostles and elders with the whole Church.” The slight “wresting” of the scriptures
of which Theodoret is guilty is due rather to a desire to compliment an important personage than in anticipation
of later controversies.</note>

Peter and Paul.1881 This thrice blessed and divine pair arose in the region of sunrise, and
spread their rays in all directions. Now from the region of sunset, where they willingly welcomed
the setting of this life, they illuminate the world. They have rendered your see most
glorious; this is the crown and completion1882 of your good things; but in these days their
God has adorned their throne1883 by setting on it your holiness, emitting, as you do, the
rays of orthodoxy. Of this I might give many proofs, but it is enough to mention the zeal
which your holiness lately shewed against the ill-famed Manichees, proving thereby your
piety’s earnest regard for divine things. Your recent writings, too, are enough to indicate
your apostolic character. For we have met with what your holiness has written concerning
the incarnation1884 of our God and Saviour, and we have marvelled at the exactness of your
expressions.</p>
<p>For both writings agreed in setting forth both the everlasting Godhead of the Only-begotten
derived from the everlasting Father, and the manhood derived from the seed of Abraham
and David; and that the nature assumed was in all things like unto us, being unlike
to us in this respect alone, that it remained free from all sin; since it springs not of nature
but of free will.</p>
<p>The letters moreover contain this, that the Only-begotten Son of God is one, and his
Godhead impassible, immutable, and invariable, like the Father who begat Him and the
Holy Spirit; and that on this account He took the passible nature, divine nature being incapable
of suffering, that by the suffering of His own flesh He might bestow freedom from
suffering on them that have believed in Him. These statements and others of like nature
were contained in your letters. We, in admiration of your spiritual wisdom, have lauded the
grace of the Holy Ghost uttered through you, and we invoke and beseech and beg and implore
your highness to protect the churches of God that are now assailed by the storm.</p>
<note type="footnote">1881 The traditional places of sepulture are, of half of each of the holy bodies, the shrine of SS. Peter and Paul

<p>We had expected that through the instrumentality of the representatives1885 sent by
your holiness to Ephesus, the tempest would have been done away, but we have fallen under
severer attacks of the storm. For the very righteous bishop of Alexandria was not content
with the illegal and very unrighteous deposition of the most holy and godly bishop of Constantinople,
the lord Flavianus, nor was his soul satisfied with a similar slaughter of the rest
of the bishops, but me too in my absence he stabbed with a pen, without summoning me
to the bar, without trying me in my presence, without questioning me as to my opinions
about the incarnation of our God and Saviour. Even murderers, tomb-breakers, and
adulterers, are not condemned by their judges until they have themselves confirmed by
confession the charges brought against them, or have been clearly convicted by the testimony
of others. Yet I, nurtured as I have been in the divine laws, have been condemned by him
at his pleasure, when all the while I was five and thirty days’ march away.</p>
<p>Nor is this all that he has done. Only last year when two fellows tainted with the unsoundness
of Apollinarius had gone thither and patched up slanders against me, he stood
up in church and anathematized me, and that after I had written to him and explained my
opinions to him.</p>
<p>I lament the disturbance of the church, and long for peace. Six and twenty years have I
ruled the church entrusted to me by the God of all, aided by your prayers. Never in the time
of the blessed Theodotus,1886 the chief bishop of the East; never in the time of his successors
in the see of Antioch, did I incur the slightest blame. By the help of God’s grace working
with me more than a thousand souls did I rescue from the plague of Marcion; many others
from the Arian and Eunomian factions did I bring over to our Master Christ. I have done
pastoral duty in eight hundred churches, for so many parishes does Cyrus contain; and in
them, through your prayers, not even one tare is left, and our flock is delivered from all
heresy and error. He who sees all things knows how many stones have been cast at me by
evil heretics, how many conflicts in most of the cities of the East I have waged against pagans,
against Jews, against every heresy. After all this trial and all this danger I have been condemned
without a trial.</p>
<p>But I await the sentence of your apostolic see. I beseech and implore your holiness to
succour me in my appeal to your fair and righteous tribunal. Bid me hasten to you, and
prove to you that my teaching follows the footprints of the apostles. I have in my possession

the writings of the apostles and the oracles of the prophets. From these it is not difficult to
ascertain whether I have adhered to the right rule of faith, or have swerved from its straight
course. Do not, I implore you, spurn my prayer; regard, I implore you, the insults piled after
all my labours on my poor grey head.</p>
<p>Above all, I implore you to tell me whether I ought to put up with this unrighteous deposition
or not; for I await your decision. If you bid me abide by the sentence of condemnation,
I abide; and henceforth I will trouble no man, and will wait for the righteous tribunal
of our God and Saviour. God is my witness, my lord, that I care not for honour and glory.
I care only for the scandal that has been caused, in that many of the simpler folk, and especially
those whom I have rescued from various heresies, cleaving to the authority of my
judges and quite unable to understand the exact truth of the doctrine, will perhaps suppose
me guilty of heresy.</p>
<p>All the people of the East know that during all the time of my episcopate I have not acquired
a house, not a piece of ground, not an obol, not a tomb, but of my own accord have
embraced poverty, after distributing, at the death of my parents, the whole of the property
which I inherited from them.</p>
<p>Above all I implore you, O holy sir, beloved of God, to grant me the help of your prayers.
I have told you this by the reverend and godly presbyters Hypatius and Abramius
chorepiscopi1887 and by Alypius exarch1888 of our monks. I would hasten to you myself
were I not kept back by the chains of the imperial order, which imprison me as they do
others. Treat my messengers, I beseech you, as a father might his sons; give them kindly
and unbiassed audience; deign to grant your protection to my old age,1889 slandered as it
is and attacked in vain. Above all, regard, to the utmost of your power, the faith conspired
against; preserve for the churches the inheritance of their fathers unimpaired. So will your
holiness receive the recompense due for such deeds from the great Giver of all good gifts.1890</p>

Ephesus. Nor is this known to us alone, but the fame of your orthodoxy has gone out into
all lands, and all men are celebrating your righteousness, your zeal, your boldness, and your
denunciation of my unfair treatment. And your holiness took this course after seeing one
massacre. If you had seen the others which took place after your departure you would perhaps

for the truth’s sake. For it is in the cause of the apostolic Faith, most holy, that we have undergone
that unrighteous massacre, because we refused to abandon the truth of the Gospel
doctrines. Now it behoves your holiness not to overlook the unjust persecution of men of
like mind with yourself, but by your just help to put a stop to injustice, and teach the assailants
of the truth that men who strive to act unscrupulously at their own good pleasure cannot

<p>A terrible storm has attacked our churches, but the adherents of the apostolic faith have
in your holiness a safe and quiet haven. Not only do you champion the cause of the doctrines
of the Gospel, but you utterly detest the wrong done to me. I was living far away at a distance
of thirty-five days’ journey, when I was condemned at their good pleasure by those most
righteous judges. Teaching which has obtained in the churches from the coming of God
our Saviour till this day they have abandoned. They have introduced a novel and bastard
doctrine, diametrically contrary to the tradition of the apostles, and are openly at war with
them that hold to the ancient instruction. Deign, then, most godly sir, to kindle the zeal of
the very sacred and holy archbishop, that the churches of the East too may enjoy your kindly
care. Above all fight in behalf of the faith delivered from the beginning by the holy apostles;
preserve the heritage of our fathers unimpaired, and scatter the mist that oppresses us. Give

unrighteously wrought against us. It is becoming to your holiness to add yet this act of zeal

<p>Your excellency has been fully informed as to the acts of the most righteous judges at
Ephesus, for their sound has gone out into all lands and their most just judgment to the
ends of the world.1904 What church has not felt the storm that has been raised by it? The
one side wronged, the other were wronged, but they who neither suffered nor did the wrong
share the distress of the wronged, and lament over them that so savagely and against all laws
human and divine massacred their own members. Even house breakers caught in the very
act are first tried and then punished by their judges; even murderers, violators of sepulchres,
and adulterers, are first haled before the bench, and their accusers ordered to make their
indictment, and the motive of the witnesses is tested to see that they are not giving evidence
to curry favour with the prosecutors, or are prejudiced against the defendants; and after this
they are bidden to make their defence to the charges brought against them. This is done
twice, thrice; sometimes even four times; and then, and not till then, after the truth has been
sought in the words of both accuser and accused, the sentence is given. As to how these men
judged in the case of the rest I will say nothing, lest I may seem a meddler in what does not
concern me. I am forced to speak on behalf of myself alone, for the unrighteous deed of violence
compels me. The imperial order kept me at home, and prevented me from travelling
beyond the bounds of the city placed under my pastoral care. The decision of the synod
went against me, and a man was condemned who was five and thirty days’ journey away.</p>
<p>Now the God of all said to the patriarch Abraham about Sodom and Gomorrah: “Because
the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great and because their sin is very grievous; I will
go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is
come unto me; and if not, I will know.”1905 He knew quite well the wickedness of those
men, and nevertheless He said, “I will go down and see,” so teaching us to wait for the proof
of facts. But these men never summoned me to trial, they never heard the sound of my voice,
they refused to hear from me a statement of my opinions, and handed me over, as a victim
to be slaughtered, to the rage of the enemies of the truth.</p>
<p>I, however, welcome my rest, and especially so at the present time, when the apostolic
decrees have been by many destroyed, and the new heresy strengthened. But lest any one
who does not know me should believe that the slanders uttered against me are true, and
should be scandalized at the idea of my holding opinions other than those of the gospel, I

<p>Even the enemies of the truth must, I think, be indignant at the injustice and illegality
of the violence done us. It is only reasonable that the nurslings of the truth, at whose head
stands your excellency, should be still more distressed at this new and surprising tragedy.
It is only right that those who are the more grieved should show the more earnestness and

the Church’s body now in peril of being torn asunder. Wherefore I beseech your excellency

<head>CXXI. To Anatolius the Patrician.1908</head>
<p>The Lord who overlooks and governs all things has shewn both the apostolic truth of
my doctrines, and the falsehood of the slander laid at my door. For the writings sent from
the right godly and holy lord Leo, archbishop of Great Rome, to Flavianus of holy memory
and to the rest assembled at Ephesus, are entirely in harmony with what I myself have
written and have always preached in church. So soon therefore as I had read them, I praised
the loving-kindness of the Lord, in that He had not wholly forsaken the churches, but had
protected the spark of orthodoxy; or—shall I not rather say?—not a spark, but a very great
torch, such as might enkindle and enlighten the world; for he has truly, in his writings, ob-
served the apostolic stamp, and in them we have found at once what has been delivered by
the holy and blessed prophets and apostles, and their successors in the preaching of the
Gospel, and moreover the holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa. By these I confess that I abide,
and indict all who hold other doctrines as guilty of impiety. Side by side with these writings
of mine I have set one of the letters sent by him to Ephesus, to the end that when your excellency
reads them you may remember the words which I have often spoken in church, may
recognise the harmony of the doctrines, and may hate the utterers of the lie as well as those
who have set up their new heresy in opposition to the doctrines of the Apostle.</p>

<p>I have been greatly delighted that we who correspond in character should have corresponded
by letter. But I do not quite see what you mean by saying “Are not these my words?”
If it were said only for the sake of salutation, I am not annoyed at it; but if it is intended to
remind me of the advice which recommended silence, and of the so-called oeconomy,1911
I am very much obliged, but I do not accept the suggestion. For the divine Apostle charges
us to take quite the opposite course. “Be instant in season and out of season.”1912 And the
Lord says to this very spokesman, “Be not afraid, but speak”1913 and to Isaiah, “Cry aloud,
spare not”1914 and to Moses “Go down, charge the people”1915 and to Ezekiel “I have made
thee a watchman unto the house of Israel,” and it shall be “if thou warn not the wicked,”1916
and the like: for I think it needless to write at length to one who knows. Not only therefore
are we not distressed at having spoken freely, but we even rejoice and are glad, and laud
Him who has thought us worthy of these sufferings; aye and call on my friends to encounter
the same perils.</p>
<p>If they know that we do not keep the apostolic rule of the faith, but swerve to the right
hand or the left, let them hate us; let them join the opposite side; let them be ranked with
them that are at war with us. But if they bear witness to our holding the right teaching of
the gospel message, we hail them with the cry, “Do you too ‘stand having your loins girt
about with truth,<gap reason="omitted"/>and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,’”1917 and
so on, for it is said that virtue comprises not only temperance, righteousness, and prudence,
but also courage, and that by means of courage the rest of its component parts are preserved.
For righteousness needs the alliance of courage in its war against wrong; temperance vanquishes
intemperance by the aid of courage. And for this reason the God of all said to the

<p>Your letter was a long one, and a pleasant one, and it shews how warm and genuine is
your affection. So delighted am I with it that I am not at all sorry for having erroneously
conjectured the meaning of the beginning of your former one. For my misapprehension of
the intention of your letter has disclosed your brotherly love, made plain the sincerity of
your faith, and shewn your zeal for the true religion. We have indeed shared between us the
words and the trials of the prophet; your holiness has used the words; I am buffeted by the
hurricane and billows, and against the rowers of the ship I exclaim in his words “They that
observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.”1922 Perhaps He who is Jonah’s Lord and
mine will grant that I too may rise and be released from the monster. But if the surge continue
to boil I trust that even thus I shall enjoy the divine protection, and learn by my own
experience how His strength is “made perfect in weakness,”1923 for He has measured the
peril by my infirmity. The divine prophet whom I have mentioned was flung into the sea
by his shipmates one and all, but I am granted the consolation of your holiness, and of
other godly men. For them and for your godliness I pray that the blessing bestowed upon
the excellent Onesiphorus may be yours, for you have not blushed at my gibes; nay rather
you have shared in my afflictions for the faith’s sake.</p>
<p>And one thing which I wish you to know is that, though other godly bishops have sent
me their bounty, I have declined to receive it;—not from any want of respect to the senders,
God forbid;—but because hitherto food convenient for me has been provided by Him Who
gives it even to the ravens without stint. In the case of your reverence I have acted differently,
for really the warmth of your affection has overcome what has hitherto been my fixed
principle. For be well assured, my godly friend, that ever since friendship grew up between

<head>CXXV. To Aphthonius, Theodoritus, Nonnus, Scylacius, Apthonius, Joannes, Magistrates of
the Zeugmatensis.</head>
<p>I know the strength and stability of your faith, and have been filled with the greatest
possible delight, for, since we worshippers of the eternal Trinity constitute one body, it is
only natural that together with the members that are sound the rest of the members should
rejoice. So says the divine Apostle; “Whether one member be honoured all the members
rejoice with it.”1925 I therefore rejoice with you in your struggles on behalf of the apostolic
doctrines and your following of the famous Naboth in more excellent things. Naboth for
his vineyard’s sake suffered most unrighteous slaughter, because he would not give up the
heritage of his fathers. You are fighting not for vineyards, but for divine doctrines, and reject
this new-fangled and spurious heresy as blackening the brightness of the teaching of the
gospel; you do not suffer the number of the blessed Trinity to be diminished or increased.
For it is diminished by those who ascribe the passion of the only begotten to the Godhead;
it is increased by those who have the audacity to introduce a second son. You believe in one
only begotten, as you do in one Father and in one Holy Ghost. In the only begotten made
flesh you behold the assumed nature which He took from us and offered on our behalf. The
denial of this nature puts our salvation far from us; for if the Godhead of the only begotten
is impassible, as the nature of the Trinity is impassible, and we refuse to acknowledge that
which is by nature adapted to suffer, then the preaching of a passion which never happened
is idle and vain. For if that which suffers has no existence how could there be a passion? We
declare that the divine nature is impassible;—a doctrine confessed by our opponents as well
as by ourselves. How then could there be a passion when there is no subject capable of suffering?
The great mystery of the oeconomy will appear an appearance, a mere seeming instead
of the reality. This is the fable started by Valentinus, Bardesanes, Marcion and Manes. But
the teaching handed down to the churches from the beginning recognises, even after the
incarnation, one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and confesses the same to be everlasting God,
and man made at the end of days; made man not by the mutation of the Godhead but by
the assumption of the manhood. For suppose the divine nature to have undergone mutation
into the human nature, then it did not remain what it was; and if it is not what it was, they
who have these objects of worship are false in calling Him God. We, on the contrary, recognise
the only begotten Son of God to be immutable as God, and Son of the very God. For
we have learnt from the divine Scripture that being in the form of God He took the form of
the servant;1926 and took on Him the seed of Abraham, not was changed into Abraham’s
seed; and shared just as we do both in flesh and blood and in a soul immortal and immaculate.

Preserving these for our sinful bodies He offered His sinless body and for our souls His soul
free from all stain. It is for this reason that we have the hope of the common resurrection
for the race will assuredly share with its first fruits, and as we have shared with Adam in his
death, so too with Christ our Saviour shall we be sharers in His life. This the divine Apostle
has plainly taught us, for “now” he says “is Christ risen from the dead and become the first
fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead, for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”1927</p>

the Lord of all to keep you safe in the faith and make stronger than him who sifts us.1928</p>

<p>I praised your holiness on your quitting the envied see. Once it was venerable; now it
is ridiculous, for we have made it a thing to be bought and sold. I was astounded to hear of
your having appealed to the men who ejected you. You ought to have done just the contrary,
and, on being invited to grasp the tiller, to have declined to do so, on the ground that your
shipmates had become your foes. Are you not aware, most godly sir, what our Saviour,
through His sacred apostles, taught us to preach? Do you not know what the heirs of the
apostolic doctrines have just now laid down as objects of worship? For who of the old
teachers from the time when the message was first preached down to the period of the
darkness that now obtains, ever listened to any one preaching one nature of flesh and
Godhead or dared at any time to call the nature of the only begotten passible? These doctrines
in our day are by some men openly and boldly uttered, while among others their utterance
is overlooked, and by silence men become participators in the blasphemy. What then, may
well be asked, is the proper course to be taken by those who abominate such doctrines? They
have, I should reply, two alternatives before them; they may either come to close quarters,
and prove the spuriousness of the doctrines, or they may decline communion with their
opponents as openly impious.</p>
<p>I, indeed, have received the wrong done me as a divine blessing. I do not mean that I
have thanked them that have wronged me; how could I thank fratricides, and men who have
become followers of Cain?</p>
<p>But I praise my Master for thinking me worthy of the lot of them that suffer wrong, for
separating me from wrong-doers and blasphemers, and for giving me my most delightful
rest.</p>

<p>Not without purpose does the supreme Ruler allow the spirits that are against us to
agitate the waves of impiety. He does so that He may try the courage of the sailors, and,
while He exhibits some men’s manliness, convicts others of cowardice, stripping the mask
from the faces of some who put on an appearance of piety, and proclaiming others as foremost
fighters in the ranks of the truth. We have seen an instance of this in the present time. The
storm rose high; some shewed their secret impiety; some abandoned the truth which they
were holding, went over to the phalanx of our foes, and now, with them, are smiting the
very men whom they used to call their chiefs. The witnesses of these things detest the enemy
and pity the deserters, but are afraid to give aid to the victims of the attack upon the
apostolic doctrines. Nay, suppose the traitors to urge them with greater insistency, they will
perhaps themselves pass over to the side of the assailants, will give no quarter to their fellowbelievers,
but will drive against them their barbs side by side with the very men whom they
accuse. They will act thus though they have been taught by the divine Scripture that a wrong
done to one’s neighbour incurs punishment, while the suffering of injustice entails great
and lasting rewards.</p>
<p>Your own piety, your zeal for the faith, and your good will to myself, have been proved
by this agitation. Twice you have written me a letter in contempt of all that might deter you,
and have thus shewn your brotherly affection. You have also indicated the conflict you are
sustaining on behalf of the apostolic doctrines. You ask me to tell you by letter what we
ought to think and preach concerning the passion of salvation. I have received your request
with delight, and, not indeed to give you information but only to remind one who is beloved
of God, will proceed to tell you what I have learnt from the divine Scripture and from the
Fathers who have interpreted it.</p>
<p>Know then, most godly sir, that before all things it is necessary to observe the distinction
of terms, and, in addition to this, the cause of the divine incarnation. Once let these be made
clear, and there will be no ambiguity left about the passion. We will therefore first, to those
who endeavour to contradict us, put this enquiry. Which of the names given to the only
begotten Son of God are anterior to the incarnation, and which posterior, or rather, connected
with the operation of the oeconomy? They will reply that the terms anterior are, “God the
Word,” “only begotten Son,” “Almighty,” and “Lord of all creation”; and that the names
“Jesus Christ” belong to the incarnation. For, after the incarnation, God the Word, the only
begotten Son of God is called Jesus Christ; for “Behold” He says “unto you is born this day
Christ the Lord”1940 and because others had been called christs, priests, kings, and prophets,
<note type="footnote">1939 Timotheus was Bishop of Doliche, a town of the Euphratensis. He was present at Antioch when Athanasius
of Perrha was deposed, and also at Chalcedon. The letter may be dated from Nicerte in 450.</note>

<pb n="704"/>
lest any one should suppose Him to be like unto them, the angels conjoined the title Lord
with that of Christ, in order to prove the supreme dignity of Him that was born. And, again,
Gabriel says to the blessed Virgin, “Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
a son and shalt call His name Jesus”1941 “for He shall save His people from their sins.”1942
Before the incarnation, however, He was never called either Christ or Jesus. For truly the
divine Prophets, in their predictions of things to come, used the words, just as they prophesied
about the birth, the cross, and the passion, when the events had not yet come to pass. Nevertheless,
even after the incarnation He is called God the Word, Lord, Almighty, only begotten
Son, Maker, and Creator. For He was not made man by mutation, but, remaining just what
He was, assumed what we are, for “Being in the form of God,” to use the words of the divine
Apostle “He took the form of a servant.”1943 On this account, therefore, even after the incarnation,
He is called also by the titles which are anterior to the incarnation, since His
nature is invariable and immutable. But when relating the passion the divine Scripture
nowhere uses the term God, since that is the name of the absolute nature. No one on hearing
the words “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God”1944 and similar expressions, would suppose that the flesh existed before the ages, or
is of one substance with the God of the universe, or was Creator of the world. Every one
knows that these terms are proper to the Godhead. Nor would any one on reading the
genealogy of St. Matthew suppose that David and Abraham according to nature were forefathers
of God, for it is the assumed nature which is derived from them.</p>
<p>Since then these points are plain and indubitable even among extreme heretics, and we
acknowledge both the nature which is before the ages, and that which is of recent time, so
are we bound to recognise at once the passibility of the flesh, and the impassibility of the
Godhead, not dividing the union nor separating the only begotten into two persons, but
contemplating the properties of the natures in the one Son. In the case of soul and body,
which are of natures contemporary and naturally united, we are accustomed to make this
distinction, describing the soul as simple, reasonable, and immortal, but the body as complex,
passible, and mortal. We do not divide the union, nor cut one man in two. Far rather, then,
in the case of the Godhead, begotten of the Father before the ages, and of the manhood assumed
of David’s seed, is it becoming to adopt a similar course, and distinctly to recognise
the everlasting, eternal, simple, uncircumscribed, immortal, and invariable character of the
one nature, and the recent, complex, circumscribed, and fluctuating nature of the other.
We acknowledge the flesh to be now immortal and incorruptible, although before the resur-

rection it was susceptible of death and of passion; for how otherwise was it nailed to the
tree, and committed to the tomb? And though we recognise the distinction of the natures,
we are bound to worship one Son, and to acknowledge the same as Son of God and Son of
man, form of God, and form of a servant, Son of David, and Lord of David, seed of Abraham,
and creator of Abraham. The union causes the names to be common, but the community
of names does not confound the natures. With them that are right-minded some names are
plainly appropriate as to God, and others as to man; and in this way both the passible and
the impassible are properly used of the Lord Christ, for in His humanity He suffered, while
as God He remained impassible. If, according to the argument of the impious, it was in the
Godhead that He suffered, then, I apprehend, the assumption of the flesh, was supererogatory;
for suppose the divine nature to have been capable of undergoing passion, then He did not
need the passible manhood. But grant that, as even their own argument contends, the
Godhead was impassible, and the passion was real, let them beware of denying that which
suffered, lest they deny with it the reality of the passion; for if that which suffers does not
exist, then the passion is unreal. Now for any one who likes to open the quaternion1945 of
the sacred evangelists, it is easy to perceive that the divine Scripture distinctly proclaims the
passion of the body, and to learn from them how Joseph of Arimathæa came to Pilate, and
begged the body of Jesus; how Pilate ordered the body of Jesus to be delivered, how Joseph
took down the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped the body of Jesus in the linen cloth,
and laid it in the new tomb. All this is described by the four evangelists with frequent mention
of the body. But if our opponents adduce the words of the angel to Mary and her companions,
“Come where the Lord lay,”1946 let them be referred to the passage in the Acts which states
that devout men “carried Stephen to his burial”1947 and observe that it was not the soul, but
the body, of the victorious Stephen, to which the customary rites were paid. And to this very
day, when we approach the shrines of the victorious martyrs, we commonly enquire what
is the name of him who is buried in the grave, and those who are acquainted with the facts
reply peradventure “Julian the martyr,” or “Romanus,” or, “Timotheus.”1948</p>
<note type="footnote">1945 The word τετρακτύς commonly expresses the sum of the first four numbers in the Pythagorean system,
i.e. 10, the root of creation; (1+2+3+4=10.) Cf. the Pythagorean oath “Ναὶ μὰ τὸν ἁμετέρᾳ ψύχᾳ παραδόντα
τετρακτύν.” Its use for τετραδεῖον or τετράδιον (cf. Acts xii. 4) may indicate acceptance of the theory of the
mystic and necessary number of the gospels of which early and remarkable expression is found in Irenæus (cont.
Hær. iii. 11.)</note>
<note type="footnote">1946 Matt. xxviii. 6</note>
<note type="footnote">1947 Acts viii. 2</note>
<note type="footnote">1948 There were many martyrs of the name of Julianus. Theodoret might have visited a shrine of Julianus
martyred at Emesa in the reign of Numerian. A Romanus was one of the seven martyrs at Samosata in the persecution
of Diocletian. Among martyred Timothei was one who suffered at Gaza in 304.</note>

<pb n="706"/>
<p>Very often it is not entire bodies that are buried, but only very small remains, yet nevertheless
we speak of the body by the name that belongs to the whole man. It was in this sense
that the angel called the body of the Lord, “Lord,” because it was the body of the Lord of
the universe. Moreover the Lord Himself promised to give on behalf of the life of the world,
not His invisible nature, but His body. “For,” He says, “the bread that I will give is my flesh
which I will give for the life of the world,”1949 and when He took the symbol of divine
mysteries, He said, “This is my body which is given for you.”1950 Or according to the version
of the Apostle, “broken.”1951 In no place where He spoke of the passion did He mention
the impassible Godhead.</p>
<p>It is therefore before all things necessary that the question should be put to those who
are endeavouring to contradict us whether they confess that the perfect manhood was assumed
by God the Word, and assert the union to have been made without confusion. Once
let these points be admitted, and the rest will follow in due course, and the passion will be
attributed to the passible nature. I have now summed up these heads and have exceeded the
limits of my letter. I have sent also what I lately wrote at the suggestion of a very godly and
holy man of God, the lord—1952in the form of a concise instruction designed to teach the
truth of the apostolic doctrines. Should I find a good copyist, I will also send your holiness
what I have written in the form of a dialogue,1953 extending the argument, and strengthening
my positions, by the teaching of the Fathers. I have moreover now sent a few statements of
the ancient teachers, sufficient to shew the drift of their instruction. Give me in return, most
godly sir, the succour of your prayers, that I may pass through the terrible tempest and reach
the quiet haven of the Saviour.</p>

<p>You have shewn alike your zeal for the true religion, and your love for your neighbour,
both of which are at the present time clearly connected, for it is for the sake of the apostolic
decrees that I am being attacked, because I refuse to give up the heritage of my fathers, and
prefer to undergo any suffering to looking lightly on the robbery of one tittle from the faith
of the Gospel. You have accepted fellowship in my sufferings, not only by comforting me
by means of your letter, but further by sending to me the very honourable and pious Matthew
and Isaac. You shall hear, I am well assured, from the lips of the righteous Lord, “I was in
prison, and ye visited me.”1955 We are small and of no account, and burdened by a great
load of sins, but the Lord is bountiful and generous. He remembers the small rather than
the great, and says, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these”1956 “which
believe in me”1957 “ye have done it unto me.”1958 I pray you in that you are conspicuous
for right doctrine, and shine by worthiness of life, and therefore have great boldness before
God, help me in your prayers, that I may be able “to stand,” to use the words of the
Apostle,1959 “against the wiles of error,” escape the sins of the destroyer, and stand, though
with little boldness, in the day of the appearing before the righteous Judge.</p>

<head>CXXXII. To Ibas, Bishop of Edessa.1960</head>
<p>The Lord has taught them that suffer wrong not to be cast down, but to rejoice, and to
derive consolation from the examples of old. For from the period of the first men down to
our own days we find instances of men who have been zealous in the worship of the God
of all, and yet have been wronged by those with whom their lot was cast, and have fallen
into many and grievous troubles. Of these I would have gone through the entire list, had I
not been writing to one of accurate knowledge of the divine Scriptures. But since you, O
beloved of God, have been nurtured from your boyhood in the divine oracles, I have thought
it needless so to do. I only ask you to cast your eyes on them, and to look on all the kindhearted
clergy that have done wrong, with sorrow; on all that look lightly on wrong doing,
with pity; and to be sorrowful for the disquiet of the Church. I ask you to rejoice and be glad
that I am a sharer in suffering for the sake of true religion, and to praise without ceasing
Him who has imposed this lot on me. As for honour and comfort and the dignity of sees
and wretched reputation, let us yield them to the murderers.1961</p>
<p>Let us cleave only to the doctrines of the gospel, and with them, if need be, endure any
extremity of pain, and choose honourable penury rather than wealth with its many cares.</p>
<p>I am not writing in these terms in order to give you exhortation, for I know the courage
of your holiness in trouble. My object is to make my own mind known to your piety, and
to inform you that you have on your side comrades who are gladly incurring peril for the
truth’s sake. I have been anxious for some time to write thus to you, but I have been unable
to find anyone to convey my letter. Now I have met with the very honourable and pious
presbyter Ozeas, a man who is at once engaged in the battle for truth and attached to your

<p>I have always known, sir, that you are not unmindful of our friendship. And it has ever
been my wish and prayer that your piety should give heed to exact truth, and shun the
communion of traitors to true religion, ascribing to the Supreme Ruler His care on our behalf.
For indeed, while I have been silent and inactive, He has put an end to our very keen and
terrible sufferings, and has replaced the dire tempest by this bright calm. And now that the
loving-kindness of the Lord has granted us this blessing, I find the quiet of my retreat indeed
delightful, for I feel the necessity of persuading those who have been led away by the slanders
launched against me, and of both convincing them of the truth of the teaching of the gospels,
and refuting the attack of falsehood. When once this refutation is finished, and the victory
of the truth is secured, it is my purpose to quit public life, and withdraw to the rest that I so
greatly long for. As to the foes of the truth I cry with the prophet, “Their memorial is perished
with a noise, but the Lord shall endure for ever.”1963 As to ourselves, I sing with the
Psalmist, “He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters, He delivered
me from my strong enemy.”1964</p>
<p>This letter is in reply to two received from your holiness, one conveyed by Anastasius,

<head>CXXXIV. To Theoctistus, Bishop of Beroea.1965</head>
<p>Our Saviour, Lawgiver, and Lord, was once asked, “What is the first commandment?”
His reply was “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind.” And He added “This is the first commandment: and the second is
like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” Then He said further “On these two
commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”1966</p>
<p>He then who keeps these, according to the definition of the Lord, plainly fulfils the Law;
and he who transgresses them is guilty of transgressing the whole Law. Let us then examine,
before the exact and righteous tribunal of our conscience, whether we have fulfilled the divine
commandments. Now the first is kept by him who guards the faith given by God in its integrity,
who abominates its assailants as enemies of the truth and hates heartily all those
who hate the beloved; and the second by him who most highly esteems the care of his
neighbour and who, not only in prosperity but also in apparent misfortunes, observes the
laws of friendship. They, on the other hand, who look after their own safety, as they suppose,
who on its account make little of the laws of friendship and take no heed of their friends
when assaulted and attacked, are reckoned to belong to the number of the wicked and of
them that are without. The Lord of all requires better things at the hands of His disciples.
“Love” He says “your enemies, for if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? for
the sinners and the publicans do this.”1967 I, however, have not received even such kindness
as publicans receive. Publicans, do I say? I have not even received the consolation given to
murderers and wizards in their dungeons. If every one had imitated this cruelty, nothing
else would have been left then for me in my life time but to be wasted by want, and, at my
death, instead of being committed to a tomb, to be made meat1968 for dogs and wild beasts.
But I have found support in those who care nought for this present life, but await the enjoyment
of everlasting blessings, and these furnish me with manifold consolation. But the loving

<head>CXXXV. To Bishop Romulus.1972</head>
<p>You have reminded me of the ancient story, and remarked how the King of the Syrians,
bethinking him of the loving kindness of the kings of Israel, assumed the form of a suppliant
and failed not to obtain his petition. Remember therefore, sir, the divine wrath. God delivered
Ahab to utter destruction for using mercy, and delivered his sentence through the mouth
of the prophet, saying “Thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people.”1973 We
are thus commanded to temper mercy with justice, since not every kind of mercy is pleasing
to the God of all. The present state of affairs specially requires prudent council; for we are
contending on behalf of the divine doctrines, wherein we have the hope of our salvation.
But herein, too, may be seen the great difference between man and man. Some men are
verily infected with the common impiety; while others, without distinction, advance at one
time one doctrine, and at another its opposite. Some who know the truth conceal it in the
secret chambers of their soul, while they preach impiety with the rest; others again who are
filled with envy have made their private ill-will an occasion of waging war against the truth,
and wreak all kinds of mischief against the prophets of the truth. Again, there are who embrace
the truth of the apostolic doctrines, and yet because they are afraid of the power of
the dominant party are too cowed to proclaim it, and though they lament at the abundance
of our misfortunes, nevertheless side with them that set the mighty surge a-rolling. It is in
this last category that we place your reverence. We have believed you to be sound in the divine
doctrines, and think that you keep your affection for me, and are borne along with the time
for no other reason than your cowardice. Under these circumstances though I am not
writing to any of the rest, I write to your holiness, and receive your reply. I see your drift
and to some extent I pardon your pusillanimity. But the loving Lord has now removed all
occasions of cowardice, by exhibiting the new-fangled impiety, and shewing the plain truth
of the gospels. I, even though my mouths were as many as my hairs, cannot praise as I ought
the loving-kindness of the Lord for compelling my strongest opponents openly to preach
what has been preached by me. For I have heard that he who shares your holiness’s roof,
when he heard that anathemas had been published in the great cities, ceased to imitate the
crooked gait of crabs, and, after disputing in a certain assembly about doctrines, walked in
the straight road. Never must we suit our words to the season, but ever preserve the unbending
rule of truth.</p>

that edicts anathematizing Eutyches were published soon after the accession of Marcian.</note>

<p>I was very much distressed to hear of the trouble which had befallen you. How indeed
could I fail to suffer, making as I do your interest mine, and remembering the apostolic law
which bids us not only “rejoice with them that do rejoice, but also weep with them that
weep”?1975 Suffering itself is able to draw even those that are at enmity with one another
into sympathy.</p>
<p>What is so grievous as to lose a wife; one who bore blamelessly the yoke of wedlock,
one who made her husband’s life pleasant, one who shared the care of the family; one who
managed the household and shared in the direction of everything; one who was ready to
suggest whatever might be likely to be of service, and to comply with the wishes of her
husband? But what sorrow could surpass the committal to the tomb of the mother at the
same moment as the son whom she bore; a son who had been carefully trained and had received
a learned education; one who, you hoped, would be the stay of your old age; buried
in the very spring of his manhood, when the down was just beginning to grow upon his
cheeks? Did we only look at the character of the calamity, it admits of no consolation. But
when we bethink us how our race is doomed to die; that against that race the divine fiat has
gone forth; that suffering is common, for life is full of such woes; we shall bravely bear what
has happened, shall repel the assaults of despair, and shall raise that wonderful song of praise
“The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; the Lord hath done what seemed to him
good; blessed be the name of the Lord.”1976 But we have many more reasons for consolation.
We have been distinctly taught the hopes of the resurrection, and we look for the time when
the dead shall live again. We know how the Lord many times called death sleep. If we trust,
as in truth we do, the Saviour’s words, we are bound not to mourn those that have fallen
asleep, even though their sleep lasts somewhat longer than it is wont. We must await the
resurrection. We must remember that the Ruler of the world in His wisdom, and clearly
knowing as He does not the present only but the future also, guides events for our good. A
wise man who knew all this full well reasons about deaths of this kind and says, “Yea; speedily
was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding.”1977</p>
<p>Let us submit I beg you to the wise Ruler of all; let us submit to His decrees. Whether
they be pleasant or whether they be grievous, they are good and profitable, they make men
wise; for them that endure they ordain crowns.</p>

<p>The blessed David fell into several errors, which God, who wisely orders all things, has
caused to be recorded for the good of them that were to come after. But it was not on their
account that Absalom, parricide, murderer, impious, and altogether vile, started his wild
war against his father. The reason of his beginning that most unrighteous struggle was because
he coveted the sovereignty. The divine David, however, when these events were coming to
pass, began to remember the wrong that he had done. I too am conscious within myself of
the guilt of many errors, but I have kept undefiled the dogmatic teaching of the Apostles.
And they who have trampled upon all laws human and divine, and condemned me in my
absence, have not sentenced me for what I have done wrong, for my secret deeds are not
made manifest to them; but they have contrived false witness and calumny against me, or
rather in their open attack upon the doctrines of the Apostles have proscribed me for my
obedience to them. “So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep; He smote His enemies in the
hinderparts and put them to a perpetual shame.”1979 Counterfeit and spurious doctrines
He has scattered to the winds, and has provided for the free preaching of those which He
has handed down to us in the holy Gospels. To me this suffices for complete delight. I do
not even long for a city in which I have passed all my time in hard work; all I long for is to
see the establishment of the truth of the Gospels. And now the Lord has satisfied this longing.
I am therefore very glad and happy, and I sing praises to our generous Lord, and I invite
your reverence to rejoice with me, and, with our praises, to put up the earnest prayer that
the men who say now one thing and now another and change about to suit the hour, like
the chameleons who assume the colour of the leaves, may be strengthened by the lovingkindness
of the Lord, established upon the rocks and, of His mercy, made to pay the highest
honour to the truth.</p>

<head>CXXXVIII. To Anatolius the Patrician.1980</head>
<p>I have cordially welcomed the rest which has fallen to my lot, and am harvesting its beneficial
and pleasant results. Our Christ-loving Emperor,1981 after reaping the empire as
fruit of his true piety, has offered as first-fruits of his sovereignty to Him that bestowed it,
the calm of the storm-tossed churches, the triumph of the invaded faith, the victory of the
doctrines of the Gospel. To these he has added the righting of the wrong done to me. Of a
wrong so great and of such a kind who ever heard? What murderer was ever doomed in his
absence? What violator of wedlock was ever condemned without a hearing? What burglar,
grave-breaker, wizard, church-robber, or doer of any other unlawful deed, was ever prevented,
when eager to appeal to the law, and slain when far away by the sentence of his judge? In
their cases nothing of the kind was ever known. For, by our law, plaintiff and defendant are
bidden to stand face to face before the judge, while the judge has to wait for the production
of plain truth, and then and not till then, either dismiss the accused as innocent, or punish
him as being reached by the indictment. In my case the course pursued has been just the
opposite. The emperor’s letter forbade me to approach the far-famed synod, and the most
righteous judges condemned me in my absence, not after fair trial, but after extravagant
laudation of the documents which were produced to incriminate me. Neither the law of
God nor shame of man staved the deed of blood. Orders were given by the president,1982
flinging the truth to the winds, and courting the power of the hour. He was obeyed by men
who think as I do, whose doctrines are my doctrines, and who had expressed admiration of
me and mine. None the less did that day convict some men of treachery; some of cowardice;
while to me a ground of confidence was given by my sufferings for the truth’s sake. And to
me our master Christ hath granted the boon “not only of believing on Him but also of suffering
for His sake.”1983 For the greatest of all gifts of grace are sufferings for the Master’s
sake, and the divine Apostle puts them even before great marvels.</p>
<note type="footnote">1980 This is the last of the series of Theodoret’s letters to his illustrious friend. It expresses his gratitude for
his restitution by Marcian and begs Anatolius to use his best endeavours to get a council called to settle the difficulties
of the Church. The letter thus dates itself in the year 451 and indicates that the calling of the council of
Chalcedon was to some extent due to Theodoret’s initiative. At the earlier sessions at Chalcedon Marcian was
represented by Anatolius, and it was partly the authority of Anatolius which overbore the protests of Dioscorus

ancient peace for the churches, and I am sure that they do, beg their pious graces to take
part in the proceedings, that their presence may overawe those of a contrary mind and the
truth may have none to gainsay her, but may herself by her own unaided powers examine
into the position of affairs, and the character of the apostolic doctrines.</p>
<p>I make this request to your excellency, not because I long to see Cyrus again, for your
lordship knows what a solitary town it is, and how I have somehow or other managed to
conceal its ugliness by my great expenditure on all kinds of buildings, but to the end that
what I preach may be shewn to be in agreement with apostolic doctrines while the inventions
of my opponents are counterfeit and base. Once let this come to pass, by God’s help be it
spoken, and I shall pass the remainder of my days in cheerful contentment, wherever the
Master may bid me dwell. To you who have been brought up in the true religion, and are
dowered with the wealth of goodness it is becoming to make this effort, and by your urgent
counsel to render yet more zealous our most pious emperor and the Christ-loving Augusta,
zealous already as they are to strengthen their glorious empire by laudable and rightful energy.</p>

<p>To the other good deeds of your excellency must be added your having acquainted our
pious and most christian emperor, whom God’s grace has appointed for the blessing of his
subjects, of the enormous wrong done against me, and your having by a righteous edict
annulled an edict which was nothing of the kind. Supported by divine Providence I have
made what they reckoned a punishment a means of good, and I have welcomed my rest
with delight; but none the less I have been wrongly and illegally treated, though in no single
point guilty of the errors which the enemies of the truth slanderously laid at my door, but
yet made to suffer the penalty of the greatest criminals. Nay, my fate has been yet harder
than theirs. I was judged without a trial; I was doomed in my absence; when forbidden by
the emperor’s orders to go to Ephesus I received the most righteous sentence of my holy
judges. All this has now been undone by his most serene majesty, through the active interposition
of your excellency. I, for my part, feeling that I should be wrong to keep silent and
not offer you my thanks, have availed myself of this letter, whereby I beseech your excellency
to speak in warm terms in my behalf both to the victorious and Christian emperor and to
the very godly and pious Augusta. On their behalf I implore our good Lord as earnestly as
lies in my power to guard their empire in security, and to grant that it may be at once a
source of loving protection for their subjects, and of terror to their foes, and establish honourable
peace for all. May your excellency be induced to petition them completely to put
an end to the agitation of the Church, and order the assembling of the council; not, like the
last, of men who from their habits of unruliness throw the synod into confusion, but, in
peace and quiet, of members instructed in divine things, and in the habit of confirming the
apostolic decrees and rejecting what is spurious and at variance with the truth. And I express
this hope to the end that your excellency may reap the good which such a course of conduct
is likely to produce.</p>

<head>CXL. To the Master Vincomalus.1986</head>
<p>I have been much astonished to learn that your magnificence, though quite unacquainted
with me and mine, and knowing only the wrong that had been done me, stood up as my
advocate, and left no means untried to undo the results of the conspiracy against me. But
your excellency will assuredly receive recompense from our bountiful Lord, for He who
promised to give a reward for a little water will doubtless give greater recompense to the
givers of greater gifts.</p>
<p>I have indeed endured such sufferings as none, or at least very few, of the ancients have
undergone, and this not only from my open foes, but, as I apprehend, from my real friends.
The former attacked me, the latter betrayed me.</p>
<p>Who in the world ever heard of such a trial? Who ever commanded a criminal to be
tried in his absence after chaining him up at a distance of more than five and thirty stages?
What judge has ever been so savage and inhuman as not only to try men, aye but to condemn
men the sound of whose voice he has never heard, and this in most savage and inhuman
fashion? The Lord has ordered the erring brother, who spurns advice, after a first, second
and third admonition, to be treated as “an heathen man and a publican.”1987 Now these
most equitable and righteous judges have not even given to them of the same faith with
themselves the treatment which they give to heathen men and publicans. These indeed they
do see and occasionally converse with, and that with all honour and deference where they
appear to be of rank and dignity. But they have ordered me to be cut off from home, from
water, from everything. This is the way in which they have wished to become imitators of
our Father in heaven “Who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust.”1988 But of these men I will say no more. The tribunal
of the Lord is at hand where is required not stage pretence but the reality of life. Now I beseech
your excellency to express my thanks to the emperor, the lover of Christ and victorious,
and to the very pious and godly Augusta, for having made true religion the firm root of their
pious empire, and to implore their majesties to make the peace of the churches firm by
commanding the assembling of a council, not of men of violence who throw the discussion
into confusion, but of the lovers of the truth who confirm the apostolic teaching, and repudiate
this new fangled and spurious heresy. And I pray that of these honourable endeavours
you may reap the fruit at the hands of our loving Lord.</p>
<note type="footnote">1986 The internal evidence of the letter makes it synchronize with the preceding. The advocacy of the cause
of Theodoretus by Vincomalus is the more striking in that it does not appear to have been suggested by personal

<p>Bright is made your holiness by your goodly life, exhibiting on earth the image of the
conversation of the angels, but it is made still brighter by your zeal for the apostolic faith.
As keel to boat, as corner-stone to house, so to them that choose to live in piety is the truth
of the doctrines of the Gospel. For this truth when assailed you have bravely fought, not
striving to protect it as though it were weak, but shewing your godly disposition; for the
teaching of our Master Christ is gifted with stability and strength, in accordance with the
promise of the same Saviour, “that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”1990 It is the
loving and bountiful Lord who has thought right that I too should be dishonoured and slain
on behalf of this doctrine. For truly we have reckoned dishonour honour, and death life.
We have heard the words of the apostle “For unto us it is given by God not only to believe
on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”1991 But the Lord arose like the sleeper, and stopped
the mouths of them that uttered blasphemy against God and injustice against me. But He
has made the tongues of the pious pour forth their fountains in their wonted message. I,
however, am gathering the delightful fruits of rest; as I look at the agitation of the churches
I am grieved, but I rejoice and am glad at being freed from cares. I have ever been gratified
at your admirable piety, but heretofore I have not written, not from any lack of regard for
the dictates of charity, but because I have waited for some suitable occasion. Just now, having
fallen in with the most pious and prudent monks who have been sent by your holiness on
other business, I have lost no time in carrying out my wish. I salute your godliness. I beg
you in the first place to support me with your prayers, and further to cheer me by a letter,
for by God’s grace I have been attacked for the Gospel’s sake.</p>
<note type="footnote">1989 The Acoemetæ, “sleepless,” or “unresting,” were an order of monks established in the 5th century by
Alexander, an officer of the imperial household. Marcellus, the third Abbot, was a second founder, and was
warmly supported by the patriarch Gennadius of Constantinople. (458–71.) Before Chalcedon he joined with
other orthodox abbots to petition Marcian against Eutyches. (Labbe iv. 531 Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 813). Alexander’s
foundation was of 300 monks of various nations, divided into six choirs, and so arranged that the work of praise
and prayer should “never rest.” This has been copied elsewhere and since, “where tapers day and night On the
dim altar burned continually, In token that the house was evermore Watching to God. Wordsworth, Exc. viii.</note>

<head>CXLII. To the Same.</head>
<p>I have already addressed your reverence in another letter, and have delivered it to your
much respected brethren. Now again I address your holiness. I am induced to do so both
by your admirable life, and by the praiseworthy zeal which you have shewn on behalf of the
apostolic faith, fearless alike of imperial power and of episcopal combination. For granted
that the majority of the council consented under coercion, still they did confirm the new
fangled heresy by their signatures. Your holiness, however, was shaken by none of these
things, but abided by the ancient doctrines which the Lord, by means of both the prophets
and the apostles, has taught the churches to hold. These decrees I pray that I may preserve,
and keep to the end my faith and confession in one Father, one Son and one Holy Ghost.
For the incarnation of the only begotten made no addition to the number of the Trinity.
Even after the incarnation the Trinity is still a Trinity. This is the teaching I have received
from the beginning; this has been my faith; in this was I baptized; this have I preached; in
this have I baptized, this I continue to hold. Of them that utter a lie about the Father the
Lord has said “When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own,”1992 for what is said of the
teacher is appropriate to the disciples. So these men who employ lies against me speak of
their own, and do not describe what is mine. I am comforted by my Master’s words “Blessed
are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against
you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven.”1993</p>
<p>I entreat your piety to pray that I may not have my part among the wrong doers, but
among them that suffer wrong on account of the truth of the Gospels.</p>

<p>I have never seen your piety nor have we ever communicated by letter, but I have become
warmly attached to you. What has wrought the charm and continues to inflame it is the
report unanimously brought by the tasters of your honey. All express admiration of the orthodoxy
of your faith, the brightness of your life, the constancy of your soul, the harmoniousness
of your character, the attractiveness and sweetness of your society and all the other
characteristics of the true foster child of philosophy. For all these reasons I am attached to
your godliness, and my longing has made me even begin a correspondence; but, my dear
sir, grant me as soon as possible what I desire and let me have written communication from
you. For when friends are at a distance considerable comfort is given them by epistolary
communication. You will write to no man of heterodox opinions, but to one nurtured in
the teaching of the apostles and preacher not of a quaternity but of a Trinity, for in reality
I see little difference in the impiety of those who have the hardihood to endeavour to contract
into one the two natures of the Only-begotten and those who endeavour to divide our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, God the Word made man, into two sons; if such indeed
there be; I cannot think so; but Arians, Eunomians, and Apollinarians too have ever
shamelessly fabricated this slander against the Church, and indeed laborious students may
easily perceive that our far famed Fathers,1995 lights of the churches, laboured at the hands
of the foes of the truth under this accusation which is now levelled against me by the most
excellent champions of the new fangled heresy. Our wise Lord has laid bare their impiety,
for He could not endure to confirm the unholy heresy by His long suffering.</p>
<p>Be sure then, sir, that you will be writing to one of like sentiments with your own; and
of this you can easily assure yourself from my copious writings.</p>
<p>Write then to me in return, and again your letter, by God’s leave, shall serve to kindle
affection. And before you write, give me the help of your prayers, and beseech our good
Lord to guide my feet into the right road, that I may travel the rest of my journey in accordance
with His laws. You who have won right of access from your unstained life will easily
persuade Him Who is eager to give us His good gifts.</p>

<head>CXLIV. To the Soldiers.1996</head>
<p>Human nature is everywhere the same, but pursuits in life are many and various. Some
men prefer a sailor’s career, some a soldier’s; some men become athletes, some husbandmen;
some ply one craft and some another. To pass by all other differences, some men are zealous
and diligent about divine things, and get themselves instructed in the exact teaching of the
apostolic doctrines; while others, on the contrary, become slaves of the belly, and suppose
that the enjoyment of base pleasures is happiness. Others again are there, lying in a mean
between these two extremes, who do not exhibit this praiseworthy enthusiasm, nor embrace
a life of incontinence, but still honour the simplicity of the faith. Men who attack the statement
that some things are altogether impossible with God must not, I apprehend, be classed
with the zealous and the well instructed in divine things, but rather either with those who
have no exact knowledge of the apostolic doctrines, or those who have been enslaved by
pleasures and shift hither and thither at the caprice of a moment, setting forth now one
thing and now another.</p>
<p>You have asked me to write on these points. I should prefer at the present time to keep
silence. But in obedience to the commandment of the Lord, “Give to every man that asketh
of thee,”1997 I am constrained briefly to reply.</p>
<p>I say then that the God of the universe can do all things, but that in the word “all” is
comprehended only what is right and good, for He who is naturally both wise and good
admits of nothing that is of a contrary nature, but only what becomes his nature. If any ob-
jectors gainsay this statement, ask them if the God of the universe, the lawgiver of truth, can
lie. If they say that lying is possible to God, expel them from your company as impious and
blasphemous. Should they agree that lying is not possible to the God of the universe, ask
them in the second place, if He who is the fount of justice can become unjust. Should they
allow that this too is impossible to the God of all, you must yet again enquire if the unfathomable
depth of wisdom can become unwise, God cease to be God, the Lord cease to be the
Lord, the Creator be no Creator, the Good not good but evil and the true Light not light but
its opposite. If they admit that all these things and the like are impossible to God, you must
say to them therefore many things are impossible with God; and that their being impossible
so far from being a proof of want of power, indicates on the contrary the greatest power.</p>
<p>Even in the case of our own soul, when we say that it cannot die, we do not predicate
weakness of it, but we proclaim its capacity of immortality. And similarly when we confess
the immutability, impassibility, and immortality of God, we cannot attribute to the divine
<note type="footnote">1996 From the mention at the end of the letter of the epistle of Leo to Flavianus, Garnerius argues that it must
be dated at the end of 449 or somewhat later. The epistle of Leo is dated on the 13th of June and could not have
reached Theodoret in his detention at Cyrus till the autumn.</note>

nature change, passion, or death. Suppose them to urge that God can do whatever He will,
you must reply to them that He wishes to do nothing which it is not His nature to do; He
is by nature good, therefore He does not wish anything evil; He is by nature just, therefore
He does not wish anything unjust; He is by nature true, therefore He abominates falsehood;
He is by nature immutable, therefore He does not admit of change; and if He does not admit
of change He is always in the same state and condition. This He Himself asserts through
the prophet. “I am the Lord I change not.”1998 And the blessed David says “Thou art the
same and Thy years shall have no end.”1999 If He is the same He undergoes no change. If
He is naturally superior to change and mutation He has not become from immortal, mortal
nor from impassible, passible, for had this been possible He would not have taken on Him
our nature. But since He has an immortal nature, He took a body capable of suffering, and
with the body a human soul. Both of these He kept unstained from the defilements of sin,
and gave His soul for the sake of the souls that had sinned, and His body for the sake of the
bodies that had died. And since the body that was assumed is described as body of the very
only begotten Son of God, He refers the passion of the body to Himself. But the four evangelists
testify that it was not the divine nature but the body which was nailed to the cross,
all teaching with one voice that Joseph of Arimathea came to Pilate and begged the body of
Jesus; that he took down the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped in fine linen, and laid
in his own new tomb the body of Jesus; that Mary the Magdalene came to the tomb seeking
the body of Jesus and ran to His disciples, and reported these things when she could not
find the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>This is the unanimous teaching of the evangelists. But if your opponents urge that the
angels said “Come see the place where the Lord lay”2000 let the foolish folk learn that the
divine Scripture says also about the victorious Stephen “And devout men carried Stephen
to his burial.”2001 And yet it was the body only which was deemed proper for burial, while
the soul was not buried together with the body; nevertheless the body alone was spoken of
by the common name. Similarly the blessed Jacob said to his sons “Bury me with my fathers.”
2002 He did not say “Bury my body.” Then he went on “There they buried Abraham
and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.”2003
He did not say “their bodies.” The names are common to bodies or souls, but nevertheless
it is only the bodies which he called by the common names. In this manner too we constantly

describe the shrines of the holy apostles, prophets and martyrs, one it may be of Dionysius,
another of Julianus another of Cosmas.2004 And yet we know that only fragmentary remains
of bodies lie there, while the souls in diviner regions are at rest. Precisely the same custom
is to be found in common use, for such an one, we say, died; and such an one lies in this
place; although we know that the soul is immortal and does not share the tomb with the
body. In this sense the angel said “Come see the place where the Lord lay”2005 not because
he shut the Godhead in the tomb, but because he spoke of the Lord’s body by the Lord’s
name.</p>
<p>In proof of this being the view of the holy Fathers let them mark the words of Athanasius,
illustrious archbishop of Alexandria, who adorned his episcopate with confession. He
exclaims “Life cannot die, but rather quickens the dead.”</p>
<p>Let them hear too the words of the far-famed Damasus bishop of Rome, “If anyone allege
that on the cross pain was undergone by the Godhead and not by the body with the soul,
the form of the servant which He had taken in its completeness, let him be anathema.”2006</p>
<p>Let them hear too the very sacred and holy bishop of the Church of the Romans, the
lord Leo, who has now written “The Son of God suffered as He was capable of suffering,
not according to the nature which assumed but that which was assumed. For the impassible
nature assumed the passible body, and gave it for us, to the end that He might work out our
salvation and at the same time preserve His own nature impassible.”</p>
<p>And again “For He did not come to destroy His own nature but to save ours.”2007</p>
<p>If therefore they accuse us for saying that God can do what He wishes, but that He
wishes what is becoming to His own nature, and what is unbecoming He neither wishes
nor is capable of; let them accuse too these saints and all the rest who maintain this position.
Let them accuse even the Apostle who says “That by two immutable things in which it was
impossible for God to lie.”2008 And again “If we believe not, yet He abideth faithful: He
cannot deny Himself.”2009</p>
<p>Repeat these passages to your opponents, and if they are convinced, praise the good
Lord for that, by means of your zeal, He has benefited them. If they remain unconvinced,
enter into no discussion with them about doctrines, for it is forbidden by the divine apostle

<head>CXLV. To the Monks of Constantinople.2012</head>
<p>There is nothing new or surprising in the fact that the men who have made their tongues
weapons against our God and Saviour should also aim their shafts of falsehood against His
right minded servants. It must needs be that the servants who grieve sorely at the outrage
inflicted on their Master should share it. That so it should be they have been forwarned by
their Lord Himself, Who consoles His holy disciples with the words “If they have persecuted
me they will also persecute you.”2013 “If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub,
how much more shall they call them of His household.”2014 Then He cheered them by
pointing out that calumny is easily detected, for He went on “There is nothing covered that
shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known.”2015 I have often seen the truth of the
divine prediction, but I see it with special clearness now. The authors of the calumny against
me, who have bought my destruction for large sums of money, have been distinctly seen to
be involved in the unsoundness of Valentinus and Bardesanes. They had hoped to cloke
their own iniquity if only they could whet their tongues on the hone of falsehood in order
to wound me. For ever since I saw that the heresy long ago extinguished had been renewed
by these men I never ceased to cry aloud, bearing my testimony in private and in public, as
well in social gatherings as in the temples of God, and strive to confute their conspiracy
against the faith. They have consequently poured out their insults on my head, and allege
that I preach two sons. But they ought to have convicted me to my face, not slandered me
behind my back. They have done just the contrary. They tied me hand and foot at Cyrus by
the imperial decree; they compelled the very righteous judges to condemn me without a
trial, and delivered their most equitable sentence against a man who was five and thirty
stages away. Such treatment was never suffered by any criminal charged with witchcraft or
robbery of the dead, by murderer or by adulterer. But for the present I will leave the judges
alone, for the Lord is at hand “Who judges the world with righteousness and the people
with his truth;”2016 Who exacts an account not only of words and deeds, but even of evil
thoughts. But think it right to refute the false charge which has been made. What proof have

Theodoret mentions his condemnation at the Latrocinium and the exile of Eutyches, but says nothing of the
favourable action towards himself of Marcianus. Theodosius died on the 29th of July, and Marcian began his
reign on the 25th of August, 450. Theodoret could not possibly hear of the exile of Eutyches before the end of
September. The document may therefore be dated in the late autumn of 450 before Theodoret had received the

they of my asserting two sons? Had I been one of the silent kind there might have been some
ground for the suspicion, but my task has been to contend on behalf of the apostolic decrees,
to bring the pasture of instruction to the Lord’s flocks, and to this end I have written five
and thirty books interpreting the divine Scripture, and proving the falsehood of the heresies.
The falsehoods these men have concocted are therefore easy of refutation. Tens on tens of
thousands of hearers testify that I have taught the truth of the doctrines of the Gospel, and
for any one who likes to bring them to the test my writings lie before the world. Not on behalf
of a duality of sons, but of the only begotten Son of God, against the heathen, against Jews,
against the recipients of the plague of Arius and Eunomius, against the supporters of the
madness of Apollinarius, against the victims of the corruption of Marcion, I have never
ceased to struggle; trying to convince the heathen that the Eternal Son of the ever living God
is Himself Creator of the Universe; the Jews that about Him the prophets uttered their predictions,
the Arians and Eunomians that He is of one substance, of one dignity and of equal
power with the Father; Marcion’s mad adherents that He is not only good but just; and Saviour

We provide that those who year by year come up for holy baptism should carefully learn
the faith set forth at Nicæa by the holy and blessed Fathers; and initiating them as we have
been bidden,2017 we baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, pronouncing each name singly. Furthermore when performing divine service in the
churches, both at the beginning and the decline of day and when dividing the day itself into
three parts, we glorify the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost.2018 If, as our slanderers allege,
we preach two sons, which do we glorify and which do we leave unworshipped? It were the
wildest folly to believe that there are two sons, and to give the doxology to one alone. And
who is so distraught as, while hearing the words of the divine Paul “one Lord, one faith, one
baptism,”2019 and again “there is one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things,”2020 to lay
down the law at variance with the teaching of the Spirit, and cut the one in two. But I am

two sons because I confess the two natures of our Master Christ. And they refuse to perceive
that every human being has both an immortal soul and a mortal body; yet no one has hitherto
been found to call Paul two Pauls because he has both soul and body, any more than Peter
two Peters or Abraham or Adam. Everyone recognises the distinction of the natures, and
does not call one man two Pauls. Precisely in the same way, when styling our Lord Jesus
Christ the only begotten Son of God, God the Word incarnate, both Son of God and Son of
Man, as we have been taught by the divine Scripture, we do not assert two sons, but we do
confess the peculiar properties of the Godhead and of the manhood. The party however
who deny the nature assumed of us men cannot hear these arguments without irritation.</p>
<p>It is only right that I should point out from what sources they have derived this impiety.
Simon, Menander, Cerdo, and Marcion absolutely deny the incarnation, and call the birth
from a Virgin fable. Valentinus, however, Basilides, Bardesanes, and Harmonius and their
following, accept the conception of the Virgin and the birth; but they deny that God the
Word took anything from the Virgin, but made as it were a transit through her as through
a conduit, and appeared to mankind in semblance only, and seeming to be a man, in like
manner as He was seen by Abraham and certain others of the ancients. Arius and Eunomius
on the contrary held that He assumed a body, but that the Godhead played the part of the
soul, in order that they may attribute to it what was lowly in His words and deeds. Apollinarius
did indeed assert that He assumed a soul with the body, not the reasonable soul, but
the soul which is called animal or phytic.2021 Their contention is that the Godhead took the
part of the mind. He had learnt the distinction of soul and of mind from the philosophers
that are without while divine Scripture says that man consists of soul and body. For we read
“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life and man became a living soul.”2022 And the Lord in the sacred Gospels
said to His apostles “Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul.”2023</p>
<p>So great is the divergence between the doctrines. These men have now done their best
to outdo Apollinarius, Arius and Eunomius, in their impiety and have now endeavoured
to plant anew the heresy sown of old by Valentinus and Bardesanes, and afterwards uprooted
by most excellent husbandmen. Like Valentinus and Bardesanes they have denied that the
body of our Lord was assumed of our nature. But the Church, following the footprints of
the Apostles, contemplates in the Lord Christ both perfect Godhead and perfect manhood.
For just as He took a body, not that He needed a body, but by its means to give immortality
to all bodies; so too He took a soul, the guide of the body, that every soul by its means might
share His immutability. For even if souls are immortal, they are not however immutable;

for they undergo many and frequent changes, as they experience pleasure, now from one
object, and now from another. Whence it cometh about that we err when we are changed
and are inclined to what is worse. But after the resurrection our bodies enjoy immortality
and incorruptibility, and our souls impassibility and immutability. For this reason the only
begotten Son of God took both a body and a soul, preserved them free from all blame, and
offered the sacrifice for the race. And this is why He is called our high priest; and He is
named high priest not as God but as man. He makes the offering as man, and accepts the
sacrifice with the Father and the Holy Spirit as God. If only Adam’s body had sinned, it
alone should have benefited by the cure. But since the soul not only shared in the sin but
was first in the sin, for first the thought forms an image of the sin and then carries it out by
means of the body, it was just, I ween, that the soul too should be healed. But it is perhaps
superfluous to demonstrate these points by reasoning, when the divine Scripture clearly
proclaims them. This doctrine is distinctly taught by the holy David and the very divine
Peter, the one foretelling from distant ages, and the other interpreting his prediction. The
words of the first of the apostles are “David therefore being a prophet, and knowing that
God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He
would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of
Christ that His soul was not left in hell neither His flesh did see corruption.”2024</p>
<p>Now he has given us much instruction on the same point in these few words. First he
states that the assumed nature derives its descent from the loins of David; secondly that He
took not a body only, but also an immortal soul, and thirdly that He delivered body and
soul to death, and, after taking them again, raised them as He would. His own words are
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”2025 But we have learnt that the divine
nature is immortal. What suffered was the passible, and the impassible remained impassible.
For God the Word was made man not to render the impassible nature passible, but on the
passible nature, by means of the Passion, to bestow the boon of impassibility. And the Lord
Himself in the holy Gospels at one time says “I have power to lay down my life and I have
power to take it again, no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself;” “That I may
take it again.”2026 And again “Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life
for the sheep,”2027 and again “Now is my soul troubled”2028 “my soul is exceeding sorrowful
even unto death”2029 and of His body He says “The bread that I will give is my flesh which

I will give for the life of the world,”2030 and when He delivered the divine mysteries and
broke the symbol and distributed it, He added “This is my body which is being broken for
you for the remission of sins,”2031 and again “This is my blood which is shed for many for
the remission of sins,”2032 and again “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
His blood ye have no life in you”2033 and “Whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood hath eternal life” “in himself” he adds.2034 Innumerable passages of the same character
may be quoted, both in the old Testament and the new, pointing out the assumption both
of the body and of the soul, and that they are descended from Abraham and David. Joseph
of Arimathea when he came to Pilate begged the body of Jesus, and the fourfold authority2035
of the holy Gospels tells us how he received the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and
committed it to the tomb. I do, indeed, sorrow and lament that I am compelled by the attacks
of error to adduce against men supposed to be of one and the same faith with myself the
arguments which I have already urged against the victims of the plague of Marcion,—of
whom, by God’s grace, I have converted more than ten thousand, and brought them to Holy
Baptism. What child of the church ever had any doubts on these points? Who has not cited
this teaching of the holy Fathers? The works of the great Basil are full of it; as well, as those
of his fellow soldiers Gregory and Amphilochius, and of those who in the West have been
illustrious teachers of grace, Damasus, bishop of great Rome, and Ambrose of Milan; and
Cyprian of Carthage who for the sake of these doctrines won the martyr’s crown. Five times
was the famous Athanasius driven from his flock and compelled to dwell in exile; and in
the cause of these doctrines strove too his master Alexander. Eustathius, Meletius, and
Flavianus, luminaries of the East, and Ephraim, harp of the Spirit, who daily waters the
people of Syria with the streams of grace; John and Atticus, loud heralds of the truth; and
men of an earlier age than they, Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenæus, Justin, and Hippolytus, of
whom the more part not only shine at the head of the company of bishops, but also adorn
the martyr’s band.</p>
<p>He, too, who now rules great Rome and diffuses in all directions from the West the rays
of right teaching, the most holy Leo, has expressed to me this distinctive mark of the faith
in his own letters. All these have clearly taught that the only begotten Son of God and ever-

lasting God, ineffably begotten of the Father, is one Son; and that after the incarnation He
was called both Son of man and man, not because He was changed into manhood, for His
nature is immutable, but because He took what was ours. They teach too that He was both
impassible and immortal as God, and mortal and passible as man; but after the resurrection
even in relation to His humanity He received impassibility and immortality, for, though the
body remained a body, still it is impassible and immortal, verily a divine body and glorified
with divine glory. This is distinctly told us by the blessed Paul in the words “For our conversation
is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, who
shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto the body of His glory.”2036 He
does not say to “His glory” but to “the body of His glory,” and the Lord Himself, when He
had said to His apostles “There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they
see the Son of man coming in His Father’s glory,”2037 took them after six days into an exceeding
high mountain, and was transfigured before them, and His face became as the sun,
and His raiment was bright like the light.2038 By these means He shewed the manner of the
second advent. He taught that the assumed nature is not uncircumscribed (for this is characteristic
of the Godhead alone) but that it shall send forth flashes of the divine glory, and
emit rays of light transcending the powers of the sense of sight. With this glory He was taken
up; with this the angels said that He should come; for their words were “He who was taken
from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”2039
When moreover He was seen by the divine apostles after the resurrection, He shewed them
both hands and feet; and to Thomas He shewed also His side and the wounds of the nails
and of the spear. For on account of those men who positively deny the assumption of the
flesh, and further of those others who assert that after the resurrection the nature of the
body was changed into the nature of Godhead, He preserved unaltered the prints of the
nails and of the spear. And while raising all other bodies free from every disfigurement,2040
in His own body He left the marks of His sufferings, to the end that deniers of the assumption
of the body may be convicted of their error by means of His sufferings; and holders of the
notion that His body was changed into another nature may be taught by the print of the
nails that it abides in its own proper qualities. Suppose any one to imagine that he has a
proof that the body of the Lord did not remain a body after the resurrection in the fact that
He came in to the disciples when the doors were shut, let such an one remember how He
walked upon the sea while His body was still mortal, how He was born after keeping the

seals of virginity intact, and how again when encircled by them that were plotting against
Him He frequently escaped from their hands. But why need I mention the Lord, who was
not only man, but God before the ages, and to whom it was easy to do whatsoever He would?
Let them tell how Habakkuk was translated from Judæa into Babylon in a moment of time
and passed through the covering of the den, and brought the food to Daniel, and returned
again. without destroying the seals of the den.2041 It is sheer foolishness to enquire into the
manner of the miracles of the Lord, but in addition to what has been said it ought also to
be known that after the resurrection our bodies also will be incorruptible and immortal,
and being released from what is earthly will become light and æthereal. This moreover is
distinctly taught us by the divine Paul in the words “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption, it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in dishonour it is raised
in glory; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body”2042 and in another place “We
shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.”2043 If then the bodies of the
saints become light and æthereal and easily travel through the air, we cannot wonder that
the Lord’s body united to the Godhead of the only begotten, when, after the resurrection,
it had become immortal, entered in when the doors were shut.</p>
<p>Countless other proofs might be quoted without difficulty from apostles and prophets.
But what has been already said is enough to show the drift of my teaching. I believe in one
Father, one Son and one Holy Ghost; and I confess one Godhead, one Lordship, one substance
and three hypostases. For the incarnation of the only begotten did not add to the
number of the Trinity, and make the Trinity a quaternity, but, even after the incarnation
the Trinity was still a Trinity. And while confessing that the only begotten Son of God was
made man I do not deny the nature which He took, but confess, as I have said, both the
nature which took and the nature which was taken. The union did not confound the properties
of the natures. For if the air by receiving the light through all its parts does not cease
to be air, nor yet at the same time destroy the nature of the light, for with our eyes we behold
the light and by our feeling we recognise the air, as it meets us cold or hot, or moist or dry,
so it were sheer folly to call the union of the Godhead and the manhood confusion. If created
natures which share at once subordinate and temporal existence, when united and in some
sense mingled, yet remain unimpaired, and, when the light withdraws, the nature of the air
is left alone, much more proper is it, I apprehend, for the nature which fashioned all things,
when conjoined with and united to the nature which it assumed from us, to be acknowledged
to continue itself in its purity, and in like manner to preserve unimpaired that which it had
assumed. Gold, too, when brought in contact with the fire, participates both in the colour

and power of fire, but it does not lose its own nature, but at the same time remains gold and
has the active qualities of fire. In this manner also the Lord’s body is a body, but impassible,
incorruptible, immortal, of the Lord, divine and glorified with the divine glory. It is not
separated from the Godhead, nor yet is of any one else, save of the only begotten Son of God
Himself. For it does not show to us another person, but the only-begotten Himself clad in
our nature.</p>
<p>This is the doctrine which I am continually preaching. They on the other hand who
deny the incarnation wrought on our behalf have called me a heretic, adopting a course
something like that of unchaste females, who, while they sell their own charms, assail honest
women with the insults of their profession, and apply language proper to their own wantonness
to women who hold such wantonness in abhorrence. This is how Egypt has acted. She
has herself fallen willingly into the thraldom of base desire. She has lavished her servile adulation
on a man of chaste character. Then, failing to entice him by her wiles, or to trap him
in the snares of her voluptuous passion, she describes one who is faithful to purity as an
adulterer.</p>
<p>But these men will be called to account by God, as well for their devices against the faith
as for the snares they have laid against me. I only charge those who have been influenced
by the false accusations uttered against me to keep one ear for the accused, and not to give
both to the accusers. In this manner they will fulfil the divine law which lays down “Thou
shalt not raise a false report,”2044 and “Judge righteously between every man and his
brother.”2045 In these words the divine law charges us not to believe the calumnies uttered
against the absent but to judge the accused face to face.</p>

<head>CXLVI. To John the OEconomus.2046</head>
<p>Rest and a life free from care are very grateful to me. I have therefore blocked the door
of the monastery, and decline intercourse with my friends.</p>
<p>But I have received information that fresh attacks are being made against the Faith of
the Gospels, and therefore conclude that there may be danger in my silence. When wrong
has been done some mortal prince, not only the guilty authors of the outrage but they also
who have been standing by and made no effort to drive off the assailants, are in peril of
punishment: What penalty then ought not to be undergone by men who can venture to look
lightly on the utterance of blasphemy against our God and Saviour? This is the fear which
has impelled me now to write and expose the innovations of which I have been informed.</p>
<p>It is said that a common report in the city represents that after certain presbyters had
offered prayer, and concluded it in the wonted manner, while some said “For to Thee belongs
glory and to thy Christ and to the Holy Ghost;” and others “Through grace and loving
kindness of thy Christ, with whom belongs glory to Thee with thy holy Spirit,” the very wise
archdeacon prohibited the use of the expression, “the Christ” and said that the “only begotten”
ought to be glorified. If this is true it were impossible to exceed the impiety. For he
either divides the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons and regards the only begotten Son as
lawful and natural, but the Christ as adopted and spurious, and consequently unmeet for
being honoured in doxology; or else he is endeavouring to support the heresy which has
now burst in on us with the riot of wild revelry. Had a grievous tempest been now oppressing
us, any one might have supposed that the blasphemer suited his blasphemy to the necessity
of the moment, through fear of the power of the originators of the heresy. But now that He
who is blasphemed has rebuked the winds and the sea, and blessed the storm-tossed churches
with a calm, while everywhere by land and sea the proclamation of the apostles is preached,
what room is there for the blasphemy? While not even they who have lately basely inserted
among the doctrines of the Church that flesh and godhead are of one and the same nature
have ever forbidden the offering of praise to the Lord Christ. This fact may be easily ascertained
from those who have returned thence. A man holding the foremost place in the ecclesiastical
rank ought to have known the divine Scripture, and to have learnt from it that
just as the heralds of the truth rank the only begotten Son with the Father, so accordingly
using the title of “the Christ” instead of that of “Son” they number Him sometimes with the
Father and sometimes with the Holy Ghost; for the Christ is none other than the only begotten
Son of God. So we may quote the divine Paul writing to the Corinthians, but teaching
the world, that “There is one God the Father of whom are all things<gap reason="omitted"/>and one Lord Jesus
<note type="footnote">2046 Cf. note on page 288. This letter, or rather doctrinal statement is incomplete. Garnerius supposes it to

<pb n="735"/>
Christ by whom are all things.”2047 Thus he calls the same person, Christ, Jesus, Lord, and
Creator of all things. And writing to the Thessalonians he says “Now God Himself and our
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.”2048 And in his second epistle
to the same he puts the Christ before the Father, not to invert the order, but to teach that
the order of the names does not indicate a distinction of dignity and nature. His words are
“Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and
hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts,
and stablish you in every good word and work.”2049 And at the end of his Epistle to the
Romans after certain exhortations he adds “I beseech you brethren for the Lord Jesus Christ’s
sake and for the love of the spirit.”2050 Now if he had known the Christ as being any other
than the Son he would not have put Him before the Holy Ghost. Writing to the Corinthians,
at the very beginning of his letter, he mentions the name of Christ as alone sufficient to influence
the faithful. “Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that
ye all speak the same thing”2051 and when writing to them a second time he thus concludes
“The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father and the communion of
the Holy Ghost be with you all.”2052 Here he puts the name of Christ not only before the
Spirit, but also before the Father and this in all the churches is the beginning of the Liturgy
of the Mystery.</p>
<p>According, then, to this extraordinary regulation the august name of our God and Saviour,
Jesus Christ, ought to be omitted from the mystic writings. But it is unnecessary to
say more on this point. The opening of every one of his letters is distinguished by the divine
Apostle with this address. At one time it is “Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an
apostle.”2053 At another “Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ.”2054 At another “Paul
a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ.”2055 And suiting his benediction to his exordium
he deduces it from the same source and links the title of the Son with God the
Father, saying “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”2056

And he graces the conclusion of his letters with the blessing “The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all, amen.”2057</p>
<p>Copious additional evidence may be found whereby it may be learnt without difficulty
that our Lord Jesus Christ is no other person than the Son which completes the Trinity. For
the same before the ages was only begotten Son and God the Word, and after the resurrection
He was called Jesus and Christ, receiving the names from the facts. Jesus means Saviour;
“Thou shalt call His name Jesus for He shall save His people from their sins.”2058</p>
<p>He is named Christ from being as man anointed with the Holy Ghost, and called our
High Priest, Apostle, Prophet and King. Long ago the divine Moses exclaimed “The Lord
thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto
me.”2059 And the divine David cries “The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, Thou art a
priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.”2060 This prophecy is confirmed by the divine
Apostle.2061 And again “seeing then that we have a great High Priest that has passed into
the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.”2062</p>
<p>That as God, He is king before the ages that prophetic minstrelsy teaches us in the words
“Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a right sceptre.”2063</p>
<p>His majesty as man is also shown us. For having the sovereignty of all things as God
and Creator, He assumes this majesty as man, wherefore it is added “Thou lovest righteousness
and hatest wickedness, therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows.”2064 And in the second psalm the anointed one himself says “Yet was I
set as king by Him upon the holy hill of Sion, I will declare the decree of the Lord. The Lord
hath said unto me ‘Thou art my Son this day have I begotten Thee; ask of me and I shall
give Thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
possession.’”2065 This He said as man, for as man He receives what as God He possesses.
And at the very beginning of the psalm the gift of prophecy ranks Him with God the Father
in the words “Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing. The kings of
the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against
His anointed.”2066</p>

the great Peter, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”2067 Let us hear the Lord
Christ confirming this confession, for “On this rock,” He says, “I will build my church and
the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.”2068 Wherefore too the wise Paul, most excellent
master builder of the churches, fixed no other foundation than this. “I,” he says, “as a wise
master builder have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man
take heed how he buildeth thereon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.”2069 How then can they think of any other foundation, when they are
bidden not to fix a foundation, but to build on that which is laid? The divine writer recognises
Christ as the foundation, and glories in this title, as when he says, “I am crucified with Christ:
nevertheless I live; yet not I but Christ liveth in me.”2070 And again “To me to live is Christ
and to die is gain,”2071 and again “For I determined not to know anything among you save
Jesus Christ and Him crucified.”2072 And a little before he says, “But we preach Christ crucified
to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness, but unto them which are
called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.”2073 And in
his Epistle to the Galatians he writes, “But when it pleased God who separated me from my
mother’s womb and called me by His grace to reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him
among the heathen.”2074 But when writing to the Corinthians he does not say we preach
“the Son” but “Christ crucified,” herein doing no violence to his commission, but recognising
the same to be Jesus, Christ, Lord, only begotten, and God the Word. For the same reason
too at the beginning of his letter to the Romans he calls himself “servant of Jesus Christ”
and describes himself as “separated unto the gospel of God, which He had promised afore
by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which

was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of God
with power”2075 and so on. He calls the same both Jesus Christ, and Son of David, and Son
of God, as God and Lord of all, and yet in the middle of his epistle, after making mention
of the Jews, he adds, “whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
came, who is over all God blessed for ever, amen.”2076 Here he says that He who according
to the flesh derived His descent from the Jews is eternal God and is praised by the right
minded as Lord of all created things. The same teaching is given us in the Apostle’s words
to the excellent Titus “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”2077 Here he calls the same both Saviour, and great God,
and Jesus Christ. And in another place he writes, “In the kingdom of Christ and of God.”2078
Moreover the chorus of the angels announced to the shepherds “Unto you is born this day
in the city of David<gap reason="omitted"/>Christ the Lord.”2079</p>
<p>But to men who meditate on God’s law day and night, it is indeed needless to write all
the proofs of this kind; the above are sufficient to persuade even the most obstinate opponents
not to divide the divine titles. One point, however, I cannot endure to omit. He is alleged
to have said that there are many Christs but one Son. Into this error I suppose he fell through
ignorance. For if he had read the divine Scripture, he would have known that the title of the
Son has also been bestowed by our bountiful Lord on many. The lawgiver Moses, the writer
of the ancient history, says “And the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
fair and they took them wives of them,”2080 and the God of all Himself said to this Prophet
“Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Israel is my son even my first-born.”2081 In the great song
he says “Rejoice O ye nations with His people and let all the sons of God be strong in
Him;”2082 and by the mouth of the prophet Isaiah He says “I have nourished and brought
up sons (children) and they have rebelled against me;”2083 and through the thrice blessed

David “I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the Most High,”2084 and to the
Romans the wise Paul wrote in this manner, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. For the Spirit itself
beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs;
heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with Him that we may be
also glorified together;”2085 and to the Galatians he writes “And because ye are sons God
hath sent forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou
art no more a servant but a son; and if a son then an heir of God through Jesus Christ.”2086
The lesson he gives to the Ephesians is “in love having predestinated us into the adoption
of children by Jesus Christ to Himself.”2087</p>
<p>If then, because the name of the Christ is common, we ought not to glorify the Christ
as God, we shall equally shrink from worshipping Him as Son, since this also is a name
which has been bestowed upon many. And why do I say the Son? The very name of God
itself has been given by God to many. “The Lord the God of gods hath spoken and called
the earth.”2088 And “I have said Ye are gods,”2089 and “Thou shalt not revile the gods.”2090
Many too have appropriated this name to themselves. The dæmons who have deceived
mankind have given this title to idols; whence Jeremiah exclaims, “The gods that have not
made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these
heavens;”2091 and again “They made to themselves gods of silver and gods of gold;”2092 and
the prophet Isaiah when he had mocked the making of the idols, and said “He burneth part
thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he warmeth himself and saith Aha I am
warm I have seen the fire,”2093 went on “and the residue thereof he maketh a god and falleth
down unto it and saith ‘Deliver me for thou art my god’”2094 and so the prophet laments

over them and says “Know that their heart is ashes.”2095 And the Psalmist David has taught
us to sing “For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.”2096</p>
<p>But this common use of titles gives no offence to men who are instructed in true religion.
We are aware that the dæmons have falsely bestowed upon themselves and on idols the divine
name, while the saints have received this honour of free grace.</p>
<p>In reality and by nature it is the God of all, and His only-begotten Son and the Holy
Spirit which are God. This is distinctly taught us by the admirable Paul in the words “For
though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many
and lords many, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we
in Him; and one Lord by whom are all things and we by Him.”2097 And the Holy Spirit is
called the Spirit of God and so also is the soul of man, for, it is written, “His breath goeth
forth,”2098 and “O ye spirits and souls of the righteous bless ye the Lord,”2099 and the
Psalmist David called the angels spirits. “Who maketh His angels spirits and His ministers
a flame of fire.”2100 Why indeed do I mention the angels and the souls of men? Even the
dæmons are so called by the Lord “He shall take unto him seven other spirits more wicked
than himself and they shall enter in, and the last state of that man shall be worse than the
first.”2101 But even this application of the name does not offend the pious reader, for the
Father and His only begotten Son and His Holy Spirit are one God by nature; and the divine
Word made man, our Lord Jesus Christ, is by nature one Son, only begotten of the Father;
and the Comforter who completes the number of the Trinity is one Holy Ghost. Thus though
many are named fathers, we worship one Father, the Father before the ages, who Himself
gave this title to men, as the Apostle says, “For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named.”2102 Let
us not then, because others are called christs, rob ourselves of the worship of our Lord Jesus
Christ. For just as though many are called gods and fathers, there is one God and Father
over all and before the ages; and though many are called sons, there is one real and natural
Son; and though many are styled spirits there is one Holy Ghost; just so though many are
called christs there is one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things. And very properly does

the Church cling to this name; for she has heard Paul, escorter of the Bride, exclaiming “I
have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,”2103
and again “Husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the Church,”2104 and again “For
this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.”2105 Listen to him as he says “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
being made a curse for us,”2106 and elsewhere “Know ye not that so many of us as were
baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized into His death,”2107 and in another place, “For as
many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ,”2108 and again “Put ye
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lust thereof.”2109</p>
<p>They who are blessed by the boons of God and have learnt to know these passages and
others like them, kindled with warm love for their bountiful Master, constantly carry on
their lips this His dearest name and cry in the words of the Song of Songs “My beloved is
mine and I am his;” “I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet
to my taste.”2110 And besides all this that name of ours which we love so well we have derived
from the name of Christ. We are called Christians.2111</p>

‘saints’ or the ‘brethren’ or the ‘believers,’ and the like. The biting gibes of the Antiochene populace which stung
to the quick successive emperors—Hadrian, M. Aurelius, Severus, Julian—would be little disposed to spare the
helpless adherents of this new ‘superstition.’ Objection indeed has been taken to the Antiochene origin of the
name on the ground that the termination is Roman, like Pompeianus, Cæsarianus, and the like. But this termination,
if it was Latin, was certainly Asiatic likewise, as appears from such words as ᾽Ασιανός, βακτριανός,
Σαρδιανός, Τραλλιανός, ᾽Αρειανός, Μενανδριανός, Σαβελλιανός. The next occurrence of the word in a Christian
document is on the occasion of St. Paul’s appearance before Festus (a.d. 60). It is not however put in the mouth
of a believer, but occurs in the scornful jest of Agrippa, ‘With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me
a Christian’ (Acts xxvi. 28). The third and last example occurs a few years later. In the first Epistle of St. Peter,
presumably about a.d. 66 or 67, the Apostle writes ‘Let not any of you suffer as a murderer or a thief…but if (he
suffers) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed but glorify God’ (iv. 15). Here again the term is not the Apostle’s
own, but represents the charge brought against the believers by their heathen accusers. In the New Testament</note>

<pb n="742"/>
<p>Of this name the Lord of all says, “The Lord God shall call His servants by another name
which shall be blessed on the earth”2112 and the following is the reason why the Church
specially clings to this name. When the only-begotten Son of God was made man, then He
was named Christ, then human nature received the beams of intellectual light; then the
heralds of the truth shed their beams upon the world. Teachers of the Church, however,
constantly used the names of the only begotten without distinction; at one time they glorify
the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost; at another the Father with Christ and the Holy
Ghost; yet as far as the sense is concerned there is here no difference. Wherefore after the
Lord had commanded to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost the blessed Peter said to them who received his preaching and asked what they must
do, “Believe and be baptized every one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,”2113 as
though this name contained in itself all the potency of the divine command. The same
teaching is clearly given us by the great Basil, luminary of the Cappadocians,2114 or rather
of the world. His words are “the name of Christ is the confession of the whole.” It indicates
at once the Father, who anointed, the Son, who was anointed, and the Holy Ghost whereby
He was anointed. Furthermore the thrice blessed Fathers assembled in council at Nicæa,
after saying that we must believe in one God, the Father, added “and in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the only begotten Son of God.” Thereby they teach that the Lord Jesus Christ is
Himself the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>To what has been said it must also be added that we must not affirm that after the ascension
the Lord Christ is not Christ but only begotten Son. The divine Gospels and the history
of the Acts and the Epistles of the Apostle himself were, as we know, written after the ascension.
It is after the ascension that the divine Paul exclaims “Seeing then that we have a great
High Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.”
2115 And again, “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which
are the figures of the true; but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for
<note type="footnote">there is no indication that the name was yet adopted by the disciples of Christ as their own. Thus Christian
documents again confirm the statement of Tacitus that as early as the Neronian persecution this name prevailed,
and the same origin also is indirectly suggested by those notices, which he directly states—not ‘qui sese appellabant
Christianos’ but ‘quos vulgus appellabat Christianos.’ It was a gibe of the common people against ‘the brethren.’”

anchor both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the
forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus made an High Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.”2117 And when, writing to the blessed Titus about the second advent he says,
“Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour
Jesus Christ.”2118 And to the Thessalonians he wrote in similar terms “For they themselves
show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how we turned to God from
idols to serve the living and true God; and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised
from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.”2119 And again “And
the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men,
even as we do toward you: to the end he may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness
before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.”2120
And again when writing to the same a second time he says, “Now we beseech you, brethren,
by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.”2121 And
a little further on when predicting the destruction of antichrist he adds, “Whom the Lord
shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his
coming.”2122 And when exhorting the Romans to concord he says, “But why dost thou judge
thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for we shall all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, as I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to
me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”2123 And the Lord Himself when announcing
His second advent besides other things says too this “Then if any man shall say unto you,
Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and
shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.”2124</p>

<p>And after the immortality and incorruptibility of His body He called Himself Son of
Man, naming Himself from the nature which was seen, inasmuch as the divine nature is
indeed invisible to angels, as the Lord Himself had said “No one hath seen God at any
time.”2125 And to the great Moses He said “There shall no man see me and live.”2126</p>
<p>The words “Henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known
Christ after the flesh; yet now henceforth know we Him no more,”2127 were not written by
the divine Apostle in order to annul the assumed nature, but for the confirmation of our
own future incorruption, immortality, and spiritual life.</p>
<p>The Apostle therefore continues “Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature;
old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.”2128 He speaks of what is to
be in the future as though it had already come to pass. We have not yet been gifted with
immortality, but we shall be; and when so gifted we shall not become bodiless, but we shall
put on immortality. “For” says the divine Apostle, “we would not be unclothed, but clothed
upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.”2129 And again “For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”2130 Thus he did not
speak of the Lord as bodiless, but taught us to believe that even the visible nature is incorruptible,
and glorified with the divine glory. This instruction he has given us yet more clearly
in the Epistle to the Philippians; “For our conversation” he writes “is in heaven; from whence
also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it
may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.”2131 By these words he teaches us distinctly
that the body of the Lord is a body, but a divine body, and glorified with the divine glory.</p>
<p>Let us, then, not shun the name whereby we enjoy salvation, and whereby all things are
made new, as says our teacher himself in his Epistle to the Ephesians,—“According to His
good pleasure which He hath purposed in Himself; that in the dispensation of the fulness
of time He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
which are on earth, even in Him.”2132 Let us rather learn from this blessed language how
we are bound to glorify our benefactor, by connecting the name of Christ with our God and
Father. In his Epistle to the Romans the Apostle says “my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus
Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world

began, but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the
commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith;
to God only will be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.”2133 Writing to the Ephesians
he thus gives praise—“Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory in the Church
by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”2134 And a little before he
says, “For this cause I bow my knee unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the
whole family in heaven and earth is named.”2135 And considerably farther on he says
“Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.”2136 And when he requites with benediction the liberality of the Philippians he says
“But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.”2137
And for the Hebrews he prayed, “Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus Christ, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do His will, working in you that which
is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.”2138 And not only when glorifying, but also when exhorting and protesting, the
Apostle conjoins the Christ with God the Father. To the blessed Timothy he exclaims “I
charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ.”2139 And again “I give thee
charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ, who before
Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; that thou keep this commandment without
spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; which in His times He shall
shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords; who only
hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man
hath seen, nor can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.”2140</p>

<head>CXLVII.2143To John, Bishop of Germanicia.</head>
<p>Immediately on receipt of your holiness’s former letter I replied. About the present state
of affairs, it is impossible to entertain any good hope. I apprehend that this is the beginning
of the general apostasy. For when we see that those who lament what was done as they say,
by violence, at Ephesus, show no signs of repentance, but abide by their unlawful deeds and
are building up a superstructure at once of injustice and of impiety; when we see that the
rest take no concerted action to deny their deeds and do not refuse to hold communion
with men who abide by their unlawful action, what hope of good is it possible for us to entertain?
Had they been expressing their admiration of what has happened as though all had
been well and rightly done, it would only have been proper for them to abide by what they
themselves commend. But if, as they say, they are lamenting what has been done and stating
it to have been done by force and violence, why in the world do they not repudiate what has
been unlawfully done? Why is the present, which lasts for such a little time, preferred before
what is sure to come to pass? Why in the world do they openly lie and deny that any innovation
has been introduced into doctrine? On account of what murders and witchcrafts have
I been expelled? What adulteries did the man commit? What tombs did the man violate? It
is perfectly clear even to outsiders that it was for doctrine that I and the rest were expelled.
Why the Lord Domnus too, because he would not accept “the Chapters”2144 was deposed
by these excellent persons who called them admirable and confessed that they abided by
them. I had read their propositions, and they rejected me as the head and front of the heresy
and expelled others for the same reason.2145</p>

<note type="footnote">2145 It has been pointed out before (Page 293) that at the Latrocinium Domnus was compelled to yield his
presidential seat as Patriarch of Antioch, Dioscorus presiding, the Roman legate sitting second, and Juvenal of
Jerusalem third. “Cowed by the dictatorial spirit of Dioscorus and unnerved by the outrageous violence of Barsumas
and his band of brutal monks he consented to revoke his former condemnation of Eutyches.” “This
cowardly act of submission was followed by a still baser proof of weakness, the condemnation of the venerable
Flavian. Dioscorus having thus by sheer intimidation obtained his ends revenged himself for their former opposition
to his wishes upon those whose cowardice had made them the instruments of his nefarious designs,
and proceeded to mete out to them the same measure they had dealt to Flavian. Domnus was the last to be deposed.
The charges alleged against him were his reported approval of a Nestorian sermon preached before him</note>

<p>What has happened proves plainly enough that they supposed the Saviour to have laid
down the law of practical virtue rather for Hamaxobians2146 than for them. When some
men had given in charges against Candidianus, the Pisidian,2147 accusing him of several
acts of adultery and other iniquities, it is said that the president of the council remarked, “If
you are bringing accusation on points of doctrine, we receive your charges; we have not
come here to decide about adulteries.” Accordingly Athenius and Athanasius2148 who had
been expelled by the Eastern Synod were bidden to return to their own churches; just as
though our Saviour had laid down no laws about conduct, and had only ordered us to observe
doctrines—which those most sapient persons have been foremost in corrupting. Let them
then cease to mock; let them no longer attempt to conceal the impiety which they have
confirmed by blows as well as by words. If this is not the case, let them tell us the reasons
of the massacres; let them own in writing the distinction between the natures of our Saviour,
and that the union is without confusion; let them declare that after the union both Godhead
and manhood remained unimpaired. “God is not mocked.”2149 Let the chapters be denied
which they have often repudiated, and now at Ephesus have sanctioned. Do not let them
trick your holiness by their lies. They used to praise my utterances at Antioch, being brethren,
and when made readers, and ordained deacons, presbyters and bishops; and at the end of
my discourse they used to embrace me and kiss me, on head, on breast, on hands; and some
of them would cling to my knees, calling my doctrine apostolic,—the very doctrine that they
have now condemned, and anathematized. They used to call me luminary, not only of the
East, but of the whole world, and now I forsooth have been proscribed and, so far as lies in
their power, I have not even bread to eat. They have anathematized even all who converse
with me. But the man whom but a little while ago they deposed and called Valentinian and
Apollinarian they have honoured as a martyr of the faith, rolling at his feet, asking his pardon
and calling him spiritual father. Do even woodlice change their colour to match the stones

<head>CL. Letter of Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, to Joannes, Bishop of Antioch.2152</head>
<p>I have been much distressed at reading the anathematisms which you have sent to request
me to refute in writing, and to make plain to all their heretical sense. I have been distressed
at the thought that one appointed to the shepherd’s office, entrusted with the charge of so
great a flock and appointed to heal the sick among his sheep, is both himself unsound, and
that to a terrible degree, and is endeavouring to infect his lambs with his disease and treats
the sheep of his folds with greater cruelty than that of wild beasts. They, indeed, tear and
rend the sheep that are dispersed and separated from the flock; but he in its very midst, and
while thought to be its saviour and its guardian introduces secret error among the victims
of their confidence in him. Against an open assault it is possible to take precautions, but
when an attack is made in the guise of friendship, its victim is found off his guard and hurt
is easily done him. Hence foes who make war from within are far more dangerous than
those who attack from without.</p>
<p>I am yet more grieved that it should be in the name of true religion and with the dignity
of a shepherd that he should give utterance to his heretical and blasphemous words, and
renew that vain and impious teaching of Apollinarius which was long ago stamped out.
Besides all this there is the fact that he not only supports these views but even dares to anathematize
those who decline to participate in his blasphemies;—if he is really the author of
these productions and they have not proceeded from some enemy of the truth who has
composed them in his name and, as the old story has it, flung the apple of discord2153 in
the midst, and so fanned the flame on high.</p>
<p>But whether this composition comes from himself or from some other in his name, I,
for my part, by the aid of the light of the Holy Ghost, in the investigation of this heretical
and corrupt opinion, according to the measure of the power given me, have refuted them
as best I could. I have confronted them with the teaching of evangelists and apostles. I have
exposed the monstrosity of the doctrine, and proved how vast is its divergence from divine
truth. This I have done by comparing it with the words of the Holy Spirit, and pointing out
what strange and jarring discord there is between it and the divine.</p>
<note type="footnote">2152 This letter may be dated in February 431. Celestine and Cyril had written to John of Antioch in relation
to the condemnation of Nestorius by the western bishops at Rome in August 430. Theodoret was at Antioch on
the arrival of these letters and hence additional probability is given to the theory that he wrote the reply referred
to in the preceding note. Then came the publication of Cyril’s chapter or anathemas which Theodoret undertook
to refute. Letter CL. is prefixed to his remarks on them.</note>
<note type="footnote">2153 The “old story” is a comparatively late addition to the myth of the marriage of Peleus.</note>

<pb n="753"/>
<p>Against the hardihood of this anathematizing, thus much I will say, that Paul, the clearvoiced
herald of truth, anathematized those who had corrupted the evangelic and apostolic
teaching and boldly did so against the angels, not against those who abided by the laws laid
down by theologians; these he strengthened with blessings, saying, “And as many as walk
according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy and on the Israel of God.”2154 Let then
the author of these writings reap from the Apostle’s curse the due rewards of his labours
and the harvest of his seeds of heresy. We will abide in the teaching of the holy Fathers.</p>
<p>To this letter I have appended my counter arguments, that on reading them you may
judge whether I have effectively destroyed the heretical propositions. Setting down each of
the anathematisms by itself, I have annexed the counter statement that readers may easily
understand, and that the refutation of the dogmas may be clear.2155</p>

<head>CLI. Letter or Address of Theodoret to the Monks of the Euphratensian, the Osrhoene, Syria,
Phoenicia, and Cilicia.2156</head>
<p>When I contemplate the condition of the Church at the present crisis of affairs,—the
tempest which has recently beset the holy ship, the furious blasts, the beating of the waves,
the deep darkness of the night, and, besides all this, the strife of the mariners, the struggle
going on between oarsmen, the drunkenness of the pilots, and, lastly, the untimely action
of the bad,—I bethink me of the laments of Jeremiah and cry with him, “my bowels, my
bowels! I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh a noise in me,”2157 and to put away
despondency’s great cloud by the drops from my eyes, I have recourse to founts of tears.
Amid a storm so wild it is fitting that the pilots be awake, to battle with the tempest, and
take heed for the safety of the ship: the sailors ought to cease from their strife, and strive to
undo the danger alike by prayer and skill: the mariners ought to keep the peace, and quarrel
neither with one another nor with the pilots, but implore the Lord of the sea to banish the
darkness by His rod. No one now is willing to do anything of the kind; and, just as happens
in a night-engagement, we cannot recognise one another, we leave our enemies alone, and
waste our weapons against our own side; we wound our comrades for foes, while all the
while the bystanders laugh at our drunken folly, enjoy our disasters, and are delighted to
see us engaged in mutual destruction. The responsibility for all this lies with those who have
striven to corrupt the apostolic faith, and have dared to add a monstrous doctrine to the
teaching of the Gospels; with them that have accepted the impious “Chapters” which they
have sent forth with anathematisms to the imperial city, and have confirmed them, as they
have imagined, by their own signatures. But these “Chapters” have sprouted without doubt
from the sour root of Apollinarius; they are tainted with Arian and Eunomian error; look
into them carefully, and you will find that they are not clear of the impiety of Manes and
Valentinus.2158</p>
<p>In his very first chapter he rejects the dispensation2159 which has been made on our
behalf, teaching that God the Word did not assume human nature, but was Himself changed

into flesh, thus laying down that the incarnation took place not in reality but in semblance
and seeming. This is the outcome of the impiety of Marcion, Manes, and Valentinus.</p>
<p>In his second and third chapters, as though quite oblivious of what he had stated in his
preface, he brings in the hypostatic union, and a meeting by natural union, and by these
terms he represents that a kind of mixture and confusion was effected of the divine nature
and of the form of the servant. This comes of the innovation of the Apollinarian heresy.</p>
<p>In his fourth chapter he denies the distinction of the terms of evangelists and apostles,
and refuses to allow, as the teaching of the orthodox Fathers has allowed, the terms of divine
dignity to be understood of the divine nature, while the terms of humility, spoken in human
sense, are applied to the nature assumed; whence the rightminded can easily detect the
kinship with impiety. For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to
be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to
His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference
of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible
and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This
goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not
been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature.
Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the
Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of
the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry
of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father.
This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while
yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is
cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own
ruin and to that of all who will listen to them. We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep
our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been
ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We
confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and
body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last
days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of
one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as
touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge
one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been
made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, “Destroy this
temple and in three days I will raise it up.”2160 If on the contrary there had been mixture
and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said “Destroy me
<note type="footnote">2160 John ii. 19</note>

<pb n="756"/>
and in three days I shall be raised.” But now, to show that there is a distinction between God
according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are “Destroy
this temple and in three days I will raise it up,” clearly teaching that it was not God who was
undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destruction,
while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in
obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That
our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John “In the beginning
was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning
with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was
made.”2161 And again, “That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world.”2162 And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, “He that hath seen me hath seen
the Father.”2163 And “I and my Father are one”2164 and “I am in the Father and the Father
in me,”2165 and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says “Who being the brightness
of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of
His power”2166 and in the epistle to the Philippians “Let this mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with
God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.”2167
And in the Epistle to the Romans, “Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the
flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever. Amen.”2168 And in the epistle to
Titus “Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ.”2169 And Isaiah exclaims “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called, Angel
of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, powerful, the Prince of Peace,
the Father of the Age to come.”2170 And again “In chains they shall come over and they
shall fall unto thee. They shall make supplication unto thee saying, surely God is in thee and
there is none else, there is no God. Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
the Saviour.”2171 The name Emmanuel, however, indicates both God and man, for it is in-

terpreted in the Gospel to mean “God with us,”2172 that is to say “God in man,” God in our
nature. And the divine Jeremiah too utters the prediction “This is our God and there shall
none other be accounted of in comparison with him. He hath found out all the way of
knowledge and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved and afterward
did He show Himself upon earth and conversed with men.”2173 And countless other passages
might be found as well in the holy gospels and in the writings of the apostles as in the predictions
of the prophets, setting forth that our Lord Jesus Christ is very God.</p>
<p>That after the Incarnation He is spoken of as Man our Lord Himself teaches in His
words to the Jews “Why go ye about to kill me?” “A man that hath told you the truth.”2174
And in the first Epistle to the Corinthians the blessed Paul writes “For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead,”2175 and to show of whom he is
speaking he explains his words and says, “For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all
be made alive.”2176 And writing to Timothy he says, “For there is one God and one mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”2177 In the Acts in his speech at Athens “The
times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent;
because He hath appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by
that man whom He hath ordained, whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that
He hath raised him from the dead.”2178 And the blessed Peter preaching to the Jews says,
“Ye men of Israel, hear these words Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you
by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by Him in the midst of you,”2179 and
the prophet Isaiah when predicting the sufferings of the Lord Christ, whom but just before
he had called God, calls man in the passage “A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.”
“Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.”2180 I might have collected other
consentient passages of holy Scripture and inserted them in my letter had I not known you

<p>We confess then that our Lord Jesus Christ is very God and very man. We do not divide
the one Christ into two persons, but we believe two natures to be united without confusion.
We shall thus be able without difficulty to refute even the manifold blasphemy of the heretics:
for many and various are the errors of those who have rebelled against the truth, as we shall
proceed to point out. Marcion and Manes deny that God the Word assumed human nature
and do not believe that our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin. They say that God the
Word Himself was fashioned in human form and appeared as man rather in semblance
than in reality.</p>
<p>Valentinus and Bardesanes admit the birth, but they deny the assumption of our nature
and affirm that the Son of God employed the Virgin as it were as a mere conduit.</p>
<p>Sabellius the Libyan, Photinus, Marcellus the Galatian, and Paul of Samosata say that
a mere man was born of the Virgin, but openly deny that the eternal Christ was God.</p>
<p>Arius and Eunomius maintain that God the Word assumed only a body of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Apollinarius adds to the body an unreasonable soul, as though the incarnation of God
the Word had taken place not for the sake of reasonable beings but of unreasonable, while
the teaching of the Apostles is that perfect man was assumed by perfect God, as is proved
by the words “Who being in the form of God took the form of a servant;”2182 for “form” is
put instead of “nature” and “substance” and indicates that having the nature of God He
took the nature of a servant.</p>
<p>When therefore we are disputing with Marcion, Manes and Valentinus, the earliest inventors
of impiety, we endeavour to prove from the divine Scriptures that the Lord Christ
is not only God but also man.</p>
<p>When, however, we are proving to the ignorant that the doctrine of Arius, Eunomius
and Apollinarius about the oeconomy is incomplete, we show from the divine oracles of the
Spirit that the assumed nature was perfect.</p>
<p>The impiety of Sabellius, Photinus, Marcellus, and Paulus, we refute by proving by the
evidence of divine Scripture that the Lord Christ was not only man but also eternal God, of
one substance with the Father. That He assumed a reasonable soul is stated by our Lord
Himself in the words “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father save me from
this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour.”2183 And again “My soul is exceeding

are dead which sought the young child’s soul (life A.V.)”2186 And the Evangelist says “Jesus
increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man.” Now what increases in
stature and wisdom is not the Godhead which is ever perfect, but the human nature which
comes into being in time, grows, and is made perfect.</p>
<p>Wherefore all the human qualities of the Lord Christ, hunger, I mean, and thirst and
weariness, sleep, fear, sweat, prayer, and ignorance, and the like, we affirm to belong to our
nature which God the Word assumed and united to Himself in effecting our salvation. But
the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves,
and all the other miracles we believe to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that
the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the
visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved
beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when
lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped
by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the
want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi
and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the
unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into Egypt and avoids the fury of Herod by
flight,2187 for He was man; but as the Prophet says “He shakes the idols of Egypt,”2188 for
He was by nature God. He is circumcised; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification,
because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and
afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver
and had promised by the prophets that He Himself would give it. He was baptized by John;
and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and
is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many
thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked
for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His
divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former
of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things
with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men
from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this
world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the
latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. “He was crucified,” as the blessed Paul
says “through weakness.”2189 But as the same Paul says “Yet He liveth by the power of

God.”2190 Let that word “weakness” teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the
Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened
by the power of God, was according to the Apostle’s teaching dead and buried, both death
and burial being proper to the form of the servant. “He broke the gates of brass and cut the
bars of iron in sunder”2191 and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His
own temple. These are proofs of the form of God in accordance with the Lord’s words
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”2192 Thus in the one Christ through
the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the
Godhead. We do not divide the two natures into two Christs, and we know that of the
Father God the Word was begotten and that of the seed of Abraham and David our nature
was assumed. Wherefore also the blessed Paul says when discoursing of Abraham “He saith
not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ,”2193 and writing
to Timothy he says “Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the
dead according to my gospel.”2194 And to the Romans he writes “Concerning His son Jesus
Christ<gap reason="omitted"/>which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.”2195 And again “Whose
are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.”2196 And the Evangelist
writes “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,”
2197 and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David “being a prophet and knowing that
God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ
to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spake of his resurrection,”2198 and God says to
Abraham “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,”2199 and Isaiah “There
shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and
there shall rest upon Him2200 the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel
and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall

shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be
glorious.”2202</p>
<p>From these quotations it is made plain that according to the flesh, the Christ was descended
from Abraham and David and was of the same nature as theirs; while according to
the Godhead He is Everlasting Son and Word of God, ineffably and in superhuman manner
begotten of the Father, and co-eternal with Him as brightness and express image and Word.
For as the word in relation to intelligence and brightness in relation to light are inseparably
connected, so is the only begotten Son in relation to His own Father. We assert therefore
that our Lord Jesus Christ is only begotten, and first born Son of God; only begotten both
before the incarnation and after the incarnation, but firstborn after being born of the Virgin.
For the name first-born seems to be in a sense contrary to that of only begotten, because
the only Son begotten of any one is called only begotten, while the eldest of several brothers
is called first-born. The divine Scriptures state God the Word alone to have been begotten
of the Father; but the only begotten becomes also first-born, by taking our nature of the
Virgin, and deigning to call brothers those who have trusted in Him; so that the same is
only begotten in that He is God, first born in that He is Man. Thus acknowledging the two
natures we adore the one Christ and offer Him one adoration, for we believe that the union
took place from the moment of the conception in the Virgin’s holy womb. Wherefore also
we call the holy Virgin both Mother of God2203 and Mother of man, since the Lord Christ
Himself is called God and man in the divine Scripture. The name Emmanuel proclaims the
union of the two natures. If we acknowledge the Christ to be both God and Man and so call
Him, who is so insensate as to shrink from using the term “Mother of man” with that of
“Mother of God”? For we use both terms of the Lord Christ. For this reason the Virgin is
honoured and called “full of grace.”2204 What sensible man then would object to name the
Virgin in accordance with the titles of the Saviour, when on His account she is honoured
by the faithful? For He who was born of her is not worshipped on her account, but she is
honoured with the highest titles on account of Him Who was born from her.</p>
<p>Suppose the Christ to be God only, and to have taken the origin of His existence from
the Virgin, then let the Virgin be styled and named only “Mother of God” as having given

birth to a being divine by nature. But if the Christ is both God and man and was God from
everlasting (inasmuch as He did not begin to exist, being co-eternal with the Father that
begat Him) and in these last days was born man of His human nature, then let him who
wishes to define doctrine in both directions devise appellations for the Virgin with the explanation
which of them befits the nature and which the union. But if any one should wish
to deliver a panegyric and to compose hymns, and to repeat praises, and is naturally anxious
to use the most august names; then, not laying down doctrine as in the former case, but
with rhetorical laudation, and expressing all possible admiration at the mightiness of the
mystery, let him gratify his heart’s desire, let him employ high names, let him praise and let
him wonder. Many instances of this kind are found in the writings of orthodox teachers.
But on all occasions let moderation be respected. All praise to him who said that “moderation
is best,” although he is not of our herd.2205</p>
<p>This is the confession of the faith of the Church; this is the doctrine taught by evangelists
and apostles. For this faith, by God’s grace I will not refuse to undergo many deaths. This
faith we have striven to convey to them that now err and stray, again and again challenging
them to discussion, and eager to show them the truth, but without success. With a suspicion
of their probably plain confutation, they have shirked the encounter; for verily falsehood is
rotten and yokefellow of obscurity. “Every one,” it is written “that doeth evil cometh not to
the light lest his deeds should be reproved”2206 by the light.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, after many efforts, I have failed in persuading them to recognise the
truth, I have returned to my own churches, filled at once with sorrow and with joy; with joy
on account of my own freedom from error; and with sorrow at the unsoundness of my
members. I therefore implore you to pray with all your might to our loving Lord, and to cry
unto Him, “‘Spare Thy people, O Lord and give not Thy heritage to reproach.’2207 Feed us
O Lord that we become not as we were in the beginning when Thou didst not rule over us
nor was Thy name invoked to help us. ‘We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a
scorn and derision to them that are round about us,’2208 because wicked doctrines have
come into Thy inheritance. They have polluted Thy holy temple in that the daughters of
strangers have rejoiced over our troubles. A little while ago we were of one mind and one
tongue and now are divided into many tongues. But, O Lord our God, give us Thy peace

than Thee. We call Thee by Thy name. ‘Make both one and break down the middle wall of

giveth His life for the sheep ’2212 ‘Awake, why sleepest Thou O Lord, arise cast us not off

waves.”</p>
<p>These words and words like these I implore you to utter to the God of all; for He is good
and full of loving-kindness and ever fulfils the will of them that fear Him. He will therefore
listen to your prayer, and will scatter this darkness deeper than the plague of Egypt. He will
give you His own calm of love, and will gather them that are scattered abroad and welcome
them that have been cast out. Then shall be heard “the voice of rejoicing and salvation in
the tabernacles of the righteous.”2214 Then shall we cry unto Him we have been “glad according
to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen
evil,”2215 and you when you have been granted your prayer shall praise Him in the words
“Blessed be God which not turned away my prayer nor His mercy from me.”2216</p>
<p>Proof that after the Incarnation our Lord Jesus Christ, was one Son.</p>
<p>The authors of slanders against me allege that I divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into
two sons. But so far am I from holding this opinion that I charge with impiety all who dare
to say so. For I have been taught by the divine Scripture to worship one Son, our Lord Jesus
Christ, the only begotten Son of God, God the Word incarnate. For we confess the same to
be both God eternal, and made man in the last days for the sake of man’s salvation; but
made man not by the change of the Godhead but by the assumption of the manhood. For
the nature of this godhead is immutable and invariable, as is that of the Father who begat
Him before the ages. And whatever would be understood of the substance of the Father will
also be wholly found in the substance of the only begotten; for of that substance He is begotten.

Father”2217 and again in another place “All things that the Father hath are mine,”2218 and
elsewhere “I and the Father are one,”2219 and very many other passages may be quoted setting
forth the identity of substance.</p>
<p>It follows that He did not become God: He was God. “In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.”2220 He was not man: He became
man, and He so became by taking on Him our nature: So says the blessed Paul—“Who being
in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no
reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant.”2221 And again: “For verily He took
not on Him the nature of angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham.”2222 And again;
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise
took part of the same.”2223 Thus He was both passible and impassible; mortal and immortal;
passible, on the one hand, and mortal, as man; impassible, on the other, and immortal, as
God. As God He raised His own flesh, which was dead;—as His own words declare: “Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”2224 And as man, He was passible and mortal
up to the time of the passion. For, after the resurrection, even as man He is impassible, immortal,
and incorruptible; and He discharges divine lightnings; not that according to the
flesh He has been changed into the nature of Godhead, but still preserving the distinctive
marks of humanity. Nor yet is His body uncircumscribed, for this is peculiar to the divine
nature alone, but it abides in its former circumscription. This He teaches in the words He
spake to the disciples even after His resurrection “Behold my hands and feet that it is I myself;
handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.”2225 While He
was thus beheld He went up into heaven; thus has He promised to come again, thus shall
He be seen both by them that have believed and them that have crucified, for it is written
“They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”2226 We therefore worship the Son, but we
contemplate in Him either nature in its perfection, both that which took, and that which
was taken; the one of God and the other of David. For this reason also He is styled both Son
of the living God and Son of David; either nature receiving its proper title. Accordingly the

divine scripture calls him both God and man, and the blessed Paul exclaims “There is one
God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a
ransom for all.”2227 But Him whom here he calls man in another place he describes as God
for he says “Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ.”2228 And yet in another place he uses both names at once saying
“Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.
Amen.”2229</p>
<p>Thus he has stated the same Christ to be of the Jews according to the flesh, and God
over all as God. Similarly the prophet Isaiah writes “A man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief.<gap reason="omitted"/>Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,”2230 and shortly afterwards
he says “Who shall declare His generation?”2231 This is spoken not of man but of God. Thus
through Micah God says “Thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the
princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel, whose
goings forth have been as of old from everlasting.”2232 Now by saying “From thee shall come
forth a ruler” he exhibits the oeconomy of the incarnation; and by adding “whose goings
forth have been as of old from everlasting” he declares the Godhead begotten of the Father
before the ages.</p>
<p>Since we have been thus taught by the divine scripture, and have further found that the
teachers who have been at different periods illustrious in the Church, are of the same opinion,
we do our best to keep our heritage inviolate; worshipping one Son of God, one God the
Father, and one Holy Ghost; but at the same time recognising the distinction between flesh
and Godhead. And as we assert them that divide our one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons
to trangress from the road trodden by the holy apostles, so do we declare the maintainers
of the doctrine that the Godhead of the only begotten and the manhood have been made
one nature to fall headlong into the opposite ravine. These doctrines we hold; these we
preach; for these we do battle.</p>
<p>The slander of the libellers that represent me as worshipping two sons is refuted by the
plain facts of the case. I teach all persons who come to holy Baptism the faith put forth at

Nicæa; and, when I celebrate the sacrament of regeneration I baptize them that make profession
of their faith in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, pronouncing
each name by itself. And when I am performing divine service in the churches it
is my wont to give glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost; not sons, but
Son. If then I uphold two sons, whether of the two is glorified by me, and whether remains
unhonoured? For I have not quite come to such a pitch of stupidity as to acknowledge two
sons and leave one of them without any tribute of respect. It follows then even from this
fact that the slander is proved slander,—for I worship one only begotten Son, God the Word
incarnate. And I call the holy Virgin “Mother of God”2233 because she has given birth to
the Emmanuel, which means “God with us.”2234 But the prophet who predicted the Emmanuel
a little further on has written of him that “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given; and the government shall be upon his shoulders; and his name is called Angel of great
counsel, wonderful, counsellor, mighty God, powerful, Prince of peace, Father of the age to
come.”2235 Now if the babe born of the Virgin is styled “Mighty God,” then it is only with
reason that the mother is called “Mother of God.” For the mother shares the honour of her
offspring, and the Virgin is both mother of the Lord Christ as man, and again is His servant
as Lord and Creator and God.</p>
<p>On account of this difference of term He is said by the divine Paul to be “without father,
without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.”2236 He
is without father as touching His humanity; for as man He was born of a mother alone. And
He is without mother as God, for He was begotten from everlasting of the Father alone. And
again He is without descent as God while as man He has descent. For it is written “The book
of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham.”2237 His descent is
also given by the divine Luke.2238 So again, as God, He has no beginning of days for He was
begotten before the ages; neither has He an end of life, for His nature is immortal and impassible.
But as man He had both a beginning of days, for He was born in the reign of Augustus
Cæsar, and an end of life, for He was crucified in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar. But
now, as I have already said, even His human nature is immortal; and, as He ascended, so
again shall He come according to the words of the Angel—“This same Jesus which is taken
up from you into Heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into Heaven.”

Irenæus,2252 of Methodius2253 and Hippolytus,2254 and the rest of the teachers of the Church.
In a word I assert that I follow the divine oracles and at the same time all these saints. By
the grace of the spirit they dived into the depths of God-inspired scripture and both themselves
perceived its mind, and made it plain to all that are willing to learn. Difference in
tongue has wrought no difference in doctrine, for they were channels of the grace of the
divine spirit, using the stream from one and the same fount.</p>

<head>CLII. Report of the (Bishops) of the East to the Emperor, giving information of their proceedings,
and explaining the cause of the delay in the arrival of the Bishop of Antioch.2255</head>
<p>In obedience to the order of your pious letter we have journeyed to the Ephesian metropolis.
There we have found the affairs of the Church in confusion, and disturbed by internecine
war. The cause of this is that Cyril of Alexandria and Memnon of Ephesus have banded
together and mustered a great mob of rustics, and have forbidden both the celebration of
the great feast of Pentecost, and the evening and morning offices.2256</p>
<p>They have shut the sacred churches and martyrs’ shrines; they have assembled apart
with the victims of their deceit; they have wrought innumerable iniquities, trampling under
foot alike the canons of the holy Fathers, and your own decrees. And the action has been
taken in face of the order given both in writing and by word of mouth by the most excellent
count Candidianus,2257 envoy of your Christ-loving majesty, that the council must await
the arrival of the very holy bishops, coming from all quarters of the Empire, and then and
not till then formally assemble in obedience to your piety’s commands. Moreover Cyril of
Alexandria had written to me, the bishop of Antioch, two days before the meeting of their
synod, that the whole council was awaiting my arrival. We have therefore deposed both the
aforenamed, Cyril and Memnon, and have excluded them from all the services of the church.
The rest, who have participated in their iniquity, we have excommunicated, until they shall
reject and anathematize the Chapters2258 issued by Cyril, which are full of the Eunomian
and Arian heresies, and shall, in obedience to your piety’s command, assemble together
with us, and shall in an orderly manner and with all exactitude, together with ourselves,
examine into the questions at issue, and confirm the pious doctrine of the holy Fathers.</p>
<p>As to the delay in my own arrival be it known to your piety that, in consideration of the
distance of the way by land,—and this was our route,—I have come very quickly, I have
travelled forty stages without pausing to rest on the way; so your Christian majesty may
learn from the inhabitants of the towns on the route. Besides this I was detained many days
in Antioch by the famine there; by the daily tumults of the people; and by the unusual
<note type="footnote">2255 Cyril’s party met on June 22, 431,—numbering 198, in the Church of the Virgin. John of Antioch with
his fourteen supporters did not arrive till the 27th. Unable to start from their diocese before April 26, the octave
of Easter, they did not assemble at Antioch till May 10, and then were delayed by a famine. Immediately on their
arrival the “Conciliabulum” of the 43 anti-Cyrillians met with indecent precipitancy.</note>
<note type="footnote">2256 Both parties, regarding their opponents as excommunicate, forbade them to perform their sacred functions.</note>

<head>CLIII. Report of the same to the Empresses Pulcheria and Eudoxia.</head>
<p>We had expected to be able to report to your pious majesties in different terms, but we
are now compelled to make known to you the following facts, forced as we are by the irregular
exercise of despotic power by Cyril of Alexandria and Memnon of Ephesus. The proper
course to have been pursued, in accordance with the laws of the Church, and the command
of your pious majesties, would have been to wait for the arrival of the godly bishops on the
road, and in common with them to examine into the questions at issue concerning the true
faith, and investigate the point offered for discussion, and, after exact enquiry, to confirm
the doctrines of the apostles. They had written to me that they would wait for our arrival.
They heard that we were only three stages off. Then they assembled an unconstitutional
council by themselves, and have ventured on proceedings iniquitous, irregular, and bristling
with absurdities. And this they have done though the most honourable count Candidianus,
sent by your pious and Christian majesties for good order’s sake, expressly charged them,
alike in writing and by word of mouth, to wait for the arrival of the godly bishops who had
been convened, and to attempt no innovation on the true faith, but to take their stand on
the directions of our godly-minded sovereigns. Now in spite of their having heard the imperial
letter and the advice of the most honourable count Candidianus, they have nevertheless
made naught of due order. As the prophet says “They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the
spider’s web; and he that would eat of their eggs when he breaks them findeth rottenness,
and therein is a viper,”2259 Wherefore we confidently cry “Their webs shall not become
garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works.”2260</p>
<p>They have shut the churches and the martyrs’ shrines; they have forbidden the celebration
of the holy feast of Pentecost; besides this they have sent the minions of their disorderly
despotism into bishops’ private houses, uttering shocking threats, and forcing them to affix
their signatures to illegal acts. We therefore considering all their preposterous conduct, have
deposed the aforenamed Cyril and Memnon, and deprived them of their episcopate. Their
associates in irregularity, whether influenced by sycophancy or by fear, we have excommunicated,
until, coming to a knowledge of their own wounds, they shall heartily repent, shall
anathematize the heretical Chapters of Cyril, which are tainted with the heresy of Apollinarius,
Arius, and Eunomius, shall recover the faith of the Fathers in Council at Nicæa, and,
in obedience to the pious commands of our Christian sovereigns, shall, peacefully and
without any tumult, assemble in synod, be willing to examine with care the questions submitted
to them, and honestly protect the purity of the faith of the Gospel.</p>

<head>CLVII. Report of the Council of (the Bishops of) the East to the Victorious Emperor, announcing
a second time the deposition of Cyril and of Memnon.2264</head>
<p>Your piety, which shines forth for the good of the empire and of the churches of God,
has commanded us to assemble at Ephesus, in order to bring about peace and gain for the
Church, rather than to confuse and disturb it. And the commands of your majesty plainly
and distinctly indicate your pious and peaceful intentions for the churches of Christ. But
Cyril of Alexandria, a man, it would seem, born and bred for the bane of the churches, after
taking into partnership the audacity of Memnon of Ephesus, has first of all transgressed
against your quieting and pious decree, and has so shewed his general depravity. Your
majesty had ordered an investigation and careful testing to be made concerning the faith,
and that with the consent and concord of all. Cyril, challenged, or rather himself convicting
himself, on the count of the Apollinarian doctrines, by means of the letter which he lately
sent to the imperial city, with anathematisms, whereby he is convicted of sharing the views
of the impious and heretic Apollinarius, pays no heed to this condition of things, and, as
though we were living with no emperor to govern us, is proceeding to every kind of lawlessness.
He ought himself to be called to account for his unsound opinion about our Lord Jesus
Christ; but, usurping an authority given him neither by the canons, nor by your edicts, he
is hurrying headlong into every kind of disorder and illegality.</p>
<p>Moved by these things the holy Synod, which has refused to accept his devices for the
damage of the faith, for the aforesaid reasons deposes him. It deposes Memnon also, who
has been his counsellor and abettor through all, who has kept up constant agitation against
the very holy bishops for refusing to assent to his pernicious heterodoxy; who has shut the
churches and every place of prayer, as if we were living among the heathen and the enemies
of God; who has brought in the Ephesian mob, so that every day we are in supreme danger,
while we look not to defence, but heed the right doctrines of true religion. For the destruction
of these men is identical with the establishment of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>From his own Chapters your majesty can have no difficulty in perceiving his impious
mind. He is convicted of trying, so to say, to raise from Hades the impious Apollinarius,
who died in his heresy, and of attacking the churches and the orthodox faith. He is shewn
in his publications to anathematize at once evangelists and apostles and them that succeeded
them as forefathers of the Church, who, moved not by their own imaginations, but by the
holy Spirit, have preached the true faith, and proclaimed the gospel; a faith and gospel indeed
opposed to what this man holds and teaches and by inculcating which he wishes to give his

own private iniquity the mastery of the world. Since this is intolerable to us we have followed
the proper course, relying at once on the divine grace and on your majesty’s good will.</p>
<p>We know that you give to nothing higher honour than to the sacred faith in which both
you and your thrice blessed forefathers have been brought up. From them you have received
the perpetual sceptre of empire, ever putting down the opponents of the apostolic doctrines.
Such an opponent is the aforesaid Cyril, who, with the aid of Memnon, has captured Ephesus
as he might some fortress, and justly shares with his ally the sentence of deposition. Justly:
for, besides all that has been said, they have boldly tried every means of assault and every
violence against us, who, to come together in council in ratification of your edict, have disregarded
every claim of home and country and self.</p>
<p>We are now the prey of tyranny, unless your piety intervene and order us to assemble
in some other place, near at hand, where we shall be able, from the scriptures, and from the
writings of the Fathers, to refute beyond contradiction both Cyril and the victims of his ingenuity.
We have mercifully expelled these men from communion with the suggested hope
of salvation in case they should repent; although, as if on some campaign of uncivilized
soldiery, they have up to this moment furnished him with the means of his illegality. Some
were deposed long ago, and have been restored by Cyril. Some have been excommunicated
by their own metropolitans, and admitted by him again into communion. Others have been
impaled on various accusations, and have been promoted by him to honour. All through,
the main motive of his action has been the endeavour to achieve his heretical purpose by
the force of numbers, for he does not reckon as he ought that in what relates to true religion,
it is not numbers that are required, but rather correctness of doctrine and the truth of the
doctrine of the apostles. Men are needed who are competent to establish these points not
by audacity and masterful self-assertion but by pious use of apostolic testimony and example.</p>
<p>For all these reasons we beseech and implore your majesty to bear prompt aid to assaulted
truth, and to remedy without delay these men’s masterful readiness; for, like a hurricane, it
is sweeping the less moderate among us into pernicious heresy. Your piety has had care for
the churches in Persia and among the barbarians; it is only right that you should not neglect
those which are tossed by the storm within the boundaries of the Roman empire.</p>

<head>CLVIII. Report of (the Bishops of) the East to the Very Pious Emperor, which they delivered
with the preceding Report to the Right Honourable Count Irenæus.</head>
<p>On receiving the letter of your piety we entertained hopes that the Egyptian storm which
has lately struck the churches of God would be driven away. But we have been disappointed.
Those men have been made even yet more daring by their madness; they have given no
heed to the sentence of deposition justly and in due forth passed upon them, nor have become
any more moderate in consequence of the rebuke of your majesty. They have trampled
down alike the laws of your piety, and the canons of the holy Fathers, and, some of them
being deposed and some excommunicated, keep festivals, and celebrate communion, in
Houses of Prayer. And we, as we have already informed your Christ-loving majesty, on the
receipt of your clemency’s kindly letter, though our only desire was to pray in the church
of the Apostles, have not only been prevented, but actually stoned, and chased for a considerable
distance, so that we were compelled to effect our safety by flight at full speed. Our
opponents on the contrary think that they may act just as they please. They have declined
to make investigation of the questions at issue, and to undertake the defence of Cyril’s
heretical Chapters, rejecting the plain proofs of the impiety which they contain. They are
impudent from mere impudence, while the examination of the questions before us requires
not impudence, but calmness, knowledge, and skill in matters of doctrine.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances we have been under the necessity of sending forward the
most honourable Count Irenæus, to approach your piety, and to explain the position of affairs.
He has accurate information concerning all that has occurred, and has learned from
us many modes of cure, whereby it may be possible to bring about the restoration of tranquillity
to the holy churches of God. We beseech your clemency to grant him patient audience,
and to give orders for the prompt carrying out of whatever measures may seem good
to your piety, that we be not here crushed beyond all endurance.</p>

<p>Writing from Ephesus I salute your holiness, I congratulate you on your infirmity, and
deem you dear to God, in that you have known what evil deeds have been going on here by
report, and not by personal experience. Evil indeed! They transcend all imagination and all
incidents of history; they compel a continual downpour of tears. The body of the Church
is in peril of dismemberment;—nay, rather I may say it has received the first incision;—unless
the wise Healer restore and re-connect the unsound and severed limbs. Once again the
Egyptian is raging against God, and warring with Moses and Aaron His servants, and the
more part of Israel are on the side of the foe; for all too few are the sound who willingly
suffer for true religion’s sake. Ancient principles are trodden under foot. Deposed men
perform priestly functions, and they who have deposed them sit sighing at home. Men excommunicated
by the same sentence as the deposed have relieved the deposed of their deposition
of their own free will. Such is the mockery of a synod held by Egyptians, by
Palestinians, by men from the Pontic and Asian dioceses, and by the West in their company.2269</p>
<p>What players in a pantomime, in the days of paganism, even in any farce so held up
religion to ridicule? Indeed what farce-writer ever performed such a play? What dramatist
ever wrote so sad a tragedy? Such and so great are the troubles that have beset God’s Church,
whereof I have narrated but a very small part.</p>

<head>CLXIII. First Letter of the Commissioners of the East, sent to Chalcedon, among whom was

<p>On our arrival at Chalcedon, for neither we ourselves nor our opponents were permitted
to enter Constantinople, on account of the seditions of the excellent monks, we heard that
eight days before we had appeared (behold the glory of the most pious prince) the lord
Nestorius was dismissed from Ephesus, free to go where he would; whereat we are much
distressed, since verily deeds done illegally and informally now seem to have some force.
Let your holiness however be assured that we shall eagerly join the battle for the Faith, and
are willing to fight even unto death. To-day, the 11th of the month Gorpiæum,2271 we are
expecting our very pious Emperor to cross over to the Rufinianum,2272 and there to hear
the trial.</p>
<p>We therefore beg your holiness to pray the Lord Christ to help us to be able to confirm
the faith of the holy Fathers, and to pluck up by the roots these Chapters which have sprouted
to the damage of the Church. We implore your holiness to think and act with us, and to
abide in your ready devotion to the orthodox faith. When this letter was written the lord
Himerius2273 had not yet met us, being peradventure hindered on the road. But do not let
this trouble you. Only let your piety strenuously support us, and we trust that gloom will

<p>Through the prayers of your holiness our most pious prince has granted us an audience,
and by God’s grace we have got the better of our opponents, as all our views have been accepted
by the most Christ-loving emperor. The reports of others were read, and what seemed
unfit to be received, and had no further importance, he rejected. They were full of Cyril,
and petitioned that he might be summoned to give an account of himself. So far they have
not prevailed, but have heard discourses on true religion, that is on the system of the Faith,
and that the faith of the blessed Fathers was confirmed. We further refuted Acacius2275 who
had laid down in his Commentaries that the Godhead is passible. At this our pious emperor
was so shocked at the enormity of the blasphemy that he flung off his mantle, and stepped
back. We know that the whole assembly welcomed us as champions of true religion.</p>
<p>It has seemed good to our most pious emperor that anyone should explain his own
views, and report them to his piety. We have replied that it is impossible for us to make any
other exposition than that made by the blessed Fathers at Nicæa, and so it has pleased his
majesty. We therefore offered the form subscribed by your holiness. Moreover, the whole
population of Constantinople is continually coming out to us to implore us to fight manfully
for the Faith. We do our best to restrain them, to avoid giving offence to our opponents.

<p>To the very pious bishops now in Ephesus: Johannes, Himerius, Paulus, Apringius,
Theodoretus, greeting. For the fifth time an audience has been granted us. We entered
largely into the question of the heretical Chapters, and swore again and again to the very
pious emperor that it was impossible for us to hold communion with our opponents unless
they rejected the Chapters. We pointed out moreover that even if Cyril did abjure his
Chapters he could not be received by us, because he had become the heresiarch of so impious
a heresy. Nevertheless we gained no ground, because our adversaries were urgent, and their
hearers could neither restrain them in their insolent endeavour, nor compel them to come
to enquiry and argument. They thus evade the investigation of the Chapters, and allow no
discussion concerning them. We, however, as you entreat, are ready to insist to the death.
We refuse to receive Cyril and his Chapters; we will not admit these men to Communion
till the improper additions to the Faith be rejected. We therefore implore your holiness to
continue to show at once our mind and our efforts. The battle is for true religion; for the
only hope we have,—on account of which we look forward to enjoying, in the world to
come, the loving-kindness of our Saviour. As to the very pious and holy bishop Nestorius,
be it known to your piety that we have tried to introduce a word about him, but have hitherto
failed, because all are ill-affected toward him. We will notwithstanding do our best, though
this is so, to take advantage of any opportunity that may offer, and of the goodwill of the
audience, to carry out this purpose, God helping us. But that your holiness may not be ignorant
of this too, know that we, seeing that the partisans of Cyril have deceived everyone
by domineering, cheating, flattering, and bribing, have more than once besought the very
pious emperor and most noble princes both to send us back to the East, and let your holiness
go home. For we are beginning to learn that we are wasting time in vain, without nearing
our end, because Cyril everywhere shirks discussion, in his conviction that the blasphemies
published in his Twelve Chapters can be openly refuted. The very pious emperor has determined,
after many exhortations, that we all go every one to his own home, and that, further,
both the Egyptian and Memnon of Ephesus are to remain in their own places. So the
Egyptian will be able to go on blindfolding by bribery. The one, after crimes too many to
tell, is to return to his diocese. The other, an innocent man, is barely permitted to go home.
We and all here salute you and all the brotherhood with you.</p>

<head>CLXVI. First Petition of the Commissioners, addressed from Chalcedon, to the Emperor.</head>
<p>It had been much to be desired that the word of true religion should not be adulterated
by ridiculous explanations, and least of all by men who have obtained the priesthood and
high office in the churches, and who have been induced, we know not how, by ambition,
by lust of authority, and by certain poor promises, to despise all the commandments of
Christ. Their only motive has been the desire to pay court to a man who has the presumption
to hope that he and his abettors will be able to manage the whole business with success; I
mean Cyril of Alexandria. Of his own frivolity he has intruded into the holy churches of
God heretical doctrines which he believes himself able to support by argument. He expects
to escape the chastisement of sinners by the sole help of Memnon and the bishops of the
aforesaid conspiracy.</p>
<p>We are lovers of silence; in general we advise a philosophic course of action. Now,
however, sensible that to be silent and to cultivate philosophy would be to throw away the
Faith, we turn in supplication to you who, next to the Goodness on high, are the sole pre-
server of the world. We know that it specially belongs to you to be anxious for true religion,
as having, up to this present day, continually protected it, and being in turn protected by it.</p>
<p>We beg you therefore to receive this treatise, as though our defence were to be pleaded
in the presence of the most holy God; not because we are less active in the sacred cause, but
because we are devoted to true religion, and are speaking in its behalf. For in Christian times
the clergy have no more bounden duty than to bear testimony before so faithful a prince,
however ready we might have been to yield our bodies and to lay down our lives a thousand
times in the battle for the faith. We therefore beseech you by God who seeth all things, by
our Lord Jesus Christ who will judge all men in righteousness, by the Holy Ghost by whose
grace you hold your empire, and by the elect angels who are your guardians and whom one
day you shall see standing by the awful throne, and ceaselessly offering unto God that dread
doxology which it is now sought to corrupt; we beseech your piety, besieged as you now are
by the craftiness of certain men who are forbidding access to you, and are supporting the
introduction into the faith of heretical Chapters, utterly at variance with sound doctrine,
and tainted with heresy, to order all who subscribe them, or assent to them, and wish, after
your promised pardon, to dispute further, to come forth and submit to the discipline of the
Church. Nothing, sir, is more worthy of an emperor than to fight for the truth, for which
you hurried to join battle with Persians and other barbarians, when Christ granted you to
win fair victories in acknowledgment of your zeal towards Him. We beseech you that the
questions at issue may be put before your piety in writing, for thus their purport will be
more easily perceived, and the transgressors will be convicted for all future time. If however
anyone, heedless of the utterances for which he shall be at fault, shall wish by his teaching
to prevail over the right faith, it will be the part of your justice and judgment to consider
whether the very name of teachers has not been thrown away by men who are reluctant to

<pb n="786"/>
run any risks concerning the doctrines which they introduce, refusing to be obedient to
your orders, that they may escape conviction for having done wrong; nor reckoning them
worth refutation, that their mutual conspiracy be not proved fruitless. For now it is clear,
from those that have been ordained by them that some of them, in return for this impiety,
have bethought them of obliging certain persons by the concession of dignities and have
devised certain other means. This will become still more clear; and your piety will soon see
that they will distribute the rewards of their treachery, as though they were the spoils of the
faith of Christ.</p>
<p>But we, of whom some were long ago ordained by the very pious Juvenal, bishop of
Jerusalem, have kept silence, although it was our duty to contend for the canon, that we
might not seem to be troubled for our own reputation’s sake. We are now perfectly well
aware of his active trickery through Phoenicia Secunda and Arabia. We really have not time
to attend to such things. We are men who have preferred rather to be deprived of the very
places of which the ministry has been entrusted to us, and so of our life, than of our ready
zeal for the faith. To the attempts of those men we will oppose the sentence of God and of
your piety.</p>
<p>Now also we beg that true religion may be your one and primary care, and that the
brightness of orthodoxy, which at length with difficulty blazed forth in the days of Constantine
of holy name, was maintained by your blessed grandfather and father, and was extended
by your majesty among the Persians and other barbarians, be not allowed to grow
dim in the very innermost courts of your imperial palace, or, in your serenity’s days, to be
dispersed.</p>
<p>You will not send, sir, a divided Christianity into Persia; nor here at home will there be
anything great, while we are distressed by disputes, and while there is no one existing on
their side to settle them; no one will take part in a divided Word and Sacraments; no one
without loss of faith will cut himself off from such famous fathers and saints who have
never been condemned. No imperial successes will be permitted to a people at variance
among themselves; a burst of derision will be roused from the enemies of true religion; and
all the other noxious consequences of their malignant controversy are too numerous to
reckon.</p>
<p>If there is anyone who thinks little of the science of theology, let that one be any one in
the world rather than he to whom the Lord has given the supreme government of the world.
Our petition is that your piety will give judgment, for God will guide your intelligence into
exact comprehension. Finally, should this be impracticable (and all the engagements of your
piety we cannot know) we beseech your serenity to give us leave to travel safely home. We
are aware that to the dioceses entrusted to us cause of offence is given by so protracted a

<pb n="787"/>
delay, on account of those men who even in sacred matters look out for opportunities of
dissension whence no advantage can be derived.</p>

<head>CLXVII. Second Petition of the same, sent from Chalcedon to Theodosius Augustus.</head>
<p>Your piety has been informed on several occasions, both by ourselves in person and by
our emissaries, that the doctrine of the true faith seems to stand in danger of being corrupted,
and that the body of the Church is apparently being rent asunder by men who are turning
everything upside down, trampling upon all church order, and all imperial law, and
throwing everything into confusion that they may confirm the heresy propounded by Cyril
of Alexandria. For when we were first summoned by your piety to Ephesus, to enquire into
the question which had arisen and to confirm the evangelic and apostolic faith laid down
by the holy Fathers, before the arrival of all the bishops who had been convened, the holders
of their own private Council confirmed in writing the heretical Chapters, which are at one
with the impiety of Arius, Eunomius and Apollinarius. Some they deceived; some they terrified;
others already charged with heresy, they received into communion; and others who
had not communicated with them were bribed into so doing; others again were fired with
the hope of dignities for which they were unfit; so these men gathered round them a great
crowd of adherents, as though they had no idea that true religion is shewn not by numbers,
but by truth.</p>
<p>The dispatch of your piety was read a second time by the most honourable Count
Candidianus, ordering that the questions recently raised be examined in a quiet and brotherly
manner. When however all the pious bishops were assembling, the reading had no effect.</p>
<p>Then came the noble Palladius Magistrianus, bringing another dispatch from your
majesty, to the effect that all enactments passed privately and apart must be rescinded; that
the Council must be assembled afresh and the true doctrine ratified; but, as usual, this your
pious mandate was treated with contempt by these unscrupulous persons.</p>
<p>Then again arrived the right honourable Master John, at that time “Comes Largitionum,”
bringing another pious letter to the effect that the depositions of the three had been decreed,
that the offences which had sprung up were to be removed, and the faith laid down at Nicæa
by the holy and blessed Fathers was to be ratified by all. As usual these universal mockers
transgressed this law too.</p>
<p>For after hearing the letter they did not change their mode of action; they held communion
with the deposed; spoke of them as bishops, and refused to allow the Chapters, which
had been propounded to the loss and corruption of the pious faith to be rejected; notwithstanding
their having been frequently summoned by us to discussion. For we had ready to
hand a plain refutation of the heretical Chapters.</p>
<p>In evidence of these statements we have the right honourable Master, who when both
sides had been summoned a third and a fourth time, not venturing to make this conduct
an excuse on account of their disobedience, thought it worth while to summon us hither.</p>
<p>We came at once; on our arrival we allowed ourselves no rest making our petition, both
before your piety and before the illustrious assembly, that they would take up the quarrel

<pb n="789"/>
for the Chapters and enter into discussion concerning them, or on the other hand reject
them as contrary to the right faith, abiding by the faith as laid down by the blessed fathers
in council at Nicæa.</p>
<p>They refused to do anything of the kind; they persisted in their heretical procedure; yet
they were allowed to attend the churches, and to perform their priestly functions. We,
however, alike at Ephesus and here, have been for a long time deprived of communion; alike
there and here we have undergone innumerable perils; and while we were being stoned and
all but slain by slaves dressed up as monks, we took it all for the best, as willingly enduring
such treatment in the cause of the truth.</p>
<p>Afterwards it seemed good to your majesty that we and the opposite party should assemble
once again, that the recalcitrant might be compelled to examine the doctrines. While
we were waiting for this to come to pass your piety set out for the city, and ordered the very
men who were being accused of heresy and had been therefore some of them deposed by
us, and others excommunicated and thereafter to be subjected to the discipline of the Church,
to come to the city and perform priestly functions, and ordain.2277 We however who in the
cause of true religion have undertaken a struggle so tremendous; we who have shrunk from
no peril in our battle for right doctrine, have neither been bidden to enter the city to serve
the cause of the imperilled Faith and strive for orthodoxy; nor have we been permitted to
return home;2278 but here we are in Chalcedon distressed and groaning for the Church
oppressed by schism.</p>
<p>Wherefore since we are in receipt of no reply we have thought it necessary to inform
your piety by this present letter, before God and Christ and the Holy Ghost, that if any one
shall have been ordained (before the settlement of right doctrines) by these men of heretical
opinions, he must necessarily be cut off from the whole church, as well from the clergy as
the dissentient laity. For none of the pious will endure that communion be granted to
heretics, and their own salvation be nullified.</p>
<p>And when this shall have come to pass, then your piety shall be compelled to act against
your will. For the schism will grow beyond all expectation, and thereby the champions of
true religion will be saddened, unable to endure the loss of their own souls, and the establishment
of those impious doctrines of Cyril which the contentious are desirous of defending.</p>
<p>Many indeed of the supporters of true religion will never allow the acceptance of Cyril’s
doctrines; we shall never allow it, who all are of the diocese of the East of your province, of
the diocese of Pontus, of Asia, of Thrace, of Illyricum and of the Italies, and who also sent
to your piety the treatise of the most blessed Ambrose, written against this nascent superstition.</p>

<pb n="790"/>
<p>To avoid all this, and the further troubling of your piety, we beg, beseech, and implore
you to issue an edict that no ordination take place before the settlement of the orthodox
faith, on account of which we have been convened by your Christ-loving highness.</p>

<head>CLXVIII. Third Demand of the same, addressed from Chalcedon to the Sovereigns.</head>
<p>We never expected the summons of your piety to meet with this result. We were honourably
convoked, as priests by prince; we were convoked to ratify the faith of the holy
Fathers; and therefore, in due obedience to a pious prince, we came. On our arrival we were
no less faithful to the Church, not less respectful to your edict. From the day of our arrival
at Ephesus till the present moment we have without intermission followed your behests.</p>
<p>As it seems, however, our moderation, in these times, has not been of the slightest use
to us; nay, rather, so far as we can see, it has stood very much in our way. We indeed who
have thus behaved have been up to the present time detained in Chalcedon; and now we
are told that we may go home. They however who have thrown everything into confusion,
who have filled the world with tumult, who are striving to rend churches in twain, and who
are the open assailants of true religion, perform priestly functions, crowd the churches, and
as they imagine have authority to ordain, though in truth it is illegally claimed by them, stir
up seditions in the church, and what ought to be spent upon the poor they throw away upon
their bullies.</p>
<p>But you are not only their emperor; you are ours too. For no small portion of your empire
is the East, wherein the right faith has ever shone, and, besides, the other provinces and
dioceses from which we have been convened.</p>
<p>Let not your majesty despise the faith which is being corrupted, in which you and your
forefathers have been baptized; on which the Church’s foundations are laid; for which most
holy martyrs have rejoiced to suffer countless kinds of death; by aid of which you have
vanquished barbarians and destroyed tyrants; which you are needing now in your war for
the subjugation of Africa. For on your side will fight the God of all if you struggle on behalf
of His holy doctrines and forbid the dismemberment of the body of the church: for dismembered
it will be if the opinion prevail which Cyril has introduced into the Church and
other heretics have confirmed.</p>
<p>To these truths we have often already borne testimony before God both in Ephesus and
in this place. I have furnished information to your holiness, giving an account as before the
God of all. For this is required of us, as is taught in the divine Scripture both by prophets
and apostles; as says the blessed Paul “I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth
the dead, and of Lord Jesus Christ, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;”
2279 and as God charged Ezekiel to announce to the people, adding threats and saying,
“when thou givest him not warning,<gap reason="omitted"/>his blood will I require at thine hand.”2280</p>
<p>In awe of this sentence, once again we inform your majesty that they who have been
permitted to hold churches, and who teach the doctrines of Apollinarius, Arius, and Euno-
<note type="footnote">2279 1 Tim. vi. 13</note>
<note type="footnote">2280 Ez. iii. 18</note>

<pb n="792"/>
mius, perform all sacred functions irregularly and in violation of the canons, and destroy
the souls of all who approach them; if, indeed, any shall be found willing to listen to them.
For by the grace of God whose Providence is over all, and who wishes all men to be saved,
the more part of the people is sound, and warmly attached to pious doctrines. It is on their
account that we grieve.</p>
<p>And in our anguish and alarm lest the plague creeping on by little and little should attack
more, and the evil become general, we thus instruct your serenity, and continue to give you
exhortation; we implore your majesty to yield to our prayers and to prohibit any addition
to be made to the Faith of the holy Fathers assembled in council at Nicæa.</p>
<p>And if after this our entreaty your piety reject this doctrine, which was given in the
presence of God, we will shake off the dust of our feet against you, and cry with the blessed
Paul, “We are pure from your blood.”2281 For we cease not night and day from the moment
of our arrival at this distinguished council to bear witness to prince, nobles, soldiers, priests
and people, that we hold fast the Faith delivered to us by the Fathers.</p>

<head>CLXIX. Letter written by Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, from Chalcedon to Alexander of
Hierapolis.2282</head>
<p>We have left no means untried, of courtesy, of sternness, of entreaty, of eloquence before
the most pious emperor, and the illustrious assembly, testifying before God who sees all
things and our Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the world in justice,2283 and the Holy
Spirit and his elect angels, lest the Faith be despised which is now being corrupted by the
maintainers and bold subscribers of heretical doctrines: and that charge be given for it to
be laid down in the same terms as at Nicæa and for the rejection of the heresy introduced
to the loss and ruin of true religion. Up to this time however we have produced not the
slightest effect, our hearers being carried now in one direction and now in another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless all these difficulties have not been able to deter me from urging my point,
but by God’s grace I have pressed on. I have even stated to our pious emperor with an oath
that it is perfectly impossible for Cyril and Memnon to be reconciled with me, and that we
can never communicate with any one who has not previously repudiated the heretical
Chapters. This then is our mind. The object of men who “seek their own not the things
which are Jesus Christ’s”2284 is to be reconciled with them against our will. But this is no
business of mine, for God weighs our motives and tries our character, nor does He inflict
chastisement for what is done against our will. Be it known to your holiness that if ever I
said a word about our friend2285 either before the very pious emperor or the illustrious assembly,
I was at once branded as a rebel. So intensely is he hated by the court party. This is
most annoying. The most pious emperor, especially, cannot bear to hear his name mentioned
and says publicly “Let no one speak to me of this man.” On one occasion he gave an instance
of this to me. Nevertheless as long as I am here I shall not cease to serve the interests of this
our father, knowing that the impious have done him wrong.</p>
<p>My desire is that both your piety and I myself get quit of this. No good is to be hoped
from it, in as much as all the judges trust in gold, and contend that the nature of the Godhead
and manhood is one.</p>
<p>All the people however by God’s grace are in good case, and constantly come out to us.
I have begun to discourse to them and have celebrated very large communions.</p>
<p>On the fourth occasion I spoke at length about the faith and they listened with such
delight that they did not go away till the seventh hour but held out even till the midday heat.

An enormous crowd was gathered in a great court, with four verandahs, and I preached
from above from a platform near the roof.</p>
<p>All the clergy with the excellent monks are on the contrary utterly opposed to me, so
that when we came back from the Rufinianum, after the visit of the very pious emperor,
stone throwing began and many of my companions were wounded, by the people and false
monks.</p>
<p>The very pious emperor knew that the mob was gathered against me and coming up to
me alone he said, “I know that you are assembling improperly.” Then, said I, “As you have
allowed me to speak hear me with favour. Is it fair for excommunicated heretics to be doing
duty in churches, while I, who am fighting for the Faith and am therefore excluded by others
from communion, am not allowed to enter a church?” He replied “What am I to do?” I said,
“What your comes largitionum did at Ephesus. When he found that some were assembling,
but that we were not assembling, he stopped them saying, ‘If you are not peaceful I will allow
neither party to assemble.’ It would have become your piety also to have given directions
to the bishop here to forbid both the opposite party and ourselves to assemble before our
meeting together to make known your righteous sentence to all.” To this he replied “It is
not for me to order the bishop;” and I answered “Neither shall you command us, and we
will take a church, and assemble. Your piety will find that there are many more on our side
than on theirs.” In addition to this I pointed out that we had neither reading of the holy
Scripture, nor oblation; but only “prayer for the Faith and for your majesty, and pious conversation.”
So he approved, and made no further prohibition. The result is that increased
crowds flock to us, and gladly listen to our teaching. I therefore beg your piety to pray that
our case may have an issue pleasing to God. I am in daily danger, suspecting the wiles of
both monks and clergy, as I witness alike their influence and their negligence.</p>

<head>CLXX. Letter of certain Easterns, who had been sent to Constantinople, to Bishop Rufus.</head>
<p>To our most godly and holy fellow-minister Rufus, Joannes, Himerius, Theodoretus,
and the rest, send greeting in the Lord.2286</p>
<p>True religion and the peace of the Church suffer, we think, in no small degree, from the
absence of your holiness. Had you been on the spot you might have put a stop to the disturbances
which have arisen, and the violence that has been ventured on, and might have fought
on our side for the subjection of the heresies introduced into the orthodox Faith, and that
doctrine of apostles and evangelists which, handed down from time to time from father to
son, has at length been transmitted to ourselves.</p>
<p>And we do not assert this without ground, for we have learnt the mind of your holiness
from the letter written to the very godly and holy Julianus, bishop of Sardica, for that letter
as is right charged the above named very godly bishop to fight for the Faith laid down by
the blessed fathers assembled in council at Nicæa, and not to allow any corruption to be
introduced into those invincible definitions which are sufficient at once to exhibit the truth
and to refute falsehood. So your holiness rightly, justly, and piously advised, and the recipient
of the letter followed your counsel. But many of the members of the council, to use the word
of the prophet, “have gone aside,” and have “altogether become filthy,”2287 for they have
abandoned the Faith which they received from the holy Fathers, and have subscribed the
twelve Chapters of Cyril of Alexandria, which teem with Apollinarian error, are in agreement
with the impiety of Arius and Eunomius, and anathematize all who do not accept their unconcealed
unorthodoxy. To this plague smiting the Church vigorous resistance has been
offered by us who have assembled from the East, and others from different dioceses, with
the object of securing the ratification of the Faith delivered by the blessed Fathers at Nicæa.
For in it, as your holiness knows, there is nothing lacking whether for the teaching of
evangelic doctrines, or for the refutation of every heresy.</p>
<p>For the sake of this Faith we continue to struggle, despising alike all the joys and sorrows
of mortal life, if only we may preserve untouched this heritage of our fathers. For this reason
we have deposed Cyril and Memnon; the former as prime mover in the heresy, and the latter
<note type="footnote">2286 After pointing out that superscription, style, expression, sentiments, and circumstances all indicate
Theodoret as the writer of this letter, Garnerius proceeds “The objection of Baronius that mention is made of
Martinus, bishop of Milan, when there never was a Martinus bishop of Milan, is not of great importance.
Theodoret at a distance might easily write Martinus for Martinianus, or a copyist might abbreviate the name to
this form.” The date of the letter is marked as after the order to the bishops to remain at Constantinople, and
before permission was given them to return home. The Letters were also written to Martinianus of Milan, to
John of Ravenna, and to John of Aquileia, but only that to Rufus is extant. Rufus is probably the bishop of
Thessalonica.</note>
<note type="footnote">2287 Ps. xiv. 3</note>

<pb n="796"/>
as his aider and abettor in all that has been done to ratify and uphold the Chapters published
to the destruction of the Church. We have also excommunicated all that have dared to
subscribe and support these impious doctrines till they shall have anathematized them, and
returned to the Faith of the Fathers at Nicæa.</p>
<p>But our long-suffering has done them no good. To this day they continue to do battle
for those pernicious doctrines and have impaled themselves on the law of the canon which
distinctly enacts “If any bishop deposed by a synod, or presbyter or deacon deposed by his
own bishop, shall perform his sacred office, without waiting for the judgment of a synod,
he is to have no opportunity for defending himself, not even in another synod: but also all
who communicate with him are to be expelled from the church.” Now this law has been
broken both by the deposed and the excommunicate. For immediately after the deposition
and the excommunication becoming known to them, they performed sacred functions, and
they continue to do so, in plain disbelief of Him who said “Whatsoever ye shall bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven.”2288</p>
<p>With this we have thought well to acquaint your holiness at once, but in expectation of
some favourable change, we have waited up to the present time. But we have been disappointed.
They have continued to fight for this impious heresy, and pay no attention to the
counsels of the very pious emperor. On five separate occasions he has met us, and ordered
them either to reject the Chapters of Cyril as contrary to the Faith, or to be willing to do
battle in their behalf, and to shew in what way they are in agreement with the confession of
the Fathers. We have our proofs at hand, whereby we should have shewn that they are totally
opposed to the teaching of orthodoxy, and for the most part in agreement with heresy.</p>
<p>For in these very Chapters the author of the noxious productions teaches that the
Godhead of the only begotten Son suffered, instead of the manhood which He assumed for
the sake of our salvation, the indwelling Godhead manifestly appropriating the sufferings
as of Its own body, though suffering nothing in Its own nature; and further that there is
made one nature of both Godhead and manhood,—for so he explains “The Word was made
flesh,”2289 as though the Godhead had undergone some change, and been turned into flesh.</p>
<p>And, further, he anathematizes those who make a distinction between the terms used
by apostles and evangelists about the Lord Christ, referring those of humiliation to the
manhood, and those of divine glory to the Godhead, of the Lord Christ. It is with these views
that Arians and Eunomians, attributing the terms of humiliation to the Godhead, have not
shrunk from declaring God the Word to be made and created, of another substance, and
unlike the Father.</p>
<note type="footnote">2288 Matt. xviii. 18</note>
<note type="footnote">2289 John i. 14</note>

<pb n="797"/>
<p>What blasphemy follows on these statements it is not difficult to perceive. There is introduced
a confusion of the natures, and to God the Word are applied the words “My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me;”2290 and “Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from
me,”2291 the hunger, the thirst, and the strengthening by an angel; His saying “Now is my
soul troubled,”2292 and “my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,”2293 and all similar
passages belonging to the manhood of the Christ. Any one may perceive how these
statements correspond with the impiety of Arius and Eunomius; for they, finding themselves
unable to establish the difference of substance, connect, as has been said, the sufferings, and
the terms of humiliation, with the Godhead of the Christ.</p>
<p>And be your reverence well assured that now in their churches the Arian teachers preach
no other doctrine than that the supporters of the “homousion” at present hold the same
views as Arius, and that, after long time, the truth has now at last been brought to light.</p>
<p>We on the contrary abide in the teaching, and follow in the pious footprints, of the
blessed Fathers assembled at Nicæa, and of their illustrious successors, Eustathius of Antioch,
Basil of Cæsarea, Gregory, John, Athanasius, Theophilus, Damasus of Rome, and Ambrose
of Milan. For all these, following the words of the apostles, have left us an exact rule of orthodoxy,
which all we of the East earnestly desire to preserve unmoved. The same is the
wish of the Bithynians, the Paphlagonians, of Cappadocia Secunda, Pisidia, Mysia, Thessaly,
and Rhodope, and very many more of the different provinces. The Italians too, it is evident,
will not endure this new-fangled doctrine; for the very godly and holy Martinus,2294 bishop
of Milan, has written a letter to us, and has sent to the very pious emperor a work by the
blessed Ambrose on the incarnation of the Lord, of which the teaching is opposed to these
heretical Chapters.</p>
<p>And be it known to your holiness that Cyril and Memnon have not been satisfied with
corrupting the orthodox Faith, but have trampled all the canons underfoot. For they have
received into communion men excommunicated in various provinces and dioceses. Others
lying under charges of heresy, and of the same mind as Celestius and Pelagius, (for they are
Euchitæ, or Enthusiasts2295) and therefore excommunicated by their diocesans and metropolitans,
they have, in defiance of all ecclesiastical discipline received into communion, so

denial of the former of original sin and the depreciation by the latter of baptism as producing no results.</note>

swelling their following from all possible quarters, and shewing their eagerness to enforce
their teaching less by piety than by violence. For when they had been stripped bare of piety
they devised, in their extremity, another sort of force,—walls of flesh, with the idea that by
their showers of bribery they might vanquish the faith of the Fathers. But so long as your
holiness puts forth your strength, and you continue to fight, as you are wont, in defence of
true religion, none of these devices will be of the least avail. We exhort you therefore, most
holy sir, to beware of the communion of the unscrupulous introducers of this heresy; and
to make known to all, both far and near, that these are the points for which the thrice blessed
Damasus deposed the heretics Apollinarius, Vitalius, and Timotheus; and that the Epistle
in which the writer has concealed his heresy and coloured it with a coating of truth, must
not in simplicity be received. For in the Chapters he has boldly laid bare his impiety, and
dared to anathematize all who disagree with him, while in the letter he has vilely endeavoured
to harm the simpler readers.</p>
<p>Your holiness must therefore beware of neglecting this matter, lest when, too late, you
see this heresy confirmed, you grieve in vain, and suffer affliction at being no longer able
to defend the cause of truth.</p>
<p>We have also sent you a copy of the memorial which we have given to the most pious
and Christ-loving emperor, containing the faith of the holy Fathers at Nicæa. wherein we
have rejected the newly-invented heresies of Cyril, and adjudged them to be opposed to the
orthodox faith.</p>
<p>Since in accordance with the orders of the very pious emperor only eight of us travelled
to Constantinople, we have subjoined the copy of the order given us by the holy synod, that
you may be acquainted with the provinces contained in it. Your holiness will learn them
from the signatures of the metropolitans. We salute the brotherhood which is with you.</p>

<head>CLXXI. Letter of Theodoret to John, Bishop of Antioch, after the Reconciliation.2296</head>
<p>God, who governs all things in wisdom, who provides for our unanimity, and cares for
the salvation of His people, has caused us to be assembled together, and has shewn us that
the views of all of us are in agreement with one another. We have assembled together, and
read the Egyptian Letter;2297 we have carefully examined its purport, and we have discovered
that its contents are quite in accordance with our own statements, and entirely opposed to
the Twelve Chapters, against which up to the present time we have continued to wage war,
as being contrary to true religion. Their teaching was that God the Word was carnally made
flesh; that there was an union of hypostasis, and that the combination in union was of nature,
and that God the Word was the first-born from the dead. They forbade all distinction in
the terms used of our Lord, and further contained other doctrines at variance with the seeds
sown by the apostles, and outcome of heretical tares. The present script, however, is beautified
by apostolic nobility of origin. For in it our Lord Jesus Christ is exhibited as perfect God
and perfect man; it shews two natures, and the distinction between them; an unconfounded
union, made not by mixture and compounding, but in a manner ineffable and divine, and
distinctly preserving the properties of the natures; the impassibility and immortality of God
the Word; the passibility and temporary surrender to death of the temple, and its resurrection
by the power of the united God; that the holy Spirit is not of the Son, nor derives existence
from the Son, but proceeds from the Father, and is properly stated to be of the Son, as being
of one substance.2298 Beholding this orthodoxy in the letter, we have hymned Him who
heals our stammering tongues, and changes our discordant noises into the harmony of sweet
music.2299</p>
<note type="footnote">2296 This Letter appears to be that of the Euphratensian synod. (“probat prmum hæc vox ἐν κοινῷ, in conventu:

when John of Antioch visited Acacius at Beroea, after the Orientals had accepted Cyril’s formula of faith. Schulze would
rather place it after the negotiations were over.</note>

<head>CLXXII. Letter of Theodoretus to Nestorius.2300</head>
<p>To the very reverend and religious lord and very holy Father, Nestorius, the bishop
Theodoretus sends greeting in the Lord. Your holiness is, I think, well aware that I take no
pleasure in cultivated society, nor in the interests of this life, nor in reputation, nor am I
attracted by other sees. Had I learnt this lesson from no other source, the very solitude of
the city2301 over which I am called to preside would suffice to teach me this philosophy. It
is not indeed distinguished only for solitude, but also by very many disturbances which may
check the activity even of those who most delight in them.</p>
<p>Let no one therefore persuade your holiness that I have accepted the Egyptian writings
as orthodox, with my eyes shut, because I covet any see. For really, to speak the truth, after
frequently reading and carefully examining them, I have discovered that they are free from
all heretical taint, and I have hesitated to put any stress upon them, though I certainly have
no love for their author, who was the originator of the disturbances which have agitated the
world. For this I hope to escape punishment in the day of Judgment, since the just Judge
examines motives. But to what has been done unjustly and illegally against your holiness,
not even if one were to cut off both my hands would I ever assent, God’s grace helping me
and supporting my infirmity. This I have stated in writing to those who require it. I have
sent to your holiness my reply to what you wrote to me, that you may know that, by God’s
grace, no time has changed me like the centipedes and chameleons who imitate by their
colour the stones and leaves among which they live. I and all with me salute all the Brotherhood
who are with you in the Lord.</p>

falsehood,—although now refuted assertion of the falsehood is approved,—and the power
of truth has been shewn. For, lo, they, who by their impious reasoning had confused the
natures of our Saviour Christ, and dared to preach one nature, and therefore insulted the
most holy and venerable Nestorius, high priest of God, their mouths held, as the prophet
says, with bit and bridle2304 and turned from wrong to right, have once again learnt the
truth, adopting the statement of him who in the cause of truth has borne the brunt of the
battle. For instead of one nature they now confess two, anathematizing all who preach
mixture and confusion. They adore the impassible Godhead of Christ; they attribute passion
to the flesh; they distinguish between the terms of the Gospels, ascribing the lofty and divine
to the Godhead, and the lowly to the manhood. Such are the writings now brought from
Egypt.</p>

<head>CLXXIV. To Himerius, Bishop of Nicomedia.2305</head>
<p>We wish to acquaint your holiness that on reading and frequently discussing the letter
brought from Egypt we find it in harmony with the doctrine of the Church. Of the twelve
Chapters we have proved the contrary, and up to the present time we continue to oppose
them. We have therefore determined, if your holiness has recovered the churches divinely
entrusted to you, that you ought to communicate with the Egyptians and Constantinopolitans
and others who have fought with them against us, because they have professed to hold our
faith, or I should rather say the faith of the apostles; but not to give your consent to the alleged
condemnation of the very holy and venerable Nestorius. For we hold it impious and unjust
in the case of charges in which both appeared as defendants to lavish favour on the one and
shut the door of repentance on the other. Far more unjust and impious is it to condemn an
innocent man to death. Your holiness should be assured that you ought not to communicate
with them before you have recovered your churches. For this not only I but all the holy
bishops of our district decreed in the recent Council.</p>

<p>Be it known to your holiness that when I read the letter addressed to the emperor I was
much distressed, because I know perfectly well that the writer of the letter, being of the same
opinions, has unwisely and impiously condemned one who has never held or taught anything
contrary to sound doctrine. But the form of anathema, though it be more likely than his
assent to the condemnation, to grieve a reader, nevertheless has given me some ground of
comfort, in that it is laid down not in wide general terms, but with some qualification. For
he has not said “We anathematize his doctrine” but “whatever he has either said or held
other than is warranted by the doctrine of the apostles.”</p>

rejoice, although he did withhold his consent from our statement. He requires further subscription
to the condemnation which has been passed, and that the doctrine of the holy

without distinction, the doctrine of that most holy and venerable bishop, it is just the same
as though he seemed to anathematize true religion.</p>

<p>At last and with difficulty the villain has gone. The good and the gentle pass away all

<note type="footnote">2312 This letter is inserted in the Act. Synod. (vide Mans. ix. 295) as addressed to John, but Garnerius, with
general acceptance, has substituted Domnus. Its genuineness was contested by Baronius (an. vi. 23) not only
on the ground of its ascription to John who predeceased Cyril four years; but also because its expressions are at
once too Nestorian in doctrine and too extreme in bitterness to have been penned by Theodoret. Garnerius is
of opinion that the extreme Nestorianism and bitterness of feeling are no arguments against the authorship of
Theodoret; and, as we have already had occasion to notice, our author can on occasion use very strong language,
as for instance in Letter CL. p. 324, where he alludes to Cyril as a shepherd not only plague smitten himself but
doing his best to inflict more damage on his flock than that caused by beast of prey, by infecting his charge with
his disease. “It must be needless to add that Cyril’s character is not to be estimated aright by ascribing any serious
value to a coarse and ferocious invective against his memory, which was quoted as Theodoret’s in the fifth
General Council (Theodor. Ep. 180; see Tillemont, xiv. 784). If it were indeed the production of the pen of
Theodoret, the reputation which would suffer from it would assuredly be his own.” Canon Bright. Dict. Christ.
Biog. I. “The long and bitter controversy in which both parties did and said many things they must have had cause deeply
to regret, was closed by the death of Cyril, June 9, or 27, 444. With Baronius, ‘the cautious’ Tillemont, Cardinal Newman
and Dr. Bright, we should be glad to ‘utterly scout’ the idea, that the ‘atrocious letter’ on Cyril’s death ascribed to Theodoret
by the Fifth OEcumenical Council (Theod. ed. Schulze, Ep. 180; Labbe, v. 507) which he was said to have delivered by
way of pæan (Bright u. s. 176) and ‘the scarcely less scandalous’ sermon (ib.) can have been written by him. ‘To treat it
as genuine would be to vilify Theodoret.’ ‘The Fathers of the Council’ writes Dr. Newman ‘are no authority on such a
matter’ (Hist. Sketches p. 359). A painful suspicion of their genuineness, however, still lingers and troubles our conception
of Theodoret. The documents may have been garbled, but the general tone too much resembles that of undisputed polemical
writings of Theodoret’s to allow us entirely to repudiate them. We wish we could. Neander (vol. iv. p. 13, note,
Clark’s tr.) is inclined to accept the genuineness of the letter, the arguments against which he does not regard as carrying
conviction, and to a large extent deriving their weight from Tillemont’s ‘Catholic standpoint.’ That Theodoret should
speak in this manner of Cyril’s character and death cannot, he thinks, appear surprising to those who, without prejudice,
contemplate Cyril and his relations to Theodoret. The playful description, after the manner of Lucian, of a voyage to the
Shades below, is not to be reckoned a very sharp thing even in Theodoret. The advice to put a heavy stone over his grave
to keep Cyril down is sufficient proof that the whole is a bitter jest. The world felt freer now Cyril was gone; and he does
not shrink from telling a friend that he could well spare him. ‘The exaggeration of rhetorical polemics requires many
grains of allowance.’” Canon Venables. Dict. Christ. Biog. iv.</note>

virtue. They, on the other hand, who love and practise wickedness are allowed a little longer
to enjoy this present life, either that sated with evil they may afterwards learn virtue’s lessons,
or else even in this life may pay the penalty for the wickedness of their own ways by being
tossed to and fro through many years of this life’s sad and wicked waves.</p>
<p>This wretch, however, has not been dismissed by the ruler of our souls like other men,
that he may possess for longer time the things which seem to be full of joy. Knowing that
the fellow’s malice has been daily growing and doing harm to the body of the Church, the
Lord has lopped him off like a plague and “taken away the reproach from Israel.”2313 His
survivors are indeed delighted at his departure. The dead, maybe, are sorry. There is some
ground of alarm lest they should be so much annoyed at his company as to send him back
to us, or that he should run away from his conductors like the tyrant of Cyniscus in Lucian.2314</p>
<p>Great care must then be taken, and it is especially your holiness’s business to undertake
this duty, to tell the guild of undertakers to lay a very big and heavy stone upon his grave,
for fear he should come back again, and show his changeable mind once more. Let him take
his new doctrines to the shades below, and preach to them all day and all night. We are not
at all afraid of his dividing them by making public addresses against true religion and by
investing an immortal nature with death. He will be stoned not only by ghosts learned in
divine law, but also by Nimrod, Pharaoh and Sennacherib, or any other of God’s enemies.</p>
<p>But I am wasting words. The poor fellow is silent whether he will or no, “his breath
goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.”2315 He is doomed
too to silence of another kind. His deeds, detected, tie his tongue, gag his mouth, curb his
passion, strike him dumb and make him bow down to the ground.</p>
<p>I really am sorry for the poor fellow. Truly the news of his death has not caused me
unmixed delight, but it is tempered by sadness. On seeing the Church freed from a plague
of this kind I am glad and rejoice; but I am sorry and do mourn when I think that the wretch
knew no rest from his crimes, but went on attempting greater and more grievous ones till
he died. His idea was, so it is said, to throw the imperial city into confusion by attacking
true doctrines a second time, and to charge your holiness with supporting them. But God
saw and did not overlook it. “He put his hook into his nose and his bridle into his lips,”2316

<head>CLXXXI. Letter to Abundius, Bishop of Como.2317</head>
<p>To my dear lord and very holy brother Abundius Theodoretus sends greeting in the
Lord. I have discovered that your piety religiously preserves the true and apostolic faith;
and I have thanked Almighty God that the truth which was in peril has been renewed and
brought to light by your holiness.</p>
<p>Of old, after the flood, it came to pass that Noah and his sons were left for seed of the
human race. Just so in our own day are reserved the fathers of the West, that by them the
holy churches of the East may be able to preserve that true religion which has been threatened
with devastation and destruction by a new and impious heresy. Well may we quote those
words of the prophet “Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we
should have been as Sodom and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.”2318 So upon
us from this impious heresy the wrath of God has fallen like a flood and invasion.</p>
<p>Now we acknowledge the presence of our Saviour in a human body, and one Son of
God, His perfect Godhead and His perfect manhood. We do not divide our one Lord Jesus
Christ into two sons for He is one; but we recognise the distinction between God and man;
we know that one is of the Father, the other of the seed of David and Abraham, according
to the divine Scriptures, and that the divine nature is free from passion, the body which was
before subject to passion being now itself too free from passion; for after the resurrection
it is plainly delivered from all passion.</p>
<p>This we have learnt from the letter of the very holy and religious Archbishop our lord
Leo. For we have read what he wrote to Flavianus, of holy and blessed memory, and have
thanked the loving-kindness of the Lord because we have found an advocate and defender
of the truth. To this letter I have given my adhesion, and have subjoined a copy of it to my
present epistle, which I have also subscribed and have thereby proved that I obey the
apostolic rules, that is true doctrines; that I abide in them to this day, and am suffering in
their cause.</p>
<p>Assent has also been given by my lord Ibas and my lord Aquilinus against whom the
inventors of the new heresy have armed the imperial power.</p>
<note type="footnote">2317 This letter may be dated from Nicerte in the autumn of 450 when Abundius was at Constantinople on
a mission from Leo, after the failure to get Theodosius to agree to the summary of the Council in the West.
Theodosius died a few days after the arrival of the envoys at Constantinople. Theodoret is anxious to encourage
the Roman Legates to support the orthodox cause in the Imperial city, to repair the mischief caused by the
Latrocinium, and to show the court that he and his friends Ibas and Aquilinus had the support of Leo.
Abundius, fourth bishop of Como (450–469) represented Leo at Chalcedon. Manzoni, in the Promessi Sposi,
reminds us of the local survival of the name.</note>

to drive away the war that threatens it. Banish the impious party which has been roused

Lord, Who has promised to grant this boon, the fruits of your apostolic labours.</p>
<p>All the very religious and godly presbyters and reverend deacons and brethren by your
holiness I greet; and I and all who are with me salute your reverence.2319</p>
<note type="footnote">2319 After all the storms of controversy and quarrel which we have followed in the course of the dialogues
and letters of the Blessed Bishop of Cyrus; after the lurid leap of grim pleasantry which, if not actually penned
by Theodoret, indicates a temper that must have often shown itself in these troubled times; there is something
pathetic and encouraging in the conciliatory conclusion of this last letter. Cyril has been dead for years, and his
weaknesses are forgotten in a confession which his more moderate opponents could accept. The subscription
of Theodoret to the tome of Leo is an earnest of harmony and concord. The calmer wisdom of the West asserts
the truth which underlay the furious disputes of the subtler East. The last word of the drama is Peace.</note>

<p>JEROME AND GENNADIUS
LIVES OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN.</p>
<p>Translated, with Introduction and Notes,
by
ERNEST CUSHING RICHARDSON, PH.D.
LIBRARIAN OF PRINCETON COLLEGE.</p>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<head>Jerome and Gennadius.
Lives of Illustrious Men.</head>
<head>I. Introduction.</head>
<p>This combined work of Jerome and Gennadius is unique and indispensable in the history
of early Christian literature, giving as it does a chronological history in biographies of ecclesiastical
literature to about the end of the fifth century. For the period after the end of Eusebius’
Church History it is of prime value.</p>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<head>1. Time and Place of Composition, and Character.</head>
<p>1. The work of Jerome was written at Bethlehem in 492. It contains 135 writers from
Peter up to that date. In his preface Jerome limits the scope of his work to those who have
written on Holy Scriptures, but in carrying out his plans he includes all who have written
on theological topics; whether Orthodox or Heretic, Greek, Latin, Syriac, and even Jews and
Heathen (Josephus, Philo, Seneca). The Syriac writers mentioned are however few. Gennadius
apologizes for the scanty representation which they have in Jerome on the ground that the
latter did not understand Syriac, and only knew of such as had been translated.</p>
<p>The motive of the work was, as the preface declares, to show the heretics how many and
how excellent writers there were among the Christians. The direct occasion of the undertaking
was the urgency of his friend Dexter, and his models were first of all Suetonius, and then
various Greek and Latin biographical works including the Brutus of Cicero.</p>
<p>Jerome expressly states in his preface that he had no predecessor in his work, but very
properly acknowledges his indebtedness to the Church History of Eusebius, from whom he
takes much verbatim. The first part of the work is taken almost entirely from Eusebius.</p>
<p>The whole work gives evidence of hasty construction (e.g., in failure to enumerate the
works of well-known writers or in giving only selections from the list of their writings) but
too much has been made of this, for in such work absolute exhaustiveness is all but impossible,
and in the circumstances of those days, such a list of writers and their works is
really remarkable. He apologizes in the preface for omitting such as are not known to him
in his “Out of the way corner of the earth.” He has been accused of too great credulity, in
accepting e.g., the letters of Paul to Seneca as genuine, but on the other hand he often shows
himself both cautious (Hilary, Song of S.) and critical (Minutius Felix De Fato).</p>
<p>The work was composed with a practical purpose rather than a scientific one and kept
in general well within that purpose—giving brief information about writers not generally

<pb n="815"/>
known. This is perhaps why in writings of the better known writers like Cyprian he does
not enumerate their works.</p>
<p>2. The work of Gennadius was written about 430 according to some, or 492 to 495 according
to others. Ebert with the Benedictins and others before him, makes an almost con-
clusive argument in favor of the earlier date on the ground that Gennadius speaks of
Timotheus Aelurus who died in 477 as still living. This compels the rejection of the paragraph
on Gennadius himself as by a later hand but this should probably be done at any rate, on
other grounds. The mss. suggest that Gennadius ended with John of Antioch, although an
hypothesis of three editions before the year 500, of which perhaps two were by Gennadius,
has grounds. The bulk of the work at least was composed about 480 (probably chapters
1–90) and the remainder added perhaps within a few years by Gennadius or more probably
two other hands.</p>
<p>Gennadius style is as bare and more irregular than Jerome’s but he more frequently
expresses a critical judgment and gives more interesting glimpses of his own—the semi-
Pelagian—point of view. The work appears more original than Jerome’s and as a whole
hardly less valuable, though the period he covers is so much shorter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
<pb n="816"/>
<head>2. Literature.</head>
<p>1. The literature on Jerome is immense. The most often quoted general works are
Zöckler, Hieronymus. Gotha, 1865 and Thierry, St. Jérome Par. 1867. On Jerome in general
the article by Freemantle in Smith and Wace Dict. of Christian Biography is the first for the
English reader to turn to. Ceillier and other patrologies, while sufficiently full for their
purpose, give very little special treatment to this work, Ebert (Gesch. chr.-Lat.-Lit. Lpz. 1874)
being a partial exception to this statement. The best literary sources are the prolegomena
and notes to the various editions of the work itself. Much the same may be said of Gennadius
though the relative importance of his catalogue among his writings gives that a larger proportionate
attention. In English the article by Cazenove in Smith and Wace and in French
the account in the Histoire litteraire de la France are the best generally accessible references.</p>
<p>2. Literature on the writers mentioned by Jerome and Gennadius. Any one who cares to
follow up in English the study of any of the writers mentioned in the Lives of illustrious

<head>3. Manuscripts.</head>
<p>The manuscripts of Jerome and Gennadius are numerous. The translator has seen 84
mss. of Jerome and 57 of Gennadius and has certain memoranda of at least 25 more and
hints of still another score. It is certainly within bounds to say that there are more than 150
mss. of Jerome extant and not less than 100 of Gennadius.</p>
<p>The oldest of those examined (and all the oldest of which he could learn were seen) are
at Rome, Verona, Vercelli, Montpellier, Paris, Munich and Vienna.</p>

<head>4. Editions.</head>
<p>The editions of Jerome are relatively as numerous as the mss. The Illustrious men is in-
cluded in almost all the editions of his collected works, in his collected “minor writings”
and in many of the editions of his epistles (most of the editions in fact from 1468 to about
1530.)</p>
<p>It is several times printed separately or with Gennadius or other catalogues. The editions
of Gennadius are less numerous but he is often united with Jerome in the editions of Jerome’s
collected works, and generally in the separate editions.</p>
<p>The following list of editions is printed as illustrative. It does not pretend to be complete,
but is simply a list of such as have been personally examined by the translator up to date; s.

Helmst 1611–12 Cologne 1616; Frf. <del>1622</del>; Antw. 1639 Frf. 1684; Paris 1706 (Martianay U+0026
Pouget); Helmst. 1700; Hamb. 1718; Veron. 1734–42 (Vallarsi); repr. 1766–72; Florence
1791; Paris 1865 (Migne); Lpz. 1879 (Herding) Turin 1875, 1877, 1885 (Jerome only).</p>
<p>Andreas, Erasmus, Victorinus, Graevius, Martianay, Miraeus, Fabricius, Cyprian are
among the earlier editors but Erasmus is facile princeps in popularity of reprint. The edition
of Vallarsi in 1734–42 was a decided advance toward a critical text. Various editors before
him had made use of various mss. especially the “Corbeiensis” or “Sangermanensis” but
secondarily mss. at Wulfenbüttel, Munich, the Bodleian, Nürnberg, “Sigbergensis,” “Gemblacensis,”
“Marcianus” and others. Vallarsi founded his edition largely on a Verona ms.
(still there) on the “Corbeiensis” so much used and praised before (now Paris Lat. 12161
“St. Crucis” one at Lucca of the 9th century and more or less on mss. employed by previous
editors. This edition has remained the standard and is the one adopted for the Migne edition.</p>
<p>The most recent edition which pretends to a critical character is that of Herding (Lpz.
1879). The editions by Tamietti are simply school editions of Jerome only, and make no
pretensions to a critical text. The edition of Herding is founded on a transcript of Vat. Reg.
2077, 7th century; Bamberg 677, 11th century; Bern, 11 cent. and a much mutilated Nürnberg
ms. of the 14th century. But it appears that the transcript of Vaticanus only covered the
Jerome and a few scanty readings from Gennadius and the same is true of the collation made
for this editor later from the Paris ms. (Corbeiensis).</p>
<p>Sittl, (Jahresber; u. class. Alterthumsw. 1888. 2 p. 243) says that the edition “without
the preface which contains a collation of Codex Corbeiensis would be worthless.” This is a
little strong, for the readings he gives from Vaticanus have a decided value in default of

<pb n="819"/>
other sources for its readings and his strict following of this often produces a correct reading
against Vallarsi who was naturally inclined to follow Veronensis and Corbeiensis both of
which were probably a good deal manipulated after they left the hand of Gennadius. The
collation of Corbeiensis besides excluding Gennadius is not over exact and some of the most
effaced pages seem to have been given up entirely by the collator.</p>

<head>5. Translations.</head>
<p>An early translation of Jerome’s work into Greek was made by Sophronius and used by
Photius. A translation purporting to be his is given by Erasmus. There has been a good deal
of controversy over this, some even accusing Erasmus of having forged it entire. It is an
open question with a general tendency to give Erasmus the benefit of the doubt. The present
translator while holding his judgment ready to be corrected by the finding of a ms. or other
evidence, inclines to reject in toto, regarding it as for the most part translated by Erasmus
from some South German or Swiss ms., or, if that be not certain, at least that the translation
is too little established to be of any use for textual purposes. There is a modern translation
of select words of Jerome in French by Matougues. The chief sources for comparison used
by the translator have been Sophronius (or Erasmus) Matougues, M’Giffert’s Eusebius for
the first part of Jerome where he takes so liberally from Eusebius, and scattered selections
here and there in Ceillier, Smith and Wace, Dict. and other literary-historical works.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="821"/>
<head>6. The Present Translation.</head>
<p>1. Text. It was proposed at first to make the translation from the text of Herding. This,
and all editions, gave so little basis for scientific certainty in regard to various readings that
a cursory examination of mss. was made. At the suggestion of Professor O. von Gebhardt
of Berlin the examination was made as thorough and systematic as possible with definite
reference to a new edition. The translator hoped to finish and publish the new text before
the translation was needed for this series, but classification of the mss. proved unexpectedly
intricate and the question of the Greek translation so difficult that publication has been
delayed. The material has however been gathered, analyzed, sifted and arranged sufficiently
to give reasonable certainty as to the body of the work and a tolerably reliable judgment on
most of the important variations.</p>
<p>While anxious not to claim too much for his material and unwilling to give a final expression
of judgment on disputed readings, until his table of mss. is perfected, he ventures
to think that for substantial purposes of translation, if not for the nicer ones of a new text,
the material and method which he has made use of will be substantially conclusive.</p>
<p>The following translation has been made first from the text of Herding and then corrected
from the manuscripts in all places where the evidence was clearly against the edition. In
places where the evidence is fairly conclusive the change has been made and a brief statement
of evidence given in the notes. When the evidence is really doubtful the reading has been
allowed to stand with evidence generally given.</p>
<p>The materials of evidence used are 1. eight mss. collated entire by the translator A.
Parisinus (Corbeiensis or Sangermanensis 7 cent.) T. Vaticanus Reg., 7 cent.; 25 Veronensis,
8 cent.; 30 Vercellensis 8 cent.; 31 Monspessalanensis 8 or 9 cent.; a Monacensis 8 cent.; e
Vindobonensis 8 or 9; H. Parisinus 10 or 9.</p>
<p>2. Occasional support from readings gathered by him from other mss., chiefly 10 Cassenatensis
9 cent.; 21 Florentinus, 11 cent.; 32 Toletanus 13 cent.; 40 Guelferbyrtinus, 10?
cent.</p>
<p>3. Readings from mss. mentioned by other editors.</p>
<p>4. The various editions, but mainly confined to Vallarsi and Herding in Jerome, Fabricius
and Herding in Gennadius.</p>
<p>The translator has examined nearly 90 mss. and secured more or less readings from
nearly all with reference to an exact table. The readings of several are extensive enough to
have pretty nearly the value of full collations. Quotations are occasionally made from these
(e.g. from 10, 21, 29, 32, 40, etc.) but practically quotations from the eight mentioned mss.
cover the evidence and without a table more would rather obscure than otherwise.</p>
<p>There is no opportunity here to discuss the relative value of these used. It may be said
however that they are the oldest mss., and include pretty much all the oldest. Though age
itself is by no means conclusive, the fact that they certainly represent several independent

<pb n="822"/>
groups makes it safe to say that a consensus of seven against one or even six against any two
(with certain reservations) or in the case of Gennadius of 5 against 2 is conclusive for a
reading. As a matter of fact against many readings of Herding and even of Vallarsi, are arranged
all these mss., and against some nearly all or even every ms. seen, e.g. Her. p. 73 d.
12 reads morti dari with Migne-Fabricius but all these mss. have mutandam and so 91. 22
“seven” for “eight.” On p. 161. 7. Her. omits Asyncritus against mss. and all modern eds.,
so 44. 3. “Ponti,” 51. 7 “ut quidem putant;” 77. 25. “firmare” and a score of other places.</p>
<p>Of course this is not enough evidence or discussion for a critical scholastic text but for
the practical illustrative purpose in hand will serve. Any evidence which does not give a well
digested genealogy of mss. and the evidence for their classification must be reckoned as incomplete,—
all that the above evidence can claim to do, is to give the translator’s judgment
respecting the readings and illustrative evidence, but it is not probable that the completed
table will alter many (if any) of these readings which are given in view of a tentative table
which will likely prove final.</p>
<p>The Translation itself. The plan of this work includes (a) a translation, in which the
translator has tried to give a fair representation of the text in a not too ragged form but has
failed to improve on the original. The works were written as science rather than literature
and have many facts but no style. The translator has therefore aimed rather at representing
these facts than at producing a piece of polite literature. (b) Notes are subjoined including,
first the brief biographical data which every one wants first to orient himself by, secondly
textual notes, and thirdly, occasional explanatory notes.</p>

Lives of Illustrious Men.</head>
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>You have urged me, Dexter,2320 to follow the example of Tranquillus2321 in giving a
systematic account of ecclesiastical writers, and to do for our writers what he did for the illustrious
men of letters among the Gentiles, namely, to briefly set before you all those who
have published2322 any memorable writing on the Holy Scriptures, from the time of our
Lord’s passion until the fourteenth year of the Emperor Theodosius.2323 A similar work has
been done by Hermippus2324 the peripatetic, Antigonus Carystius,2325 the learned Satyrus,
2326 and most learned of all, Aristoxenus the Musician,2327 among the Greeks, and among
the Latins by Varro,2328 Santra,2329 Nepos,2330 Hyginus,2331 and by him through whose
example you seek to stimulate2332 us,—Tranquillus.</p>
<p>But their situation and mine is not the same, for they, opening the old histories and
chronicles could as if gathering from some great meadow, weave some2333 small crown at
least for their work. As for me, what shall I do, who, having no predecessor, have, as the

bius Pamphilus in the ten books of his Church History has been of the utmost assistance,
and the works of various among those of whom we are to write, often testify to the dates of
their authors. And so I pray the Lord Jesus,2334 that what your Cicero, who stood at the
summit of Roman eloquence, did not scorn to do, compiling in his Brutus, a catalogue of
Latin orators, this I too may accomplish in the enumeration of ecclesiastical writers, and
accomplish in a fashion worthy of the exhortation which you made. But if, perchance any
of those who are yet writing have been overlooked by me in this volume, they ought to
ascribe it to themselves, rather than to me, for among those whom I have not read, I could
not, in the first place, know those who concealed their own writings, and, in the second
place, what is perhaps well known to others, would be quite unknown to me in this out of
the way corner of the earth.2335 But surely when they are distinguished by their writings,
they will not very greatly grieve over any loss in our non-mention of them. Let Celsus,
Porphyry, and Julian learn, rabid as they are against Christ, let their followers, they who
think the church has had no philosophers or orators or men of learning, learn how many
and what sort of men founded, built and adorned it, and cease to accuse our faith of such
rustic simplicity, and recognize rather their own ignorance.</p>

<p>Simon Peter2337 the son of John, from the village of Bethsaida in the province of Galilee,
brother of Andrew the apostle, and himself chief of the apostles, after having been bishop
of the church of Antioch and having preached to the Dispersion2338—the believers in circumcision,
2339 in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia—pushed on to Rome in
the second year of Claudius to overthrow Simon Magus,2340 and held the sacerdotal chair
there for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of Nero. At his hands
he received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to the cross with his head towards the
ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the
same manner as his Lord. He wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of
which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be
by him. Then too the Gospel according to Mark, who was his disciple and interpreter, is
ascribed to him. On the other hand, the books, of which one is entitled his Acts, another
his Gospel, a third his Preaching, a fourth his Revelation, a fifth his “Judgment” are rejected
as apocryphal.2341</p>

<p>James,2343 who is called the brother of the Lord,2344 surnamed the Just, the son of Joseph
by another wife, as some think, but, as appears to me, the son of Mary sister of the mother
of our Lord of whom John makes mention in his book,2345 after our Lord’s passion at once
ordained by the apostles bishop of Jerusalem, wrote a single epistle, which is reckoned among
the seven Catholic Epistles and even this is claimed by some to have been published by some
one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority. Hegesippus
who lived near the apostolic age, in the fifth book of his Commentaries, writing of James,
says “After the apostles, James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of
the Church at Jerusalem. Many indeed are called James. This one was holy from his mother’s
womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed
himself with ointment or bathed. He alone had the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies,
since indeed he did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the temple and
prayed in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed to have acquired the
hardness of camels’ knees.” He says also many other things, too numerous to mention.
Josephus also in the 20th book of his Antiquities, and Clement in the 7th of his Outlines
mention that on the death of Festus who reigned over Judea, Albinus was sent by Nero as
his successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the high priest, the youthful son
of Ananus of the priestly class taking advantage of the state of anarchy, assembled a council
and publicly tried to force James to deny that Christ is the son of God. When he refused
Ananius ordered him to be stoned. Cast down from a pinnacle of the temple, his legs broken,
but still half alive, raising his hands to heaven he said, “Lord forgive them for they know
not what they do.” Then struck on the head by the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are
accustomed to wring out garments2346 with—he died. This same Josephus records the tradition
that this James was of so great sanctity and reputation among the people that the
downfall of Jerusalem was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the apostle
Paul writes to the Galatians that “No one else of the apostles did I see except James the
brother of the Lord,” and shortly after the event the Acts of the apostles bear witness to the
matter. The Gospel also which is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews,2347 and which
I have recently translated into Greek and Latin and which also Origen2348 often makes use

of, after the account of the resurrection of the Saviour says, “but the Lord, after he had given
his grave clothes to the servant of the priest, appeared to James (for James had sworn that
he would not eat bread from that hour in which he drank the cup of the Lord until he should
see him rising again from among those that sleep)” and again, a little later, it says “‘Bring a
table and bread,’ said the Lord.” And immediately it is added, “He brought bread and blessed
and brake and gave to James the Just and said to him, ‘my brother eat thy bread, for the son
of man is risen from among those that sleep.’” And so he ruled the church of Jerusalem
thirty years, that is until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the temple from
which he had been cast down. His tombstone with its inscription was well known until the
siege of Titus and the end of Hadrian’s reign. Some of our writers think he was buried in
Mount Olivet, but they are mistaken.</p>

<p>Matthew,2349 also called Levi, apostle and aforetimes publican, composed a gospel of
Christ at first published in Judea in Hebrew2350 for the sake of those of the circumcision
who believed, but this was afterwards translated into Greek though by what author is uncertain.
The Hebrew itself has been preserved until the present day in the library at Cæsarea
which Pamphilus so diligently gathered. I have also had the opportunity of having the volume
described to me by the Nazarenes2351 of Beroea,2352 a city of Syria, who use it. In this it is
to be noted that wherever the Evangelist, whether on his own account or in the person of
our Lord the Saviour quotes the testimony of the Old Testament he does not follow the authority
of the translators of the Septuagint but the Hebrew. Wherefore these two forms exist
“Out of Egypt have I called my son,” and “for he shall be called a Nazarene.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.</head>
<p>Paul,2355 formerly called Saul, an apostle outside the number of the twelve apostles, was
of the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Giscalis2356 in Judea. When this was taken by the
Romans he removed with his parents to Tarsus in Cilicia. Sent by them to Jerusalem to study
law he was educated by Gamaliel a most learned man whom Luke mentions. But after he
had been present at the death of the martyr Stephen and had received letters from the high
priest of the temple for the persecution of those who believed in Christ, he proceeded to
Damascus, where constrained to faith by a revelation, as it is written in the Acts of the
apostles, he was transformed from a persecutor into an elect vessel. As Sergius Paulus Proconsul
of Cyprus was the first to believe on his preaching, he took his name from him because
he had subdued him to faith in Christ, and having been joined by Barnabas, after traversing
many cities, he returned to Jerusalem and was ordained apostle to the Gentiles by Peter,
James and John. And because a full account of his life is given in the Acts of the Apostles, I
only say this, that the twenty-fifth year after our Lord’s passion, that is the second of Nero,
at the time when Festus Procurator of Judea succeeded Felix, he was sent bound to Rome,
and remaining for two years in free custody, disputed daily with the Jews concerning the
advent of Christ. It ought to be said that at the first defence, the power of Nero having not
yet been confirmed, nor his wickedness broken forth to such a degree as the histories relate
concerning him, Paul was dismissed by Nero, that the gospel of Christ might be preached
also in the West. As he himself writes in the second epistle to Timothy, at the time when he
was about to be put to death dictating his epistle as he did while in chains; “At my first defence
no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. But the Lord
stood by2357 me and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed
and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion”
2358—clearly indicating Nero as lion on account of his cruelty. And directly following
he says “The Lord delivered me from the mouth of the lion” and again shortly “The Lord
delivered me2359 from every evil work and saved me unto his heavenly kingdom,”2360 for
indeed he felt within himself that his martyrdom was near at hand, for in the same epistle

he announced “for I am already being offered and the time of my departure is at hand.”2361
He then, in the fourteenth year of Nero on the same day with Peter, was beheaded at Rome
for Christ’s sake and was buried in the Ostian way, the twenty-seventh year after our Lord’s
passion. He wrote nine epistles to seven churches: To the Romans one, To the Corinthians
two, To the Galatians one, To the Ephesians one, To the Philippians one, To the Colossians
one, To the Thessalonians two; and besides these to his disciples, To Timothy two, To Titus
one, To Philemon one. The epistle which is called the Epistle to the Hebrews is not considered
his, on account of its difference from the others in style and language, but it is reckoned,
either according to Tertullian to be the work of Barnabas, or according to others, to be by
Luke the Evangelist or Clement afterwards bishop of the church at Rome, who, they say,
arranged and adorned the ideas of Paul in his own language, though to be sure, since Paul
was writing to Hebrews and was in disrepute among them he may have omitted his name
from the salutation on this account. He being a Hebrew wrote Hebrew, that is his own
tongue and most fluently while the things which were eloquently written in Hebrew were
more eloquently turned into Greek2362 and this is the reason why it seems to differ from
other epistles of Paul. Some read one also to2363 the Laodiceans but it is rejected by everyone.</p>

<p>Luke2366 a physician of Antioch, as his writings indicate, was not unskilled in the Greek
language. An adherent of the apostle Paul, and companion of all his journeying, he wrote
a Gospel, concerning which the same Paul says, “We send with him a brother whose praise
in the gospel is among all the churches”2367 and to the Colossians “Luke the beloved physician
salutes you,”2368 and to Timothy “Luke only is with me.”2369 He also wrote another excellent
volume to which he prefixed the title Acts of the Apostles, a history which extends to the
second year of Paul’s sojourn at Rome, that is to the fourth2370 year of Nero, from which
we learn that the book was composed in that same city. Therefore the Acts of Paul and
Thecla2371and all the fable about the lion baptized by him we reckon among the apocryphal
writings,2372 for how is it possible that the inseparable companion of the apostle in his
other affairs, alone should have been ignorant of this thing. Moreover Tertullian who lived
near those times, mentions a certain presbyter in Asia, an adherent of the apostle Paul,2373
who was convicted by John of having been the author of the book, and who, confessing that
he did this for love of Paul, resigned his office of presbyter. Some suppose that whenever
Paul in his epistle says “according to my gospel” he means the book of Luke and that Luke
not only was taught the gospel history by the apostle Paul who was not with the Lord in the
flesh, but also by other apostles. This he too at the beginning of his work declares, saying
“Even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers
of the word.” So he wrote the gospel as he had heard it, but composed the Acts of the apostles
as he himself had seen. He was buried at Constantinople to which city, in the twentieth year
of Constantius, his bones together with the remains of Andrew the apostle were transferred.</p>

<p>Mark2374 the disciple and interpreter of Peter wrote a short gospel at the request of the
brethren at Rome embodying what he had heard Peter tell. When Peter had heard this, he
approved it and published it to the churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the
sixth book of his Hypotyposes and Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, record. Peter also mentions
this Mark in his first epistle, figuratively indicating Rome under the name of Babylon “She
who2375 is in Babylon elect together with you saluteth you2376 and so doth Mark my son.”
So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went to Egypt and first preaching
Christ at Alexandria he formed a church so admirable in doctrine and continence of living
that he constrained all followers of Christ to his example. Philo most learned of the Jews
seeing the first church at Alexandria still Jewish in a degree, wrote a book2377 on their
manner of life as something creditable to his nation telling how, as Luke says, the believers
had all things in common2378 at Jerusalem, so he recorded that he saw2379 was done at Alexandria,
under the learned Mark. He died in the eighth year of Nero and was buried at
Alexandria, Annianus succeeding him.2380</p>

<p>John,2381 the apostle whom Jesus most loved, the son of Zebedee and brother of James,
the apostle whom Herod, after our Lord’s passion, beheaded, most recently of all the evangelists
wrote a Gospel, at the request of the bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus and other
heretics and especially against the then growing dogma of the Ebionites, who assert that
Christ did not exist before Mary. On this account he was compelled to maintain His divine
nativity. But there is said to be yet another reason for this work, in that when he had read
Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he approved indeed the substance of the history and declared
that the things they said were true, but that they had given the history of only one year, the
one, that is, which follows the imprisonment of John and in which he was put to death. So
passing by this year the events of which had been set forth by these, he related the events of
the earlier period before John was shut up in prison, so that it might be manifest to those
who should diligently read the volumes of the four Evangelists. This also takes away the
discrepancy which there seems to be between John and the others. He wrote also one Epistle
which begins as follows “That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard,
that which we have seen with our eyes and our hands handled concerning the word of life”
which is esteemed of by all men who are interested in the church or in learning. The other
two of which the first is “The elder to the elect lady and her children” and the other “The
elder unto Gaius2382 the beloved whom I love in truth,” are said to be the work of John the
presbyter to the memory of whom another sepulchre is shown at Ephesus to the present
day, though some think that there are two memorials of this same John the evangelist. We
shall treat of this matter in its turn2383 when we come to Papias his disciple. In the fourteenth
year then after Nero2384 Domitian having raised a second persecution he was banished to
the island of Patmos, and wrote the Apocalypse, on which Justin Martyr and Irenæus afterwards
wrote commentaries. But Domitian having been put to death and his acts, on account
of his excessive cruelty, having been annulled by the senate, he returned to Ephesus under
Pertinax2385 and continuing there until the time of the emperor Trajan, founded and built
churches throughout all Asia, and, worn out by old age, died in the sixty-eighth year after
our Lord’s passion and was buried near the same city.</p>

<p>Philo2391 the Jew, an Alexandrian of the priestly class, is placed by us among the ecclesiastical
writers on the ground that, writing a book concerning the first church of Mark the
evangelist at Alexandria, he writes to our praise, declaring not only that they were there,
but also that they were in many provinces and calling their habitations monasteries. From
this2392 it appears that the church of those that believed in Christ at first, was such as now
the monks desire to imitate,2393 that is, such that nothing is the peculiar property of any
one of them, none of them rich, none poor, that patrimonies are divided among the needy,
that they have leisure for prayer and psalms, for doctrine also and ascetic practice, that they
were in fact as Luke declares believers were at first at Jerusalem. They say that under Caius2394
Caligula he ventured to Rome, whither he had been sent as legate of his nation, and that
when a second time he had come to Claudius, he spoke in the same city with the apostle
Peter and enjoyed his friendship, and for this reason also adorned the adherents of Mark,
Peter’s disciple at Alexandria, with his praises. There are distinguished and innumerable
works by this man: On the five books of Moses, one book Concerning the confusion of tongues,
one book On nature and invention, one book On the things which our senses desire and we
detest, one book On learning, one book On the heir of divine things, one book On the division
of equals and contraries, one book On the three virtues, one book On why in Scripture the
names of many persons are changed, two books On covenants, one book On the life of a wise
man, one book Concerning giants, five books That dreams are sent by God, five books of
Questions and answers on Exodus, four books On the tabernacle and the Decalogue, as well
as books On victims and promises or curses, On Providence, On the Jews, On the manner of
one’s life, On Alexander, and That dumb beasts have right reason, and That every fool should
be a slave, and On the lives of the Christians, of which we spoke above, that is, lives of
apostolic men, which also he entitled, On those who practice the divine life, because in truth
they contemplate divine things and ever pray to God, also under other categories, two On
agriculture, two On drunkenness. There are other monuments of his genius which have not
come to our hands. Concerning him there is a proverb among the Greeks “Either Plato
philonized, or Philo platonized,” that is, either Plato followed Philo, or Philo, Plato, so great
is the similarity of ideas and language.</p>

seven books On the captivity of the Jews, which were deposited in the public library and, on
account of his genius, was found worthy of a statue at Rome. He wrote also twenty books
of Antiquities, from the beginning of the world until the fourteenth year of Domitian Cæsar,
and two of Antiquities against Appion, the grammarian of Alexandria who, under Caligula,
sent as legate on the part of the Gentiles against Philo, wrote also a book containing a vituperation
of the Jewish nation. Another book of his entitled, On all ruling wisdom, in which
the martyr deaths of the Maccabeans are related is highly esteemed. In the eighth book of
his Antiquities he most openly acknowledges that Christ was slain by the Pharisees on account
of the greatness of his miracles, that John the Baptist was truly a prophet, and that Jerusalem
was destroyed because of the murder of James the apostle. He wrote also concerning the
Lord after this fashion: “In this same time was Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it be lawful to
call him man. For he was a worker of wonderful miracles, and a teacher of those who freely
receive the truth. He had very many adherents also, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles,
and was believed to be Christ, and when through the envy of our chief men Pilate had crucified
him, nevertheless those who had loved him at first continued to the end, for he appeared
to them the third day alive. Many things, both these and other wonderful things are
in the songs of the prophets who prophesied concerning him and the sect of Christians, so
named from Him, exists to the present day.”</p>

<p>Ignatius,2405 third bishop of the church of Antioch after Peter the apostle, condemned
to the wild beasts during the persecution of Trajan, was sent bound to Rome, and when he
had come on his voyage as far as Smyrna, where Polycarp the pupil of John was bishop, he
wrote one epistle To the Ephesians, another To the Magnesians, a third To the Trallians, a
fourth To the Romans, and going thence, he wrote To the Philadelphians and To the
Smyrneans and especially To Polycarp, commending to him the church at Antioch. In this
last2406 he bore witness to the Gospel which I have recently translated, in respect of the
person of Christ saying, “I indeed saw him in the flesh after the resurrection and I believe
that he is,” and when he came to Peter and those who were with Peter, he said to them
“Behold! touch me and see me how that I am not an incorporeal spirit” and straightway
they touched him and believed. Moreover it seems worth while inasmuch as we have made
mention of such a man and of the Epistle which he wrote to the Romans, to give a few
“quotations”2407: “From Syria even unto Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and by sea,
by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, that is to say soldiers who guard me
and who only become worse when they are well treated. Their wrong doing, however is my
schoolmaster, but I am not thereby justified. May I have joy of the beasts that are prepared
for me; and I pray that I may find them ready; I will even coax them to devour me quickly
that they may not treat me as they have some whom they have refused to touch through
fear. And if they are unwilling, I will compel them to devour me. Forgive me my children,
I know what is expedient for me. Now do I begin to be a disciple, and desire none of the
things visible that I may attain unto Jesus Christ. Let fire and cross and attacks of wild beasts,
let wrenching of bones, cutting apart of limbs, crushing of the whole body, tortures2408 of
the devil,—let all these come upon me if only I may attain unto the joy which is in Christ.”</p>
<p>When he had been condemned to the wild beasts and with zeal for martyrdom heard
the lions roaring, he said “I am the grain of Christ. I am ground by the teeth of the wild
beasts that I may be found the bread of the world.” He was put to death the eleventh year
of Trajan and the remains of his body lie in Antioch outside the Daphnitic gate in the
cemetery.</p>

<p>Polycarp2409 disciple of the apostle John and by him ordained bishop of Smyrna was
chief of all Asia, where he saw and had as teachers some of the apostles and of those who
had seen the Lord. He, on account of certain questions concerning the day of the Passover,
went to Rome in the time of the emperor Antoninus Pius while Anicetus ruled the church
in that city. There he led back to the faith many of the believers who had been deceived
through the persuasion of Marcion and Valentinus, and when Marcion met him by chance
and said “Do you know us” he replied, “I know the firstborn of the devil.” Afterwards during
the reign of Marcus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus in the fourth persecution
after Nero, in the presence of the proconsul holding court at Smyrna and all the people
crying out against him in the Amphitheater, he was burned. He wrote a very valuable Epistle
to the Philippians which is read to the present day in the meetings in Asia.</p>

<p>Papias,2410 the pupil of John, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia, wrote only five volumes,
which he entitled Exposition of the words of our Lord, in which, when he had asserted in his
preface that he did not follow various opinions but had the apostles for authority, he said
“I considered what Andrew and Peter said, what Philip, what Thomas, what James, what
John,2411 what Matthew or any one else among the disciples of our Lord, what also Aristion
and the elder John, disciples of the Lord had said, not so much that I have their books to
read, as that their living voice is heard until the present day in the authors themselves.” It
appears through this catalogue of names that the John who is placed among the disciples is
not the same as the elder John whom he places after Aristion in his enumeration. This we
say moreover because of the opinion mentioned above, where we record that it is declared
by many that the last two epistles of John are the work not of the apostle but of the presbyter.</p>
<p>He is said to have published a Second coming of Our Lord or Millennium. Irenæus and
Apollinaris and others who say that after the resurrection the Lord will reign in the flesh
with the saints, follow him. Tertullian also in his work On the hope of the faithful, Victorinus
of Petau and Lactantius follow this view.</p>

Hadrian passed the winter at Athens to witness the Eleusinian mysteries and was initiated
into almost all the sacred mysteries of Greece, those who hated the Christians took opportunity
without instructions from the Emperor to harass the believers. At this time he
presented to Hadrian a work composed in behalf of our religion, indispensable, full of sound
argument and faith and worthy of the apostolic teaching. In which, illustrating the antiquity
of his period, he says that he has seen many who, oppressed by various ills, were healed by
the Lord in Judea as well as some who had been raised from the dead.</p>

Moreover, arguing against idols, he wrote a history, showing from what error they had first

<p>Justin,2420 a philosopher, and wearing the garb of philosopher, a citizen of Neapolis, a
city of Palestine, and the son of Priscus Bacchius, laboured strenuously in behalf of the religion
of Christ, insomuch that he delivered to Antoninus Pius and his sons and the senate,
a work written Against the nations, and did not shun the ignominy of the cross. He addressed
another book also to the successors of this Antoninus, Marcus Antoninus Verus and Lucius
Aurelius Commodus. Another volume of his Against the nations, is also extant, where he
discusses the nature of demons, and a fourth against the nations which he entitled, Refutation
and yet another On the sovereignty of God, and another book which he entitled, Psaltes, and
another On the Soul, the Dialogue against the Jews, which he held against Trypho, the leader
of the Jews, and also notable volumes Against Marcion, which Irenæus also mentions in the

in the Apology which is addressed to Antoninus Pius. He, when he had held διατριβάς in

against the Christians, of gluttony and fear of death, and had proved him devoted to luxury
and lusts, at last, accused of being a Christian, through the efforts and wiles of Crescens, he

you diligently compare, after you have transcribed, and amend it according to the copy from
which you have transcribed it and also that you shall similarly transcribe this adjuration as

the fraternity, if indeed Victor believed that the many bishops of Asia and the East, who
with the Jews celebrated the passover, on the fourteenth day of the new moon, were to be

Prisca and Maximilla, “if they denied that they have accepted gifts, let them confess
that those who do accept are not prophets and I will prove by a thousand witnesses that
they have received gifts, for it is by other fruits that prophets are shown to be prophets indeed.
Tell me, does a prophet dye his hair? Does a prophet stain her eyelids with antimony? Is a
prophet adorned with fine garments and precious stones? Does a prophet play with dice
and tables? Does he accept usury? Let them respond whether this ought to be permitted or
not, it will be my task to prove that they do these things.” He says in the same book, that
the time when he wrote the work was the fortieth year after the beginning of the heresy of
the Cataphrygians. Tertullian added to the six volumes which he wrote On ecstasy against
the church a seventh, directed especially against Apollonius, in which he attempts to defend
all which Apollonius refuted. Apollonius flourished in the reigns of Commodus and Severus.</p>

“that you may know moreover that the madness of this false doctrine, that is the doctrine
of a new prophecy, is reprobated by all the world, I have sent to you the letters of the most
holy Apollinaris bishop of Hierapolis in Asia.” He wrote a volume also to Domnus, who in
time of persecution went over to the Jews, and another work on the gospel which passes
under the name of Peter, a work to the church of the Rhosenses in Cilicia who by the reading
of this book had turned aside to heresy. There are here and there short letters of his, harmonious
in character with the ascetic life of their author.</p>

<p>Polycrates2454 bishop of the Ephesians with other bishops of Asia who in accordance
with some ancient custom celebrated the passover with the Jews on the fourteenth of the
month, wrote a synodical letter against Victor bishop of Rome in which he says that he follows
the authority of the apostle John and of the ancients. From this we make the following brief
quotations, “We therefore celebrate the day according to usage, inviolably, neither adding
anything to nor taking anything from it, for in Asia lie the remains of the greatest saints of
those who shall rise again on the day of the Lord, when he shall come in majesty from
heaven and shall quicken all the saints, I mean Philip one of the twelve apostles who sleeps
at Hierapolis and his two daughters who were virgins until their death and another daughter
of his who died at Ephesus full of the Holy Spirit. And John too, who lay on Our Lord’s
breast and was his high priest carrying the golden frontlet on his forehead, both martyr and
doctor, fell asleep at Ephesus and Polycarp bishop and martyr died at Smyrna. Thraseas of
Eumenia also, bishop and martyr, rests in the same Smyrna. What need is there of mentioning
Sagaris, bishop and martyr, who sleeps in Laodicea and the blessed Papyrus and Melito,
eunuch in the Holy Spirit, who, ever serving the Lord, was laid to rest in Sardis and there
awaits his resurrection at Christ’s advent. These all observed the day of the passover on the
fourteenth of the month, in nowise departing from the evangelical tradition and following
the ecclesiastical canon. I also, Polycrates, the least of all your servants, according to the
doctrine of my relatives which I also have followed (for there were seven of my relatives
bishops indeed and I the eighth) have always celebrated the passover when the Jewish people
celebrated the putting away of the leaven. And so brethren being sixty-five years old in the
Lord and instructed by many brethren from all parts of the world, and having searched all
the Scriptures, I will not fear those who threaten us, for my predecessors said “It is fitting
to obey God rather than men.” I quote this to show through a small example the genius and
authority of the man. He flourished in the reign of the emperor Severus in the same period
as Narcissus of Jerusalem.</p>

reign of the emperor Severus and Antoninus Caracalla and wrote many volumes which we
pass by because they are well known to most. I myself have seen a certain Paul an old man
of Concordia, a town of Italy, who, while he himself was a very young man had been secretary
to the blessed Cyprian who was already advanced in age. He said that he himself had seen
how Cyprian was accustomed never to pass a day without reading Tertullian, and that he
frequently said to him, “Give me the master,” meaning by this, Tertullian. He was presbyter
of the church until middle life, afterwards driven by the envy and abuse of the clergy of the
Roman church, he lapsed to the doctrine of Montanus, and mentions the new prophecy in
many of his books.</p>
<p>He composed, moreover, directly against the church, volumes: On modesty, On persecution,
On fasts, On monogamy, six books On ecstasy, and a seventh which he wrote Against
Apollonius. He is said to have lived to a decrepit old age, and to have composed many small
works, which are not extant.</p>

<p>Origen,2463 surnamed Adamantius, a persecution having been raised against the
Christians in the tenth year of Severus Pertinax, and his father Leonidas having received
the crown of martyrdom for Christ, was left at the age of about seventeen, with his six
brothers and widowed mother, in poverty, for their property had been confiscated because
of confessing Christ. When only eighteen years old, he undertook the work of instructing
the Catechetes in the scattered churches of Alexandria. Afterwards appointed by Demetrius,
bishop of this city, successor to the presbyter Clement, he flourished many years. When he
had already reached middle life, on account of the churches of Achaia, which were torn with
many heresies, he was journeying to Athens, by way of Palestine, under the authority of an
ecclesiastical letter, and having been ordained presbyter by Theoctistus and Alexander,
bishops of Cæsarea and Jerusalem, he offended Demetrius, who was so wildly enraged at
him that he wrote everywhere to injure his reputation. It is known that before he went to
Cæsarea, he had been at Rome, under bishop Zephyrinus. Immediately on his return to
Alexandria he made Heraclas the presbyter, who continued to wear his philosopher’s garb,
his assistant in the school for catechetes. Heraclas became bishop of the church of Alexandria,
after Demetrius. How great the glory of Origen was, appears from the fact that Firmilianus,
bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained
him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he
came to Cæsarea2464 and was instructed at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears
also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor
Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour,
and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become
a christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant. Who is there, who does not also
know that he was so assiduous in the study of Holy Scriptures, that contrary to the spirit of
his time, and of his people, he learned the Hebrew language, and taking the Septuagint
translation, he gathered the other translations also in a single work, namely, that of Aquila,
of Ponticus the Proselyte, and Theodotian the Ebonite, and Symmachus an adherent of the
same sect who wrote commentaries also on the gospel according to Matthew, from which
he tried to establish his doctrine. And besides these, a fifth, sixth, and seventh translation,
which we also have from his library, he sought out with great diligence, and compared with
other editions. And since I have given a list of his works, in the volumes of letters which I
have written to Paula, in a letter which I wrote against the works of Varro, I pass this by
now, not failing however, to make mention of his immortal genius, how that he understood
dialectics, as well as geometry, arithmetic, music, grammar, and rhetoric, and taught all the

schools of philosophers, in such wise that he had also diligent students in secular literature,
and lectured to them daily, and the crowds which flocked to him were marvellous. These,
he received in the hope that through the instrumentality of this secular literature, he might
establish them in the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to speak of the cruelty of that persecution which was raised against
the Christians and under Decius, who was mad against the religion of Philip, whom he had
slain,—the persecution in which Fabianus, bishop of the Roman church, perished at Rome,
and Alexander and Babylas, Pontifs of the churches of Jerusalem and Antioch, were imprisoned
for their confession of Christ. If any one wishes to know what was done in regard
to the position of Origen, he can clearly learn, first indeed from his own epistles, which after
the persecution, were sent to different ones, and secondly, from the sixth book of the church
history of Eusebius of Cæsarea, and from his six volumes in behalf of the same Origen.</p>
<p>He lived until the time of Gallus and Volusianus, that is, until his sixty-ninth year, and
died at Tyre, in which city he also was buried.</p>

that he continued a Christian until the very end of his life.</p>

which the Greeks called ἐκκαιδεκαετηρίδα and gave the cue to Eusebius, who composed
on the same Paschal feast a cycle of nineteen years, that is ἐννεακαιδεκαετηρίδα. He wrote
some commentaries on the Scriptures, among which are the following: On the six days of
creation, On Exodus, On the Song of Songs, On Genesis, On Zechariah, On the Psalms, On
Isaiah, On Daniel, On the Apocalypse, On the Proverbs, On Ecclesiastes, On Saul, On the
Pythonissa, On the Antichrist, On the resurrection, Against Marcion, On the Passover, Against
all heresies, and an exhortation On the praise of our Lord and Saviour, in which he indicates
that he is speaking in the church in the presence of Origen. Ambrosius, who we have said
was converted by Origen from the heresy of Marcion, to the true faith, urged Origen to
write, in emulation of Hyppolytus, commentaries on the Scriptures, offering him seven, and
even more secretaries, and their expenses, and an equal number of copyists, and what is still
more, with incredible zeal, daily exacting work from him, on which account Origen, in one
of his epistles, calls him his “Taskmaster.”</p>

would enter the city, who should be assistant on the sacerdotal throne. And so it came to
pass, as it was predicted, and all the bishops of Palestine being gathered together, Narcissus
himself being especially urgent, Alexander took with him the helm of the church of Jerusalem.
At the end of one of his epistles, written to the Antinoites On the peace of the church, he says
“Narcissus, who held the bishopric here before me, and now with me exercises his office by
his prayers, being about a hundred and sixteen years old, salutes you, and with me begs you
to become of one mind.” He wrote another also To the Antiocheans, by the hand of Clement,

of Origen against Demetrius, called forth by the fact that, according to the testimony of Demetrius,
he had made Origen presbyter. There are other epistles of his to different persons.

Xystus, who had succeeded Stephen, two also To Philemon and Dionysius, presbyters of the
church at Rome, and another To the same Dionysius, afterwards bishop of Rome; and To
Novatian, treating of their claim that Novatian had been ordained bishop of Rome, against

greeting. If you have been ordained unwillingly, as you say, you will prove it, when you shall

<p>Novatianus,2488 presbyter of Rome, attempted to usurp the sacerdotal chair occupied
by Cornelius, and established the dogma of the Novatians, or as they are called in Greek,
the Cathari, by refusing to receive penitent apostates. Novatus, author of this doctrine, was
a presbyter of Cyprian. He wrote, On the passover, On the Sabbath, On circumcision, On the
priesthood, On prayer,2489On the food of the Jews, On zeal, On Attalus, and many others,
especially, a great volume On the Trinity, a sort of epitome of the work of Tertullian, which

<p>Didymus,2539 of Alexandria, becoming blind while very young, and therefore ignorant
of the rudiments of learning, displayed such a miracle of intelligence as to learn perfectly
dialectics and even geometry, sciences which especially require sight. He wrote many admirable
works: Commentaries on all the Psalms, Commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and
John, On the doctrines, also two books Against the Arians, and one book On the Holy Spirit,
which I translated in Latin, eighteen volumes On Isaiah, three books of commentaries On
Hosea, addressed to me, and five books On Zechariah, written at my request, also commentaries
On Job, and many other things, to give an account of which would be a work of itself.2540
He is still living, and has already passed his eighty-third year.</p>

On the death of his brother Cæsarius, On charity, In praise of the Maccabees, In praise of
Cyprian, In praise of Athanasius, In praise of Maximus the philosopher after he had returned
from exile. This latter however, some superscribe with the pseudonym of Herona, since
there is another work by Gregory, upbraiding this same Maximus, as if one might not praise
and upbraid the same person at one time or another as the occasion may demand. Other
works of his are a book in hexameter, containing, A discussion between virginity and marriage,
two books Against Eunomius, one book On the Holy Spirit, and one Against the Emperor
Julian. He was a follower of Polemon in his style of speaking. Having ordained his successor
in the bishopric, during his own life time, he retired to the country where he lived the life
of a monk and died, three years or more ago, in the reign of Theodosius.</p>

<p>James,2573 surnamed the Wise, was bishop of Nisibis the famous city of the Persians
and one of the confessors under Maximinus the persecutor. He was also one of those who,
in the Nicean council, by their opposition overthrew the Arian perversity of the Homoousia.
That the blessed Jerome mentions this man in his Chronicle as a man of great virtues and
yet does not place him in his catalogue of writers, will be easily explained if we note that of
the three or four Syrians whom he mentions he says that he read them translated into the
Greek. From this it is evident that, at that period, he did not know the Syriac language or
literature and therefore he did not know a writer who had not yet been translated into another
language. All his writings are contained in twenty-six books namely On faith, Against
all heresies, On charity towards all, On fasting, On prayer, On particular affection towards
our neighbor, On the resurrection, On the life after death, On humility, On penitence,2574 On
satisfaction, On virginity, On the worth2575 of the soul, On circumcision, On the blessed grapes,
On the saying in Isaiah, “the grape cluster shall not be destroyed,” That Christ is the son of
God and consubstantial with the Father, On chastity, Against the Nations, On the construction
of the tabernacle, On the conversation of the nations, On the Persian kingdom, On the persecution
of the Christians. He composed also a Chronicle of little interest indeed to the Greeks,
but of great reliability in that it is constructed only on the authority of the Divine Scriptures.
It shuts the mouths of those who, on some daring guess, idly philosophize concerning the
advent of Antichrist, or of our Lord. This man died in the time of Constantius and according
to the direction of his father Constantine was buried within the walls of Nisibis, for the
protection evidently of the city, and it turned out as Constantine had expected. For many
years after, Julian having entered Nisibis and grudging either the glory of him who was
buried there or the faith of Constantine, whose family he persecuted on account of this envy,
ordered the remains of the saint to be carried out of the city, and a few months later, as a
matter of public policy, the Emperor Jovian who succeeded Julian, gave over to the barbarians
the city which, with the adjoining territory, is subject unto the Persian rule until this
day.</p>

by incarnation there were two persons in Christ, so also there were two natures, but now
this too is regarded as injurious for it nourishes the Eutychian and Timothean heresies.</p>

<p>Paulonas,2577 the Presbyter, disciple of the blessed deacon Ephraim a man of very energetic
character and learned in the holy scriptures was distinguished among the doctors of
the church while his master was still living and especially as an extemporaneous orator.
After the death of his master, overcome by love of reputation, separating himself from the
church, he wrote many things opposed to the faith. The blessed Ephraim when on the point
of death is reported to have said to him as he stood by his side—See to it, Paulonas that you
do not yield yourself to your own ideas, but when you shall think that you understand God
wholly, believe that you have not known,—for he felt beforehand from the studies or the
words of Paulonus, that he was investigating new things, and was stretching out his mind
to the illimitable, whence also he frequently called him the new Bardesanes.</p>

desert, that is To the Abbot Cornelius one, To the Abbot Syrus one, and one To the heads of
all monasteries exhorting that, gathered together to one very ancient monastery which is
called in the Egyptian language Bau, they should celebrate the day of the Passover together
as by everlasting law. He urged likewise in another letter that on the day of remission, which
is celebrated in the month of August, the chief bishops should be gathered together to one

use to monks among which are these: Suggestions against the eight principal sins. He was
first to mention or among the first at least to teach these setting against them eight books
taken from the testimony of the Holy Scriptures only, after the example of our Lord, who
always met his tempter with quotations from Scripture, so that every suggestion, whether
of the devil or of depraved nature had a testimony against it. This work I have, under instructions,
translated into Latin translating with the same simplicity which I found in the Greek.
He composed also a book of One hundred sentiments for those living simply as anchorites,
arranged by chapters, and one of Fifty sentiments for the erudite and studious, which I first
translated into Latin. The former one, translated before, I restored, partly by retranslating
and partly by emendation, so as to represent the true meaning of the author, because I saw
that the translation was vitiated and confused by time. He composed also a doctrine of the
common-life suited to Cenobites and Synodites,2590 and to the virgin consecrated to God,
a little book suitable to her religion and sex. He published also a few collections of opinions
very obscure and, as he himself says of them, only to be understood by the hearts of monks,
and these likewise I published in Latin. He lived to old age, mighty in signs and miracles.</p>

<p>Theodorus,2591 presbyter of the church at Antioch, a cautious investigator and clever

fifteen books containing as many as fifteen thousand verses, in which he showed by the
clearest reasoning and by the testimony of Scripture that just as the Lord Jesus had a plenitude
of deity, so he had a plenitude of humanity. He taught also that man consists only of two
substances, soul and body and that sense and spirit are not different substances, but inherent
inborn faculties of the soul through which it is inspired and has rationality and through
which it makes the body capable of feeling. Moreover the fourteenth book of this work treats
wholly of the uncreated and alone incorporeal and ruling nature of the holy Trinity and of
the rationality of animals which he explains in a devotional spirit, on the authority of Holy
Scriptures. In the fifteenth volume he confirms and fortifies the whole body of his work by
citing the traditions of the fathers.</p>

the creation of the first man and his fall. He wrote also short books which are entitled in the
Greek, Apotheosis, Psychomachia and Hamartigenia, that is On divinity, On spiritual conflict,
On the origin of sin. He wrote also In praise of martyrs, an invitation to martyrdom in one
book citing several as examples and another of Hymns, but specially directed Against Symmachus2594

semi-versified language, Against the pagans, and because he was very little acquainted
with our literature he was better able to overthrow their <del>doctrine</del> than to establish ours.
Whence also, contending against them concerning the divine counterpromises, he discoursed
in a sufficiently wretched and so to speak, gross fashion, to their stupefaction and our despair.

with a certain presbyter named Marcellinus, he addressed to the emperors Valentinianus,
Theodosius and Arcadius, in defence of their fellow Christians. From this it appears that he
acquiesced in the Luciferian schism, in that in this same book he blames Hilary of Poitiers
and Damasus, bishop of Rome, for giving ill-advised counsel to the church, advising that
the apostate2598 bishops should be received into communion for the sake of restoring the
peace. For it was as displeasing to the Luciferians to receive the bishops who in the Ariminian

<p>Rufinus,2599 presbyter of the church at Aquileia, was not the least among the doctors
of the church and had a fine talent for elegant translation from Greek into Latin. In this way
he opened to the Latin speaking church the greater part of the Greek literature; translating
the works of Basil of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, Gregory Nazianzan, that most eloquent man,
the Recognitions of Clement of Rome, the Church history of Eusebius of Cæsarea in Palestine,
the Sentences of Xystus,2600 the Sentences of Evagrius and the work of Pamphilus Martyr
Against the mathematicians. Whatever among all these which are read by the Latins have
prefatory matter, have been translated by Rufinus, but those which are without Prologue
have been translated by some one else who did not choose to write a prologue. Not all of
Origen, however, is his work, for Jerome translated some which are identified by his prologue.
On his own account, the same Rufinus, ever through the grace of God published an Exposition
of the Apostles’ creed so excellent that other expositions are regarded as of no account in
comparison. He also wrote in a threefold sense, that is, the historical, moral and mystical
sense, on Jacob’s blessing on the patriarchs. He wrote also many epistles exhorting to fear
of God, among which those which he addressed to Proba are preëminent. He added also a
tenth and eleventh book to the ecclesiastical history which we have said was written by Eusebius
and translated by him. Moreover he responded to a detractor of his works, in two
volumes, arguing and proving that he exercised his talent with the aid of the Lord and in
the sight of God, for the good of the church, while he, on the other hand, incited by jealousy
had taken to polemics.</p>

<p>Tichonius,2601 an African by nationality was, it is said, sufficiently learned in sacred
literature, not wholly unacquainted with secular literature and zealous in ecclesiastical affairs.
He wrote books On internal war and Expositions of various causes in which for the defence
of his friends, he cites the ancient councils and from all of which2602 he is recognized to
have been a Donatist. He composed also eight Rules for investigating and ascertaining the
meaning of the Scriptures, compressing them into one volume. He also expounded the
Apocalypse of John entire, regarding nothing in it in a carnal sense, but all in a spiritual
sense. In this exposition he maintained the angelical nature2603 to be corporeal, moreover
he doubts that there will be a reign of the righteous on earth for a thousand years after the
resurrection, or that there will be two resurrections of the dead in the flesh, one of the
righteous and the other of the unrighteous, but maintains that there will be one simultaneous
resurrection of all, at which shall arise even the aborted and the deformed lest any living
human being, however deformed, should be lost. He makes such distinction to be sure,
between the two resurrections as to make the first, which he calls the apocalypse of the
righteous, only to take place in the growth of the church where, justified by faith, they are
raised from the dead bodies of their sins through baptism to the service of eternal life, but
the second, the general resurrection of all men in the flesh. This man flourished at the same
period with the above mentioned Rufinus during the reign of Theodosius and his sons.</p>

for signs and wonders and virtues.2605 He also wrote a Conference between Postumianus
and Gallus, in which he himself acted as mediator and judge of the debate. The subject
matter was the manner of life of the oriental monks and of St. Martin—a sort of dialogue
in two divisions. In the first of these he mentions a decree of the bishops at the synod of
Alexandria in his own time to the effect that Origen is to be read, though cautiously, by
those who are wise, for the good that is in him, and is to be rejected by the less able on account
of the evil. In his old age, he was led astray by the Pelagians, and recognizing the guilt of
much speaking, kept silent until his death, in order that by penitent silence he might atone
for the sin which he had contracted by speaking.</p>

reason and by testimony of the Scriptures, that the origin of the deity is one, that the Author
of his eternity and the Creator of the earth out of nothing, are one and the same, and likewise
concerning Christ, that he did not appear as man in a phantasm but had real flesh through
which eating, drinking, weary and weeping, suffering, dying, rising again he was demonstrated
to be man indeed. For Marcion and Valentinus had been opposed to these opinions asserting
that the origin of Deity is twofold and that Christ came in a phantasm. To Aëtius indeed
and Eunomius his disciple, he showed that the Father and Son are not of two natures and
equal in divinity but of one essence and the one from the other, that is the Son from the

zeal for religion but not according to knowledge, a book, polished neither in language nor

to his own perversity, as to venture to assert on their testimony that Joseph and Mary, after
the nativity of our Lord, had children who were called brothers of the Lord. In reply to his
perverseness Jerome, published a book against him, well filled with scripture proofs.2627</p>

<p>Theophilus,2628 bishop of the church2629 of Alexandria, wrote one great volume Against
Origen in which he condemns pretty nearly all his sayings and himself likewise, at the same
time saying that he was not original in his views but derived them from the ancient fathers
especially from Heraclas, that he was deposed from2630 the office of presbyter driven from
the church and compelled to fly from the city. He also wrote Against the Anthropomorphites,
heretics who say that God has the human form and members, confuting in a long discussion
and arguing by testimonies of Divine Scripture and convincing. He shows that, according
to the belief of the Fathers, God is to be thought of as incorporal, not formed with any suggestion
of members at all, and therefore there is nothing like Him among created things in
substance, nor has the incorruptibility nor unchangeableness nor incorporeality of his nature
been given to any one but that all intellectual natures are corporeal, all corruptible, all
mutable, that He alone should not be subject to corruptibility or changeableness, who alone
has immortality and life. Likewise the return of the paschal feast which the great council at
Nicea had found would take place after ninety years at the same time, the same month and
day adding some observations on the festival and explanations he gave to the emperor
Theodosius. I have read also three books On faith, which bear his name but, as their language
is not like his, I do not very much think they are by him.</p>

the manifold garment of the wisdom of God, he exhibited a church not having spot or
wrinkle or any such thing. In his work On the incarnation of the Lord also he manifested a

<p>Orosius,2640 a Spanish presbyter, a man most eloquent and learned in history, wrote
eight books against those enemies of the Christians who say that the decay of the Roman
State was caused by the Christian religion. In these rehearsing the calamities and miseries
and disturbances of wars, of pretty much the whole world from the creation2641 he shows
that the Roman Empire owed to the Christian religion its undeserved continuance and the
state of peace which it enjoyed for the worship of God.</p>
<p>In the first book he described the world situated within the ever flowing stream of
Oceanus and intersected by the Tanais, giving the situations of places, the names, number
and customs of nations, the characteristics of various regions, the wars begun and the
formation of empires sealed with the blood of kinsmen.</p>

<p>Petronius,2646 bishop of Bologna in Italy2647 a man of holy life and from his youth
practised in monastic studies, is reputed to have written the Lives of the Fathers, to wit of
the Egyptian monks, a work which the monks accept as the mirror and pattern of their
profession. I have read a treatise which bears his name On the ordination of bishops, a work
full of good reasoning and notable for its humility, but whose polished style shows it not to
have been his, but perhaps, as some say, the work of his father Petronius,2648 a man of great
eloquence and learned in secular literature. This I think is to be accepted, for the author of
the work describes himself as a prætorian prefect. He died in the reign of Theodosius and
Valentinianus.</p>

of Father, but that he should be called the Unbegotten or the Imperishable and the Absolute,
in order that whatever may be distinct from Him in person, may also be separate in nature,
showing that the Father, who is unchangeable in nature may be called the Unbegotten,
though the Scripture may not call Him so, that the person of the Son is begotten from Him,
not made, and that the person of the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him not begotten, and not
made. Under the name of this Syagrius I found seven books, entitled On Faith and the rules

with his heresy. He likewise teaches in this epistle and confirms by divine testimony that as
the Lord Jesus Christ is to be considered the true son of the Divine Father, so likewise he is
to be considered true man with human nature, that is, that he derived a body of flesh from
the flesh of the virgin and not as Eutyches asserted, that he showed a body from heaven.2695

by a single bishop in the place of him who had been put to death. And lest he, having been
illegally appointed, should be deservedly deposed at the will of the people who had hated
Proterius, he pronounced all the bishops of his vicinity to be Nestorians, and boldly presuming
to wash out the stain on his conscience by hardihood, wrote a very persuasive book to
the Emperor Leo, which he attempted to fortify by testimonies of the Fathers, used in a
perverted sense, so far as to show, for the sake of deceiving the emperor and establishing
his heresy, that Leo of Rome, pontiff of the city, and the synod of Chalcedon, and all the
Western bishops were fundamentally Nestorians. But by the grace of God, the enemy of the
church was refuted and overthrown at the Council of Chalcedon. He is said to be living in

man, not simply man born of a Virgin, to the Eutychians, that he had true human flesh,
taken on by God, and not merely a body made of thick air, or shown from Heaven; to the
Timotheans, that the Word was made flesh in such wise, that the Word remains Word in
substance, and, human nature remaining human nature, one person of the Son of God is

<p>Faustus,2724 first abbot of the monastery at Lerins, and then made bishop2725 of Riez

the church, composed a book On the Holy Spirit, in which he shows from the belief of the
fathers, that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial and coeternal with the Father and the Son, the
fulness of the Trinity and therefore God.2726 He published also an excellent work, On the
grace of God, through which we are saved,2727 in which he teaches that the grace of God always
invites, precedes and helps our will, and whatever gain that freedom of will may attain for
its pious effect, is not its own desert, but the gift of grace. I have read also a little book of his
Against the Arians and Macedonians, in which he posits a coëssential Trinity, and another
against those who say that there is anything incorporeal in created things, in which he
maintains from the testimony of Scriptures, and by quotations from the fathers, that nothing
is to be regarded as incorporeal but God. There is also a letter of his, written in the form of
a little book, and addressed to a certain deacon, named Graecus, who, leaving the Catholic
faith, had gone over to the Nestorian impiety.</p>
<p>In this epistle he admonishes him to believe that the holy Virgin Mary did not bring
forth a mere human being, who afterwards should receive divinity, but true God in true
man. There are still other works by him, but as I have not read, I do not care to mention
them. This excellent doctor is enthusiastically believed in and admired. He wrote afterwards
also to Felix, the Prætonian prefect, and a man of Patrician rank, son of Magnus the consul,
a very pious letter, exhorting to the fear of God, a work well fitted to induce one to repent
with his whole heart.</p>

as in reward so to speak to him for his abnegation and a compensation for his martyrdom.

<p>Theodulus,2735 2736 a presbyter in Coelesyria is said to have written many works, but
the only one which has come to my hand, is the one which he composed On the harmony
of divine Scripture, that is, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, against the ancient
heretics who on account of discrepancies in the injunctions of the ritual, say that the God
of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New. In this work he shows it to have
been by the dispensation of one and the same God, the author of both Scriptures, that one
law should be given by Moses to those of old in a ritual of sacrifices and in judicial laws, and
another to us through the presence of Christ in the holy mysteries and future promises, that
they should not be considered different, but as dictated by one spirit and one author, since
these things which if observed only according to the letter, would slay, if observed according
to the spirit, would give life to the mind. This writer died three years since2737 in the reign
of Zeno.</p>

<p>Pomerius2750 the Mauritanian was ordained presbyter in Gaul. He composed a dialectical
treatise in eight books On the nature of the soul and its properties, also one On the resurrection
and its particular bearing for the faithful in this life and in general for all men, written
in clear language and style, in the form of a dialogue between Julian the bishop, and Verus
the presbyter. The first book contains discourses on what the soul is and in what sense it is
thought to be created in the image of God, the second, whether the soul should be thought
of as corporeal or incorporeal, the third, how the soul of the first man2751 was made, fourth,
whether the soul which is put in the body at birth is newly created and without sin, or produced
from the substance of the first man like a shoot from a root it brings also with it the
original sin of the first man, fifth, a review of the fourth book of the discussion,2752 and an
inquiry as to what is the capability of the soul, that is its possibilities, and that it gains its
capability from a single and pure will, the sixth, whence arises the conflict between flesh
and the spirit, spoken of by the apostle, seventh, on the difference between the flesh and the
spirit in respect of life, of death and of resurrection, the eighth, answers to questions concerning
the things which it is predicted will happen at the end of the world, to such questions,
that is, as are usually propounded concerning the resurrection. I remember to have once
read a hortatory work of his, addressed to some one named Principius, On contempt of the
world, and of transitory things, and another entitled, On vices and virtues. He is said to have
written yet other works, which have not come to my knowledge, and to be still writing. He
is still living, and his life is worthy of Christian profession, and his rank in the church.</p>

<head>Prolegomena
on the
Life and Works of Rufinus.</head>
<p>Note.—The References (where a simple number is given) are to the pages in this Volume.</p>
<p>Tyrannius Rufinus is chiefly known from his relation to Jerome, first as an intimate
friend and afterwards as a bitter enemy. The immense influence of Jerome, through all the
ages in which criticism was asleep, has unduly lowered his adversary. But he has some solid
claims of his own on our recognition. His work on the Creed, besides its intrinsic merits,
must always be an authority as a witness to the state of the creed as held in the Italian
churches in the beginning of the 5th century, as also to the state of the Canon and the
Apocrypha at that time. And it is to his translations that we are indebted for our knowledge
of many of the works of Origen, including the greatest of them all, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. We are
the more grateful for his services because they were so opportune. The works of Origen,
which had been neglected in the West for a century and to such an extent that the Pope
Anastasius says (433) that he neither knows who he was nor what he wrote, came suddenly
into notice in the last quarter of a century before Alaric’s sack of Rome a.d. 385–410: and it
was at this moment that Rufinus appeared, according to his friend Macarius’ dream (439)
like a ship laden with the merchandize of the East, an Italian who had lived some 25 years
in Greek lands, and sufficiently equipped for the work of a translator. Through his labours
during the last 13 years of that eventful time a considerable part of the works of the great
Alexandrian have floated down across the ocean of the Dark Ages, and, while lost in their
native Greek, have in their Latin garb come to enrich the later civilization of the West.</p>
<p>a.d. 344–5: Rufinus was born at Concordia (Jer. Ep. v. 2. comp. with Ep. x. and De Vir.
Ill. §53) between Aquileia and Altinum, a place of some importance, which was destroyed
by the Huns in 452 but afterwards rebuilt. His birth was about the year 344 or 345, he being
slightly older than Jerome. Nothing is known of his education or the events of his youth;
but that he was early acquainted with Jerome and was interested in sacred literature is seen
from the fact that in 368 when Jerome went with Bonosus to Gaul, Rufinus begged him to
copy for him the works of Hilary on the Psalms and on the Councils of the Church (Jer. Ep.
v. 2).</p>
<p>a.d. 372–3: His mother did not die till the year 397, as is seen from Jerome’s mention
of her (Letter LXXXI, 1), and it would appear that both his parents were Christians. But he
was not baptized till about his 28th year. He was at that time living at Aquileia, where he

<pb n="1071"/>
had embraced the monastic state, and was a member of the company of young ascetics to
which Jerome and Bonosus belonged. The presence among them of Hylas (Jerome Letter
III, 3) the freedman of Melania, the wealthy and ascetic Roman matron, shows that that relation
had already begun which was afterwards of such importance in the life of Rufinus. It
must have been just before the breaking up of that company that he was baptized, for Jerome,
writing of him (Ep. iv. 2) in 374 from Antioch says “He has but lately been washed and is
as white as snow.” He himself gives a full account of his baptism in his Apology (436).</p>
<p>a.d. 373: When this company of friends was scattered, Rufinus joined the noble Roman
lady, Melania, in her pilgrimage to the East (Jer. Letter iv. 2). He visited the monasteries of
Egypt, and apparently desired to remain there; but a persecution arose against the orthodox
monks from Lucius the Arian bishop of Alexandria, seconded by the governor, both being
prompted by the Arian Emperor Valens: the monasteries were in many cases broken up
(Sozomen, vi, 19, Socrates iv, 21–3, Rufinus Eccl. Hist. ii, 3), and Rufinus himself for a while
suffered imprisonment and was then banished from Egypt (430 Eccl. Hist. ii, 4). Rufinus
probably on coming out of prison joined Melania who had then settled at Diocæsarea
(Pallad. Hist. Laus. §117) on the coast of Palestine for the purpose of making a home for
the Egyptian exiles on their way to their various destinations. He states in his Apology (466)
that he was 6 years in Egypt, and that he returned there again, after an interval, for two years
more. He was a pupil both of Didymus, then head of the catechetical school, who wrote for
him a treatise on the death of infants (534), and of Theophilus, afterward Bishop of Alexandria
(528), and that he saw many of the well-known hermits (466), such as Serapion and
Macarius, whom he describes in his History of the Monks. Whether Melania returned with
him to Egypt, or whether she went to Jerusalem, we do not know: it is also uncertain
whether a journey which he made (Eccl. Hist. ii. 8) to Edessa was undertaken at this time.
The date of the settlement of Melania on the Mount of Olives according to Jerome’s
Chronicle is 379, or, according to our present reckoning of dates, 377. We may suppose that
Rufinus joined her in 379. This was his home for eighteen years, till the year 397.</p>
<p>a.d. 386: Rufinus was ordained at Jerusalem, probably about the time when John, with
whom he was closely connected, succeeded Cyril in the Bishopric. The great resources of
Melania were added to his own which seem to have been not inconsiderable. He built habitations
for monks on the Mount of Olives, and employed them in learned pursuits, and in
copying manuscripts. On the arrival of Jerome at Bethlehem, the old friendship was renewed,
though not apparently with all its former warmth. Jerome certainly at times visited Rufinus
and once at least stayed with him (465), and he and his friends brought mss. to be copied
by the monks of the Mount of Olives (465). He gave lectures on Christian writers and doctrine,
of which a satirical account is given at a later period by Jerome2756 in his letter to
<note type="footnote">2756 “He came in with a slow and stately step; he spoke with a broken utterance, sometimes with a kind of
disjointed sobs rather than words. He had a pile of tomes upon the table; and then, with a frown and a contraction</note>

<pb n="1072"/>
Rusticus (cxxv, §18). The nick-name Grunnius which he there gives him was probably
caused by some trick of the voice. But we may gather from Jerome that he read the Greek
church writers diligently and lectured upon them, a study which enabled him to do much
good work at a later time. It is probable that he lectured in Greek, since he says in 397 that
his Latin was weak through disuse (439). We may set against Jerome’s depreciatory description
the account given by Palladius (Hist. Laus. §118). “Rufinus, who lived with Melania,
was a man of congenial spirit, and of great nobility and strength of character. No man has
ever been known of greater learning or of gentler disposition.” Palladius also speaks of the
princely hospitality of Melania and Rufinus: “They received,” he says, “bishops and monks,
virgins and matrons and helped them out of their own funds: They passed their life offending
none and being helpers of the whole world.” It is said by Palladius that he had heard from
Melania that she had been present at the death of Pambas in Egypt which took place in the
year 385, and it is probable that Rufinus accompanied her on this occasion. He himself records2757
a journey which he made to Edessa and Charrhoe, when he saw settlements of
the monks like those which he had previously seen in Egypt. But the date of this journey
does not appear. It may have been undertaken in order to visit some of the exiles from Egypt
before his establishment on the Mt. of Olives. He records also the visits of the remarkable
men who were entertained by him; Bacurius, who had been king of the Ubii, and afterwards
count of the Domestics under Theodosius, and was governor or duke of Palestine when
Rufinus settled there; and Ædesius the companion of Frumentius the Missionary to the
tribes in the N. W. of India. But his chief interest and occupation throughout seems to have
been with his monks at Mt. Olivet with perhaps some connection with the diocesan work
of his friend John, the Bp. of Jerusalem. Palladius records that Rufinus and Melania were
the means of restoring to the communion of the church 400 monks. What was this schism,
which Palladius describes as being “on account of Paulinus”? It is probable that the words
relate to the monks of Bethlehem whose alienation from the Church of Jerusalem had been
due to the ordination of Paulinian, Jerome’s brother, by Epiphanius. We know that Rufinus
before leaving Palestine was reconciled to Jerome (Jer. Ap. iii. 26, 33); and we know also
that Jerome’s book against John, Bishop of Jerusalem, which describes the schism was sud-
<note type="footnote">of the nostrils, and his forehead wrinkled up, he snapped his fingers to call the attention of his audience. What
he said had no depth in it; but he criticized others, and pointed out their defects, as though he would exclude
them from the Senate of Christian teachers. He was rich, and entertained freely, and many flocked round him
in his public appearances. He was as luxurious as Nero at home, as stern as Cato abroad; as full of contradictions
as the Chimæra.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2757 Hist. Eccl. ii. 8.</note>

<pb n="1073"/>
denly broken off;2758 and that he remained from that time forward at one with his Bishop.
We may be allowed to believe that the influence of Melania as well as Rufinus had been exerted
for some time previously to bring about this happy result.</p>
<p>a.d. 382: Rufinus’ part in the controversy thus terminated is partly known and partly
the subject of inference. The original source of discord is not known. It is possible that
Rufinus, who had been mentioned by Jerome in his Chronicle (a.d. 378) as being, together
with Florentius and Bonosus, a specially distinguished monk, did not find himself included
in his friend’s Catalogue of Church writers (De Vir. III.) published at Bethlehem.</p>
<p>a.d. 392: When Aterbius began the Origenist troubles at Jerusalem, Rufinus, who treated
him with merited scorn (Jer. Ap. iii, 33) probably felt some resentment at Jerome who, by
“giving satisfaction” to the heresy hunter, had countenanced his proceedings. Rufinus appears
as Bishop John’s adviser during the visit of Epiphanius (Jer. Letter li, 2, 6), as the chief of a
chorus of presbyters who applauded their own bishop and derided Epiphanius as a “silly
old man;”2759 and as present when Epiphanius remonstrated with his brother-bishop. He
is also mentioned by Epiphanius in his letter to John (Jer. Letter li. 6) as holding an important
place in the Church, “May God free you and all about you, especially the presbyter Rufinus,
from the heresy of Origen, and all others.” This sentence will suggest to all who are familiar
with church-controversies a whole series of scenes in the schism which continued between
Bethlehem and Jerusalem during the next five years. Jerome believed Rufinus to have injured
him at every turn, to have procured the abstraction of a Manuscript of his from the house
occupied by Fabiola on her visit to Bethlehem (Apol. iii, 4) perhaps to have been in league
with Vigilantius (Comp. Jer. Ep. lxi, 3 with Apol. iii, 4, 19). But such insinuations have the
appearance rather of the suspicions prompted by anger than of actual fact. In any case they
were condoned when the two old companions who had been so long parted by ecclesiastical
strife met together at the Church of the Resurrection at a solemn eucharistic feast, and joined
hands in token of reconciliation, and when Jerome accompanied his friend some way on
his journey before their final parting (Jer. Vol. iii, 24).</p>
<p>a.d. 397: He arrived in Italy, in company with Melania, early in the spring of 397. They
were there received by Paulinus of Nola with great honour.2760 Melania went on at once to
Rome; but Rufinus stopped at the monastery of Pinetum near Terracina. His welcome by
the Abbot Urseius and the philosopher Macarius, and their request to him to translate
various Greek books, amongst others the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν of Origen, are described in his Prefaces
<note type="footnote">2758 For the date of this work, see the Note prefixed to it in the translation of Jerome’s works, Vol. vi. of this

<pb n="1074"/>
to the Benedictions of the Patriarchs, the Apology of Pamphilus and the translations of
Origen (417, 418, 420, 439). The preface to Origen’s chief work (427) had the worst and
most lasting results. He says that, being aware of the odium attaching to the name of Origen,
he had feared to translate the work: but that the example of Jerome (whom he does not
name but whose great ability he extols) in translating Origen encourages him to follow in
his steps. This Preface, with this translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, was published in Rome
early in the year 398, Rufinus having moved there to stay with Melania.</p>
<p>a.d. 400–403: At Rome he lived in the circle of Melania, her son Publicola and his wife
Albina, with their daughter the younger Melania and her husband Pinianus, to whom we
may probably add the Pope Siricius, and certainly Apronianus, a young noble whom he
speaks of as his son in the faith (435, 564). Jerome’s friend Eusebius of Cremona was also
in Rome, and on friendly terms with him (445). But on the appearance of the work of Origen
with Rufinus’ Preface, a great ferment arose leading to the violent controversy between
Rufinus and Jerome which is described in the Preface to their Apologies (434, 482).</p>
<p>a.d. 398: Meanwhile, Rufinus had left Rome probably in 398, having obtained the usual
Literæ Formatæ from the Pope Siricius, who died that year, to introduce him to other
churches.2761 We hear of him at Milan, where in the presence of the Bishop, Simplicianus,2762
he met Eusebius of Cremona, and heard him read out a letter of Theophilus containing
some passages from the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, against which he vehemently protested (490).</p>
<p>a.d. 399–408: He then, having probably visited his native city of Concordia, where his
mother,2763 possibly his father also (430, 502) was still living, took up his abode at Aquileia.
There he was welcomed by the bishop, Chromatius, by whom he had been baptized some
26 or 27 years before. Rufinus probably arrived at Aquileia in the beginning of 399, and re-
mained there 9 or 10 years. It was during this period that all his principal works except the
Commentary on the Benedictions of the patriarchs, the translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν and
Pamphilus’ Apology, and the book on adulterations of Origen were composed. It was soon
after his settlement at Aquileia that he heard from Apronianus of the letter of Jerome to
Pammachius and Oceanus2764 expressing his anger against him for the mention he had
made of Jerome in the Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. The conciliatory letter to Rufinus which
accompanied this and which was an answer to a friendly one from Rufinus2765 was not sent
on by Jerome’s friends (489); and Rufinus, thinking that his old friend had completely turned
against him, composed his Apology (434–482) which drew forth Jerome’s reply (482–541).

<pb n="1075"/>
This controversy is placed in full before the reader of this volume in an English translation,
with prefatory notes. It may therefore be treated very shortly here.</p>
<p>Rufinus’ Apology is an answer to Jerome’s letter to Pammachius and Oceanus. It is addressed
to Apronianus of Rome. He makes a profession of his Christian standing and faith,
especially on the points raised by the Origenistic controversy; he describes the circumstances
which had led him to translate the books of Origen, and defends his method of translation,
which, he says, has been misrepresented by men sent from the East to lay snares for him.
His method, he declares, was the same which had been used by Jerome, who boasted that
through him the Latins knew all that was good in Origen and nothing of the bad. Where he
found passages in Origen’s writings, in flagrant contradiction to the orthodox opinion he
had maintained elsewhere, he concluded that the passage had been falsified by heretics, and
restored the more orthodox statement which he believed to have been originally there. He
then turns round upon Jerome and points out that, in his Commentaries on the Ephesians,
written some 10 years before, to which he specially referred in his Letter as showing his
freedom from heresy, he had practically adopted the opinions now imputed to Origen as
heretical, such as the fall of souls from a previous state into the prison house of earthly
bodies, and the universal restoration of spiritual beings.</p>
<p>In the second book he clears himself from the imputation of following Origen and Plato
in believing in the lawfulness of using occasional falsehood in the government and training
of men. But he imputes to his adversary a systematic use of falsehood in reference to his
reading heathen authors, while he professed in his letter to Eustochium (Jer. Ep. xxii) to
have solemnly promised never even to possess them. He then takes a wider view of Jerome’s
writings, showing how, in this Letter to Eustochium, his books against Jovinian, etc., he had
by his satirical pictures held up to ridicule the various classes of Christians, clergy, monks,
virgins: how he had praised Origen indiscriminately as a teacher second only to the Apostles:
how he had defamed men like Ambrose, and therefore his present accusations were little
worth: how he boasted of having taken as his teachers not only Origenists like Didymus or
heretics like Apollinarius, but heathen like Porphyry, and had made his translation of the
Old Testament under the influence of the Jew Baranina (whose name Rufinus perverts into
Barabbas). He concludes by summarizing his accusations and calling upon the reader to
choose between him and his opponent.</p>
<p>This Apology was only sent to a few friends of Rufinus (530); but portions of it became
known to Jerome’s friends and his brother Paulinian (493) carried them to Bethlehem, together
with Rufinus’ Apology addressed to Pope Anastasius. Jerome had also before him
the letter of Anastasius to John Bishop of Jerusalem (509) showing his dislike of Rufinus’
proceedings. On these he grounds his own Apology, which was originally in two books and
was addressed to Pammachius and Marcella a.d. 402.</p>

<pb n="1076"/>
<p>In the first book he blames Rufinus’ breach of friendship after the reconciliation which
had taken place at Jerusalem; he then shows that he was compelled to translate the Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν in order to show what it really was. He declares that the Apology of Origen translated
by Rufinus as the work of Pamphilus was really written by Eusebius; that Origen had been
condemned by Theophilus and Anastasius, by East and West alike, and by the decree of the
Emperors. He defends himself for having used heathen and heretical teachers, and help of
a Jewish scholar in translating the Old Testament. As to his Commentaries on the Ephesians
he declares that he merely put side by side the opinions of various commentators, indicating
at times his knowledge that some were heretical: and as to his anti-Ciceronian dream, he
ridicules the idea that a man can be bound by his night visions.</p>
<p>In the second book he criticizes Rufinus’ Apology addressed to Anastasius as to both
its style and its matter, and blames him for his treatment of Epiphanius, and endeavours to
implicate him in the imputation of heresy. He then defends his translation of the Old Testament,
showing by copious quotations from the Prefaces to the Books that he had done
nothing condemnatory of the Septuagint, whose version he had himself translated into
Latin and constantly used in familiar expositions.</p>
<p>This Apology was brought to Rufinus at Aquileia by a merchant who was leaving again
in two days (522). Chromatius no doubt urged him, as he urged Jerome (520) not to continue
the controversy and he yielded. He wrote, however, a private letter to Jerome, which has
been lost, sending him an accurate copy of his Apology, and while declining public controversy,
yet declaring that he could have said even more than before, and divulged things
which would have been worse to Jerome than death. Jerome in his answer written a.d. 403,
which forms B. iii of his Apology, declares that the controversy is Rufinus’ fault, and defends
his friends for their conduct towards him, even in holding back the conciliatory letter written
in 399; but shows how a way might still be open for friendship. He touches again upon most
of the points dwelt on in the previous books, defending himself and accusing Rufinus, and
ends by declaring that his bitter reply was necessitated first by Rufinus’ threats, and secondly
by his abhorrence of heresy, from all complicity with which he must at any price clear
himself.</p>
<p>This book closed the controversy. Rufinus did not reply, Jerome did not relent. Nothing
in Rufinus’ subsequent writings reflects on Jerome; but Jerome is never weary of expressing
his hatred of Rufinus, speaking of him after his death as “the Scorpion”2766 and writing
malignant satirical descriptions of him like that in his letter to Rusticus.2767</p>
<p>It may be observed, however, that notwithstanding the violent words used on both sides,
it was possible for eminent churchmen to esteem and befriend both parties. Augustine, on
<note type="footnote">2766 Jer. Ep. cxxvii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">2767 Jer. Ep. cxxv.</note>

<pb n="1077"/>
receiving Jerome’s Apology, laments, in words which must have been felt by Jerome as a
severe reproach, that two such men, so loved by the churches, should thus tear each other
to pieces. Chromatius, while he kept up communications with Jerome, and supplied him
with funds for his literary work, was also the friend and adviser of Rufinus.</p>
<p>Rufinus’ friends at Aquileia, like those at the Pinetum and at Rome, were anxious to
gain from him a knowledge of the great church-writers of the East, and especially of Origen.
No one at Aquileia seems to have known Greek. He makes excuses in his Prefaces (430, 563,
565, etc.) for the difficulty of the task and his own short-comings which seem to be partly
conventional, partly genuine. But he did a work which he alone or almost alone at that
period was qualified to do. His translations of Origen and Pamphilus were already known.
We learn from Jerome (536) that Rufinus had translated parts of the LXX. He now translated
Eusebius’ Church History, and added to it two books of his own; he translated the so-called
Recognitions of Clement, which till then were almost unknown in Italy. He wrote a History
of the Monks of the East, partly from personal knowledge, partly from what he had heard
or read of them. And he translated the Commentaries of Origen upon the Heptateuch or
1st seven books of Scripture, except Numbers and Deuteronomy; and those on the Epistle
to the Romans. He also wrote his exposition of the Creed (541–563), and probably some
other works which have not come down to us.</p>
<p>a.d. 400–402: The first part of his stay at Aquileia was troubled by the controversy with
Jerome. He also received from his friends at Rome the intelligence that his Preface and
translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν had been brought to the notice of the Pope Anastasius, by
Pammachius and Marcella (430); and probably the letter of the Pope to Venerius Bishop of
Milan, which is quoted in Anastasius’ letter to John of Jerusalem (433) was also brought to
his knowledge.</p>
<p>a.d. 400: Though there is no reason to suppose, as has been often done, that the Pope
passed sentence upon him, still less that he summoned him to Rome. Rufinus was so far
affected by what he heard of the adverse feeling excited in the Pope’s mind toward him that
he thought it desirable to write an explanation or apology (430–2) vindicating his action in
the translation of Origen, and giving an exposition of his own belief on some of the principal
points dealt with in the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. From the letter of Anastasius to John of Jerusalem we
gather that John had written to him in the interest of Rufinus, and had blamed Jerome’s
friends at Rome, perhaps also Jerome himself, for the part they had taken in reference to
him. It is a curious fact that this letter was known to Jerome but not to Rufinus during the
controversy (509); but it can hardly be inferred with any certainty from this that John had
changed sides and favoured Jerome at Rufinus’ expense.</p>
<p>a.d. 408: After 8 or 9 years at Aquileia Rufinus returned to Rome. His friend Chromatius
of Aquileia had died in 405. Anastasius of Rome had also passed away (a.d. 402), and his
successor Innocentius was without prejudice against Rufinus. Melania was either there or

<pb n="1078"/>
with Paulinus at Nola. Her son Publicola had died in 406, but his widow Albina was with
her, and her granddaughter the younger Melania with her husband Pinianus. The siege of
Rome by Alaric was impending, and the whole party were starting by way of Sicily and
Africa, in both of which Melania had property, intending eventually to reach Palestine. He
joined their “religious company” as he tells us in the Preface to Origen on Numbers (568)
which, according to Palladius (Hist. Laus. 119) formed a vast caravan with slaves, virgins
and eunuchs; and he was with them in Sicily when Alaric burned Rhegium (568) the flames
of which they saw across the straits.</p>
<p>This translation of Numbers was his last work. He was at that time suffering in his eyes;
and he died soon afterwards in Sicily, as we learn from Jerome’s malicious words “The
Scorpion now lies underground between Enceladus and Porphyrion.”2768 The undying
hatred of Jerome towards him has unduly lowered him in the estimation of the Church. He
was far below Jerome in literary ability, but in their great controversy he displayed more
magnanimity than his rival, being willing to forego a public answer to his provoking apology.
He was highly esteemed by the eminent churchmen of his time and the Bishops near whom
he lived. Chromatius of Aquileia was his friend; for Petronius of Bologna he wrote his
monastic history, for Gaudentius of Brixia he translated the Clementine Recognitions, for
Laurentius (perhaps of his native Concordia) he composed his work on the Creed. Paulinus
of Nola continued his friendship for him to the end. Above all Augustine speaks of him as
the object of love and of honour; and, in his reply to Jerome2769 who had sent him his
Apology, says: “I grieved, when I had read your book, that such discord should have arisen
between persons so dear and so intimate, bound to all the churches by a bond of affection
and of renown.”</p>
<p>We may conclude this notice by two quotations from writers who lived shortly after
the death of Rufinus; the first of which shows how unfairly the fame of Jerome has pressed
on the memory of his antagonist, while the second may be taken as the verdict of unprejudiced
history. Pope Gelasius, at a Council at Rome in 494, drew up a list of books to be received
in the church, in which he says of Rufinus: “He was a religious man, and wrote many
books of use to the Church, and many commentaries on the Scripture; but, since the most
blessed Jerome infamed him on certain points, we take part with him (Jerome) in this and
in all cases in which he has pronounced a condemnation.” (Migne’s Patrologia vol. lix. col.
175). On the other hand Gennadius, in his list of Ecclesiastical writers (c. 17) says: “Rufinus,
the presbyter, of Aquileia, was not the least of the church-teachers, and showed an elegant
genius in his translations from Greek into Latin;” and, after giving a list of his writings, he
continues: “He also replied in two volumes to him who decried his works, showing convin-

cingly that he had exercised his powers through the might which God had given him, and
for the good of the church, and that it was through a spirit of rivalry that his adversary had
employed his pen in defaming him.”</p>

<head>Works of Rufinus.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>I. Original Works which still Survive.</head>
<p>1. A Commentary on the Benedictions of the 12 Patriarchs. This short work was composed
at the monastery of Pinetum near Terracina during Lent in the year 398, at the request of
Paulinus of Nola. Rufinus had stayed with Paulinus on his first arrival with Melania in Italy
(Paulinus. Ep. xxix, 12.) and Paulinus wrote to him (417) after he had gone to Pinetum
begging him to give an explanation of the blessing of Jacob in Judah. Rufinus, though not
replying for a time, sent his exposition, and afterwards, on a second request from Paulinus,
added the exposition of the rest of the blessings in the Patriarchs, like the son in the parable
(as he explains in a graceful letter prefixed to the work) who said “I go not,” but afterwards
repented and went.</p>
<p>The exposition is well written and clear; but it is not in itself of much value. The text
on which he comments is very faulty: for instance, in the Blessing of Reuben, instead of the
words “the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power,” it has “durus conversatione,
et durus, temerarius.” When Rufinus adheres to the plain interpretation of the passage his
comments are sensible and clear; but he soon passes to the mystic sense: Reuben is God’s
first-born people, the Jews, and the couch which he defiles is the law of the Old Testament;
and the moral interpretation is grounded on the supposed meaning of Reuben, “the Son
who is seen,” that is the visible, carnal man, who breaks through the law. So, in Judah’s
“binding his foal to the vine,” the explanation given as he says, by the Jews, that the vines
will be so plentiful that they are used even for tying up the young colts, is dismissed. The
foal is the Christian Church the offspring of Israel which is God’s ass, and is bound to Christ
the true vine.</p>
<p>2. A dissertation on the adulteration of the works of Origen by heretics, subjoined to his
translation of Pamphilus’ Apology for Origen. This will be found in the present volume pp.
421–427.</p>
<p>3. An apology addressed to the Pope Anastasius. See the introductory note prefixed to
the translation of this work (429) now first translated into English.</p>
<p>4. The Apology for himself against the attacks of Jerome. See the introductory statement
prefixed to the translation (434–5).</p>
<p>5. Ecclesiastical History in Two Books, being a continuation of the History of Eusebius
translated by Rufinus into Latin. This work was composed at Aquileia at the request of the
Bishop, Chromatius. The date is probably 401, since in the Preface Rufinus says that he had
been requested to translate Eusebius at the time when Alaric was invading Italy. This must
allude to the first of Alaric’s invasions, in 400, since the second invasion (402) would have
been marked by some word such as “Iterum,” and at the 3d in 408 Chromatius had already
died. The history does not attempt to give more than the chief events, and these are told

<pb n="1081"/>
with little sense of proportion, the Council of Ariminum occupying about 20 lines, while
the story of the right arm of Arsenius which Athanasius was accused of cutting off takes up
five times that space. Some documents of great importance, however, are given, such as the
canons of Nicæa, and the Creed as it issued from the council. But there is much credulity,
as shown in the account of the Discovery of the True Cross by Helena mother of Constantine,
and the stories of the death of Arius and the attempted rebuilding of the Jewish Temple
under Julian. Rufinus has none of the critical power needed for a true historian. We may
add that all that is valuable in his history is incorporated into the works of Socrates (translated
in Vol. iii. of this Series). See especially B. ii, c. 1.</p>
<p>6. The History of the Monks which is a description of the Egyptian Solitaries appears to
have no mark of its date: But it was, no doubt, composed at Aquileia between 398 and 409,
probably in the later part of that period. It was written in the name of Petronius Bishop of
Bologna, and records his experiences, which he says he had been often requested by the
monks of Mt. Olivet to commit to writing. It is full of strange stories like those in Jerome’s
Lives of the Hermits Hilarion and Malchus.2770 There is often a verbal resemblance between
this book and the Lausiac History of Palladius; indeed, they at times record the same adventures
(compare the story of the crocodiles, Ruf. Hist. Mon. xxxiii. 6 with Pall. Hist. Laus. cl.,
where even the same prayers and texts are put into the mouths of the two narrators.) But it
is probable that in these cases Palladius is indebted to Rufinus.</p>
<p>7. The Exposition of the Creed is described in the note prefixed to the Translation (541).</p>
<p>8. The Prefaces to the Books of Origen, translated by Rufinus, and to the Apology of
Pamphilus for Origen, together with the Book on the Adulteration of Origen’s Writings are
given in this volume (420–427). That to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν (427) is the document on which
the great controversy between Jerome and Rufinus turns. That to Numbers gives personal
details of importance, while the Peroration to the Ep. to the Romans exhibits the method
used in translating. The Preface and Epilogue to the work of Pamphilus are of great importance
in connexion with the controversy between Jerome and Rufinus.</p>

<head>II. Translations from Greek Writers.</head>
<p>1. The Rule of St. Basil, translated at Pinetum for the Abbat Urseius in 397 or 398. This
was the first work written by Rufinus of which we have any knowledge.</p>
<p>2. The Apology of Pamphilus for Origen. This formed the 1st book of an Apology for
Origen’s teaching in 6 books, which were composed by Eusebius and Pamphilus during the
latter’s imprisonment at Cæsarea previous to his martyrdom. Eusebius speaks of this work
in a general way (H. E. vi. 33) as written by himself and Pamphilus. The last book, however,
was written by Eusebius alone after the death of Pamphilus. The part translated by Rufinus
is only the 1st book, and this he believed to be by Pamphilus alone. Jerome in his Apology
(487, 514) asserted that the whole was by Eusebius alone. But his bitter feeling led him astray
in this. The Apology for Origen has perished with the exception of this 1st book which
survives in Rufinus’ Translation. The Preface which he prefixed to the work, and the Epilogue
which he subjoined to it under the name of “The book concerning the adulteration of the
works of Origen” are given in our translation (420–427). This work was written at Pinetum
near Terracina at the request of Macarius, to whom the Preface is addressed, in the end of
397 or the beginning of 398. For the questions relating to the authorship of the Apology the
reader is referred to the Apologies of Jerome and Rufinus (esp. pp. 487, 514), to Lightfoot’s
Article on Eusebius in the Dict. of Eccl. Biography, and the Prolegomena to the Translation
of Eusebius in this Series, p. 36.</p>
<p>3. Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. This translation was also made at the request of Macarius, and
was finished as the Preface to B. iii. shows in the Lent of 398. The questions raised by this
Translation are discussed in the Introductions to the Works of Jerome (Vol. vi of this Series),
and of Rufinus in this Volume; and the controversy itself is developed in their Apologies
(434–540). The greater part of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν is known to us only through this translation.</p>
<p>4. Origen’s Homilies. Those on the Books of Moses and of Joshua were translated at
various times during the last 10 years of Rufinus’ life. He had intended, as he states in his
Preface to the Book of Numbers, to translate all that had been written by Origen on the
Pentateuch: he accomplished this as regards the first three books, and also as to the book
of Joshua, at the request of Chromatius; the book of Numbers he only finished in Sicily, just
before his death; and the Commentaries on Deuteronomy he did not live to translate. In
these translations, as he tells us (567), he did not scruple to supply what he found to be
omitted in the Greek, the Homilies being of a hortatory kind, whereas Rufinus’ object was
an exposition of the text.</p>
<p>The Translation of the Homilies on Judges, though there is no Preface to it, is ascribed
to Rufinus by Fontanini, who maintains that in this case, the name of Rufinus being discredited
on account of Jerome’s diatribe against him, the editors have suppressed the Preface,
while in some other cases they have substituted the name of Jerome for that of Rufinus.</p>

<pb n="1083"/>
<p>The Translation of Origen’s Commentary 36th, 37th and 38th Psalms is unquestionably
by Rufinus; it is dedicated to Apronianus, and may have been written in Rome (Fontanini
col. 188, beginning of ch. viii). The Preface is given by us in this volume. Fontanini also
gives to Rufinus a Translation of Origen’s Homilies on I Kings and on Canticles. The books
on Joshua and Judges he translated as he found them (567), but in the next he adopted a
different method.</p>
<p>The works of Origen on the Ep. to the Romans were very long, and Rufinus did not
scruple to condense them (reducing the 25 books of Origen to 10), as he clearly states in his
Peroration (567). This work he addressed to Heraclius, and it was composed during his stay
at Aquileia.</p>
<p>Rufinus had hoped, as we learn from the same Peroration (567), to translate some at
least of the Commentaries of Origen upon the other Epistles of St. Paul; but he first determined
to finish those upon the Pentateuch, a task in which, as we have seen, he was overtaken
by death.</p>
<p>5. The Translation of 10 Tracts of St. Basil and 8 of Gregory Nazianzen. These are to be
found in the works of Basil and Gregory, but without Prefaces; they are, however, mentioned
by Rufinus himself in his Eccl. Hist. ii. 9, and in a letter to Apronianus quoted by Fontanini
Vit. Ruf. II., viii, I. col. 189.</p>
<p>6. The Sentences of Xystus, which have been variously attributed to a philosopher who
flourished in the reign of Augustus, and is quoted by Seneca, and to Xystus, or Sixtus, Bp.
of Rome, who suffered martyrdom in 258. They are called the Annulus (᾽εγχειρίδιον) as
inseparable from the hand. Rufinus speaks of them in his Preface, translated in this volume,
as being traditionally ascribed to the Bishop; he does not pledge himself to this opinion, but
does not deny it; and recent research has shown that, though they may have a basis in heathen
philosophy, they are in their present form the writings of a Christian. Jerome, however,
scoffs at Rufinus again and again, as either through ignorance or heterodoxy ascribing to a
Christian Bishop and martyr the work of a Pythagorean (See Jerome ad Ctesiphontem (Ep.
cxxxiii. c. 3), Comm. on Ezek. B. vi. ch. 8, on Jerem. B. iv. ch. 22. The whole matter is fully
discussed in Dict. of Christian Biog. Art. Xystus.)</p>
<p>7. The Sentences of Evagrius Ponticus (or Iberita or Galatus) in three treatises, (1) to
Virgins, (2) To Monks, (3) On the Passionless State. These are described with bitter depreciation
as heretical works by Jerome (Ad Ctes. Ep. 133 c. 3. Pref. to Anti-Pelagian Dialogue
and to B. iv. of Comm. on Jerem.) but approved by Gennadius (c. 9.) who issued an amended
version of Rufinus’ translation. Rufinus’ translation is said to be in the Vatican library by
Fontanini (Vita Rufini Lib. II. c. iv. in Migne’s Patrologia Vol. 21 col. 205.)</p>
<p>8. The Recognitions of Clement supposed to have been written by Clement Bishop of
Rome, but now known to be a work of 50 or 60 years later. The translation of it was asked
for by Silvia sister of Rufinus the Prætorian Prefect, and was unsuccessfully attempted by

<pb n="1084"/>
Paulinus of Nola (see his letter to Rufinus in Fontanini as above, col. 208.) After the death
of Silvia, Gaudentius Bp. of Brixia where she died as a saint, urged Rufinus to make the
translation (Peror. to Ep. to Rom. 567) Preface of Rufinus.)</p>
<p>9. The translation of Eusebius’ Eccl. History in 9 books, a work much valued in Gaul,
and often reprinted in later times. The Preface (Migne’s Rufinus col. 461) is addressed to
Chromatius, and says that it was demanded by him at the time of Alaric’s invasion of Italy
(a.d. 400) as an antidote to the unsettlement of men’s minds. Rufinus speaks humbly of
himself as having little practice in Latin writing. He says that he has compressed the 10th
book which contained little of real history, and added what remained of it to Book 9. See
Prolegomena to Eusebius in this Series Vol. i. p. 54.</p>
<p>It is a curious and important fact that all the translations known to have been made by
Rufinus have survived. This is due no doubt to their being the only translations extant in
the Middle Ages of great writers like Origen and Basil, and to the impossibility of procuring
others. The uncritical spirit of the time may have been favourable to them. Had they been
recognized as the works of Rufinus, they might have been destroyed; but it was possible,
even after the revival of learning, to attribute many of them to Jerome.</p>
<p>Gennadius mentions a series of Rufinus’ letters, which have not survived, amongst
which were several of special importance addressed to Proba, a lady who is highly commended
by Jerome in his letter to Demetrias.2771 Jerome also mentions (537) some translations
of Rufinus from Latin into Greek, but his allusion is somewhat vague; and some translations
from the LXX (536). A translation of Josephus, and a Commentary on the first 75 Psalms,
and on Hosea, Joel and Amos, a Life of St. Eugenia and a Book on the Faith have been attributed
to Rufinus but are believed not to be his. These, with the exception of the translation
of Josephus, are given by Vallarsi in his edition of Rufinus. Besides these, translations of
Origen’s Seven Homilies on Matthew and one on John, and of his treatises on Mary Magdalen
and on Christ’s Epiphany have at times been attributed to Rufinus.</p>
<p>We do not propose to go minutely into the Bibliography of Rufinus’ Works. Some of
them were among the earliest printed books. The Editio Princeps of the Commentary on
the Creed bears date Oxford, 1468 but is commonly believed to be really of 1478; that of the
Ecclesiastical History, Paris, 1474; that of the History of the Monks, undated, is believed to
be of 1471; that of the Commentaries of Origen is of 1503 (Aldus Minutius); that of the
Sayings of Xystus, of 1507, and of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν is of 1514 (Venice). They continued to
be reprinted up to 1580; but, with the exception of the Sayings of Xystus, no further editions
were published till the edition of Vallarsi (Verona, 1745), and the Life by Fontanini (Rome,
1742). Since that date, though various editions and translations of the Expositions of the
<note type="footnote">2771 Letter cxxx, 7.</note>

<pb n="1085"/>
Creed have appeared, no attempt has been made to give the whole of Rufinus’ writings.
Migne (Patrologia, Vol. xxi., Paris, 1849) is contented to reprint Vallarsi without alteration.</p>
<p>No complete edition of Rufinus’ Works, therefore, exists. The volume of Migne’s
Patrologia (21) contains the Life by Fontanini (Rome, 1742), the Notice by Schoenemann
(Leipzig, 1792), and Vallarsi’s edition (Verona, 1745) of Rufinus’ chief works, viz. The Benedictions
of the Patriarchs, the Commentary on the Creed, the Monastic History, the Ecclesiastical
History, the Apology against Jerome, and the Apology addressed to Anastasius.
Vallarsi had intended to edit the Translations from Greek writers, but did not accomplish
this. The Prefaces to these translations, some of which are of great importance, have therefore
to be sought by the student in the editions of the writers to whose works they are prefixed.
They are collected and translated in this Volume for the first time.</p>
<p>We have in the present work not attempted to translate all the original works of Rufinus.
We have omitted the Exposition of the Benedictions of the Twelve patriarchs, the Ecclesiastical
History and the History of the Monks. The rest we have given. They include his Apologies,
together with the Letter of Pope Anastasius about him to John of Jerusalem, the Prefaces
to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν and the Apology of Pamphilus, and the Epilogue to the latter work, called
the Dissertation on the adulteration of the Works of Origen, together with the Prefaces
which are still extant to his Translations of Origen’s Commentaries and his Peroration to
Origen on Romans. We have also included his best known work, his Commentary on the
Creed, a translation of which has kindly been placed at our service by Dr. Heurtley, Lady
Margaret Professor of Theology at Oxford.</p>

<head>WRITINGS OF RUFINUS.</head>
<head>Preface to the Commentary on the Benedictions of the
Twelve Patriarchs.</head>
<p>Rufinus had arrived with Melania, in Italy, in the spring of 397, after a stay in the East
of some 25 years. They had visited Paulinus at Nola, and had been entertained by him with
the highest honours. Melania probably remained in Campania, where she had property,
engaged in family affairs; but Rufinus set out for Rome. He stopped, however, for some
months at the monastery of Pinetum near Terracina, with his friend Urseius the Abbot.</p>
<p>His work on Jacob’s Benedictions on his sons in Gen. xlix was occasioned by the following
letter from Paulinus, who alludes to it in writing to Sulpicius Severus (Ep. xxviii). “I have
written a short note to the Presbyter Rufinus, the companion of the saintly Melania in her
spiritual journey, a truly holy and truly learned man, and one united with me on this account
in the closest affection.” The work itself, being an Exposition of Scripture, is not given, but
only the Preface.</p>
<p>Paulinus to his brother Rufinus, all best wishes.2772</p>
<p>1. Even a short letter from one so likeminded as yourself is a great refreshment, like the
dew which revives a thirsty field when the rivers are low. But while I confess that I have
been refreshed by this letter which, though short, is still from you, and is sent by the servant
of our common children, yet I have been troubled at hearing that all at once through the
disquiet of your anxiety and the uncertainty caused by delay, you have determined that you
must go to Rome. May the Lord grant you to receive joy in the Lord from what we are doing:
so that, as now we share in your anxiety, so we may rejoice in your joy, and that we may
still have some beginnings of hope that we may enjoy your presence, when you begin to see
clearly your way and the will of the Lord concerning you.</p>
<p>2. You are kind enough, with that affection which makes you love me as yourself, to
desire that I should take up more seriously the study of Greek literature. I acknowledge the
kindness which dictates this wish; but I am unable to give it effect, unless, through God’s
<note type="footnote">2772 Salutem, a word implying well-being generally as well as health.</note>

<pb n="1087"/>
blessing on my earnest desires, I should have the happiness of your company for a longer
time. How can I gain any proficiency in a foreign tongue in the absence of him who might
teach me what I do not know? I think that, in the matter of the translation of St. Clement,2773
besides the other defects of my abilities, you noticed this especially as showing the weakness
caused by my want of practice, that where I had been unable to understand the words or to
express them accurately, I have translated them according to my idea of their drift, or, to
speak more truly, set down what I thought ought to be there. All the more therefore do I
need that, through God’s mercy, I may have your company in fuller measure; for that will
be like wealth to the poor or like gathering the crumbs which fall from the rich man’s table
with the eager appetite of the bondman’s heart.</p>
<p>3. At the moment when I was writing these words my eye fell upon a passage of Scripture,
occurring in a portion which I had set down for reading, namely that in which Judah is
blessed by Jacob; and I determined after a time to knock at the door of your mind, for which
the Lord had given me this most timely occasion. I beg you, if you love me, or rather because
you love me so greatly, to write and say how you understand this blessing of the Patriarchs;
and, if there are some things in it which are worth knowing but hard to understand, impart
to me also the knowledge of them; especially of that passage which says: “Binding his colt
to the vine and his ass’s2774 colt to the haircloth.”2775 Tell me what is the colt and the ass’s
colt, and why his colt is to be bound to the vine, but the ass’s colt to the hair cloth.</p>
<p>The answer of Rufinus forms the Preface to his Exposition of the Benedictions.</p>
<p>1. The more I excuse myself to you, and the more I assert that I am unable to respond
to your inquiries, the more instant you become in your requests, and the harder become
your demands: you treat me as you would an ox whose laziness you have discovered, and
prick his flanks and back as he stops and turns back with goads of ever increasing sharpness.
I must point out to you, therefore, that, even if I am able to bow my neck low so as just to
drag the heavy yoke which you lay upon me, yet I have no chance of bursting at a rapid pace
into the open and wide-spreading plains through a form of speech which flows at large and
pours itself forth over far-extending space. Bear with me therefore if my resolution has been
but tardily fulfilled, and if I come up only at a feeble pace to the point to which you call me.</p>
<p>2. You ask me how the passage in Genesis is to be understood in which Israel the father
of the patriarchs is represented as predicting what he saw would happen to each of his sons,
<note type="footnote">2773 That is, the Recognitions. See the Preface to Rufinus’ Translation in this volume, with the explanatory
note prefixed to it.</note>
<note type="footnote">2774 Gen. xlix. ii</note>
<note type="footnote">2775 This is a mistaken reading (though said by Vallarsi to be accepted by both Ambrose and Augustin), Cilicium
for ἕλικι. Rufinus adopts the latter. “Binding his ass’s colt to the tendril of the vine.”</note>

<pb n="1088"/>
and says of Judah, amongst other things: “Binding his colt to the vine, and his ass’s colt to
the tendril of the vine.” You write it “and his ass’s colt to the haircloth” (cilicium); but in
the Greek it stands: καὶ τῇ ἕλικι τὸν πῶλον τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ. The Greeks call by the name
ἕλικα(twist) not the sprigs of the vine (as our copies have it) but those sickle-like shoots2776
by which it supports itself on branches of trees or poles or the supports of the kind which I
think the farmers call goatikins;2777 so that the vine is made safe by these clinging shoots
from all danger of falling, and the tendril can either become loaded with grapes or grow out
in unfettered length. I think therefore that this very word (helici), like some others, must
have been set down a long time ago in the Latin versions, and that it was afterwards supposed
by unintelligent copyists that by helici, hair-cloth (cilicium) must be meant.</p>
<p>3. It is easy in this way to emend the mistakes of the translation; but it is not so easy to
find out the meaning of the expression itself unless we take into consideration the whole
passage. But the treatment of this passage would be placed in a fuller and clearer light if we
could go back to the beginning of the whole of these Benedictions. But this implies no small
amount of leisure and of time; or, to speak in a more Christian sense, it demands a mind
illuminated by the Holy Spirit. My talent is but slight, and there are many demands on my
time; and my friends are urging me to comply with their requests about Origen.2778 But,
so far as these circumstances admit, and so great a matter can be treated with brevity, I will
state at once what appears to me the true meaning of this passage, for the love with which
you bid me trust you in everything, and without prejudice to the judgment of others, who
may have something better to say about it.</p>
<note type="footnote">2776 The word in the text rucinnulos is unknown in Latin. The most likely conjecture as to the right reading
is ruscarias quibus (that is ruscarias falculas—sickles for weeding out butcher’s broom, as mentioned by Cato

<head>Preface to Book II.</head>
<p>Rufinus, as we see by his Preface to the former book, considered it unsatisfactory to
expound the Blessing upon Judah apart from those on his brethren. Paulinus therefore,
taking the occasion of their common friend Cerealis’ journey to Rome, sends the following
letter to induce Rufinus to expound the remaining Benedictions.</p>
<p>Paulinus to his brother Rufinus, all good wishes.</p>
<p>1. Although our son Cerealis declared to me that it was uncertain whether, in returning
as he now does to St. Peter,2779 he would be able to visit you, yet it appears to me that it
would be blamable in me and vexatious to you were I not to write to you by him in whom
you have a part as well as I. It seems to me preferable to lose some letter paper by his not
visiting you rather than to lose credit with you as I think I should do by his visiting you
without it: and therefore I have entrusted this letter, I will not say to chance, but to faith:
for I believe that the Lord will direct to you the way both of our son and of my letter; since
to those who long for good all will turn to good; and indeed he longs for you as you ought
to be longed for by one who understands the good he may gain from your society. I believe
that this longing of his in a good matter will not be lost, according to his faith and piety:
and therefore I have confidence that he will reach you and abide with you, and that I shall
see the saving help of the Lord doubled towards you, since in him you will have the accession
of a good son and pupil and assistant, and he will find in you a father and teacher of all good
things given to him from the Lord, who will add to the efficacy and power of his prayers
the strength of spiritual grace. As to myself, though I have the assurance that when you return
to the East you will be unwilling to depart without visiting me, yet my sins make me fear
that the daughter of Babylon, may turn you away from me. I pray therefore with earnest
longings to the Lord that he would give me not according to my deserts but according to
my desire and may direct your course to me in the way of peace; for such as do not walk in
that way are reprobate and condemned and incapable of truly longing for your presence.</p>
<p>2. But now for the business part of my letter. I charge you, with the importunity, with
which I am in the habit of knocking at your door even in the middle of the night, being
driven by fear of a refusal to the modest attitude of a supplicant, to show me kindness once
more, and to expound the Benedictions on the twelve Patriarchs. You have already made a
beginning with the prophecy relating to Judah, and have given, according to the precept, a
threefold interpretation of it. I now beg you to expound the prophecy as it relates to each
of the sons of Judah: so that I may myself become possessed of the truth by your means,
and may also gain through your help the favor and the praise which will accrue to me; for
<note type="footnote">2779 That is to Rome.</note>

<pb n="1090"/>
I shall thus be able to make answer to those who have thought well to consult me on the
difficulties of this passage of Scripture not with foolish words drawn from my own understanding
but with divine truth flowing from your inspiration.</p>
<p>Rufinus, though at this time busy with his larger works, the translations of Pamphilus’
defence of Origen, and Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, and, though about to set out for Rome, lost
no time in composing the work which Paulinus demanded, and sent it him with the following
letter.</p>
<p>Rufinus to His Brother Paulinus, the Man of God, with All Good Wishes.</p>
<p>1. Though our common son Cerealis did not visit me, he felt what pain he would cause
me if he delayed my reception of your letter, and forwarded it to me. In reading it I felt, as
usual, a continual increase in my yearning towards you: but I found towards its close a request
from which I have frequently begged you to excuse me—I mean the request which you make
that I should write something in answer to your questions as to the interpretation of passages
of Scripture. I thought that I should lead you to desist from these questions by the writings
I have once and again sent you, which have given evidence of my ignorance and of the
roughness of my speech.</p>
<p>2. But since you still are not weary of commanding me, I have at once, to the best of my
powers, added to what I had written at your desire on the Benediction of Judah the comments
on the remaining eleven patriarchs. I acted like the man in the parable of the two sons. I
thought that I should thus best fulfil the father’s will: and though when he ordered me to
go into the vineyard I had said I will not go, yet after a while I went. If, as I grant, there is
some rashness in the fact that with so little capacity we attempt such a great task, I would
say, with submission to you, that this must be most justly imputed to you, since, through
your excessive love for me you do not see that my measure of knowledge, as of other virtues,
is but slight. I wrote this work in the days of Lent, while I was staying in the monastery of
Pinetum, and I wrote it for you. But I found it impossible to conceal this poor work from
the brethren who were there: and they, considering that a thing which had been honoured
by your approval must be of great importance, extorted from me the permission to copy it
for themselves. Thus, while you demand from me food for yourself you give refreshment
to others also. Farewell, and be in peace, my most loving brother, most true worshipper of
God, and an Israelite in whom there is no guile. I entreat you who are so full of the grace of
God to hold me still in remembrance.</p>

<head>Translation of Pamphilus’ Defence of Origen.</head>
<p>Written at Pinetum a.d. 397.</p>
<p>While Rufinus was staying at Pinetum, a Christian named Macarius2780 sought his advice
and assistance. He was engaged in a controversy with the Mathematici, a class of men who
had deserted the scientific studies from which they took their name, and had turned to astrology
and a belief in Fatalism. Macarius, having heard of Origen’s greatness in the region
of Christian speculation, earnestly desired some knowledge of his writings: but was unable
to attain it through ignorance of Greek. He declared to Rufinus that he had had a dream in
which he saw a ship laden with Eastern merchandize arriving in Italy, and that it was declared
to him that this ship would contain the means of attaining the knowledge he desired. The
coming of Rufinus seemed to him the fulfilment of his dream, and he earnestly besought
him to impart to him some of the treasures of his Greek learning, and especially to translate
for him Origen’s great speculative work, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, that is On First Principles.2781
Rufinus hesitated, knowing that there was a strong prejudice against Origen, and that he
was looked on, especially in the West, as a heretic, though his writings were little known
there. He yielded, however, to the solicitations of Macarius: but to guard against the imputation
of heresy, he undertook three preliminary works. First, he translated the Apology of
the Martyr Pamphilus for Origen; secondly, he wrote a short treatise on the Adulteration
by heretics of the works of Origen; and, thirdly, in translating the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν he prefixed
to it an elaborate Preface in justification of his course in translating the work. All these
documents became the subject of vehement controversy which found its expression in the
letter of Jerome to his friends at Rome, and the Apologies of Rufinus and Jerome translated
in this volume.</p>
<p>The Apology of Pamphilus for Origen forms the sixth book of a work undertaken by
him in connexion with Eusebius of Cæsarea, the Church Historian. Pamphilus was a great
collector of books, and a learned man, but Eusebius was the chief writer. Pamphilus was
put to death in the last persecution, that under Galerius; and Eusebius having at a later time
fallen under suspicion of Arianism, it was attempted by those who disliked Origen, to dissociate
Pamphilus from all connexion with the work. There seems however no reason to doubt,
notwithstanding Jerome’s violent protestations, that Pamphilus was associated with Eusebius
throughout the work, and that he actually wrote the sixth book. The translation of this
Apology was made first, and sent out with a Preface which runs as follows:</p>
<note type="footnote">2780 See the account in Rufinus’ Apology I. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">2781 The word may also mean On beginnings, or On Principalities and Powers: these ideas being connected
together in the speculation of the Alexandrian theology.</note>

<pb n="1092"/>
<p>You have been moved by your desire to know the truth, Macarius, who are “a man
greatly beloved,”2782 to make a request of me, which will bring you the blessing attached to
the knowledge of the truth; but it will win for me the greatest indignation on the part of
those who consider themselves aggrieved whenever any one does not think evil of Origen.
It is true that it is not my opinion about him that you have asked for, but that of the holy
martyr Pamphilus; and you have requested to have the book which he is said to have written
in his defence in Greek translated for you into Latin: nevertheless I do not doubt that there
will be some who will think themselves aggrieved if I say anything in his defence even in
the words of another man. I beg them to do nothing in the spirit of presumption and of
prejudice; and, since we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, not to refuse to
hear the truth spoken, lest haply they should do wrong through ignorance. Let them consider
that to wound the consciences of their weaker brethren by false accusations is to sin against
Christ; and therefore let them not lend their ears to the accusers, nor seek an account of
another man’s faith from a third party, especially when an opportunity is given them for
gaining personal and direct knowledge, and the substance and quality of each man’s faith
is to be known by his own confession. For so the Scripture says:2783 “With the heart man
believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation”:
and:2784 “By his words shall each man be justified, and by his word shall he be condemned.”
The opinions of Origen in the various parts of Scripture are clearly set forth in the present
work: as to the cause of our finding certain places in which he contradicts himself, an explanation
will be offered in the short document subjoined.2785 But as for myself, I hold that
which has been handed down to us from the holy fathers, namely, that the Holy Trinity is
coeternal, and of a single nature, virtue and substance; that the Son of God in these last times
has been made man, has suffered for our transgressions and rose again from the dead in the
very flesh in which he suffered, and thereby imparted the hope of the resurrection to the
whole race of mankind. When we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so, not with
any subterfuges, as is slanderously reported by certain persons; we believe that it is this very
flesh in which we are now living which will rise again, not one kind of flesh instead of another,
nor another body than the body of this flesh. When we speak of the body rising we
do so in the words of the apostle; for he himself made use of this word: and when we speak
of the flesh, our confession is that of the Creed. It is an absurd invention of maliciousness
to think that the human body is different from the flesh. However, whether we speak of that
which is to rise, according to the common faith, as the flesh, or, according to the Apostle,
<note type="footnote">2782 Daniel x. 11, ix. 23. The name Macarius means Blessed.</note>
<note type="footnote">2783 Rom. x. 10</note>
<note type="footnote">2784 Matt. xii. 37</note>
<note type="footnote">2785 See the Epilogue, infra.</note>

<pb n="1093"/>
as the body, this we must believe, that according to the clear statement of the Apostle, that
which shall rise shall rise in power and in glory; it will rise an incorruptible and a spiritual
body: for “corruption cannot inherit incorruption.” We must maintain this preëminence
of the body, or flesh, which is to be: but, with this proviso, we must hold that the resurrection
of the flesh is perfect and entire; we must on the one hand maintain the identity of the flesh,
while on the other we must not detract from the dignity and glory of the incorruptible and
spiritual body. For so the Scripture speaks. This is what is preached by the reverend Bishop
John at Jerusalem; this we with him both confess and hold. If any one either believes or
teaches otherwise, or insinuates that we believe differently from the exposition of our faith,
let him be anathema. Let this then be taken as a record of our belief by any who desire to
know it. Whatever we read and whatever we do is in accordance with this account of our
faith; we follow the words of the Apostle,2786 “proving all things, holding fast that which is
good, avoiding every form of evil.”2787 “And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon
them and upon the Israel of God.”</p>

<head>Rufinus’s Epilogue to Pamphilus the Martyr’s Apology
for Origen
otherwise
The Book Concerning the Adulteration of the Works of Origen.</head>
<head>Addressed to Macarius at Pinetum a.d. 397.</head>
<p>The next work was sent out at the same time with Pamphilus’ Apology. Rufinus believed
that Origen’s works had been adulterated by heretics so as to turn his assertions into support
of their own opinions. He therefore, in his translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, altered many
things which had a heterodox meaning as found in the ordinary mss. of Origen, so as to
make the work consistent with itself and with the orthodox views expressed in other parts
of Origen’s writings. How far this process was legitimate or honest must be judged from a
perusal of the controversy which followed; but it should be borne in mind, first, that the
standard of literary exactness and conscientiousness was not the same in those days as in
ours; secondly, that when everything depended on copyists there was room for infinite
variations in the copies, whether through negligence, ignorance or fraud; thirdly, that the
principles adopted by Rufinus were precisely those acknowledged by his great opponent
Jerome, in his Treatise De Optimo Genere Interpretandi, and his Letter to Vigilantius
(Letters lxvi and lxi).</p>
<p>My object in the translation from Greek into Latin of the holy martyr Pamphilus’
Apology for Origen, which I have given in the preceding volume according to my ability
and the requirements of the matter, is this: I wish you to know through full information
that the rule of faith which has been set forth above in his writings is that which we must
embrace and hold; for it is clearly shown that the Catholic opinion is contained in them all.
Nevertheless you have to allow that there are found in his books certain things not only
different from this but in certain cases even repugnant to it; things which our canons of
truth do not sanction, and which we can neither receive nor approve. As to the cause of this
an opinion has reached me which has been widely entertained, and which I wish to be fully
known by you and by those who desire to know what is true, since it is possible also that
some who have before been actuated by the love of fault-finding may acquiesce in the truth
and reason of the matter when they have it set before them; for some seem determined to
believe anything in the world to be true rather than that which withdraws from them the

<pb n="1095"/>
occasions of fault-finding. It must, I think, be felt to be wholly impossible that a man so
learned and so wise, a man whom even his accusers may well admit to have been neither
foolish nor insane, should have written what is contrary and repugnant to himself and his
own opinions. But even suppose that this could in some way have happened; suppose, as
some perhaps have said, that in the decline of life he might have forgotten what he had
written in his early days, and have made assertions at variance with his former opinions;
how are we to deal with the fact that we sometimes find in the very same passages, and, as
I may say, almost in successive sentences, clauses inserted expressive of contrary opinions?
Can we believe that in the same work and in the same book, and even sometimes, as I have
said, in the following paragraph, a man could have forgotten his own views? For example
that, when he had said just before that no passage in all the Scripture could be found in
which the Holy Spirit was spoken of as made or created, he could have immediately added
that the Holy Spirit had been made along with the rest of the creatures? or again, that the
same man who clearly states that the Father and the Son are of one substance, or as it is
called in Greek Homoousion, could in the next sentence say that He was of another substance,
and was a created being, when he had but a little before described him as born of the very
nature of God the Father? Or again in the matter of the resurrection of the flesh, could he
who so clearly declared that it was the nature of the flesh which ascended with the Word of
God into heaven, and there appeared to the celestial Powers, presenting a new image of
himself for them to worship, could he, I ask you, possibly turn round and say that this flesh
was not to be saved? Such things could not happen even in the case of a man who had taken
leave of his senses and was not sound in the brain. How, therefore, this came to pass, I will
point out with all possible brevity. The heretics are capable of any violence, they have no
remorse and no scruples: this we are forced to recognize by the audacities of which they
have been frequently convicted. And, just as their father the devil has from the beginning
made it his object to falsify the words of God and twist them from their true meaning, and
subtilely to interpolate among them his own poisonous ideas, so he has left these successors
of his the same art as their inheritance. Accordingly, when God had said to Adam, “You
shall eat of all the trees of the garden;” he, when he wished to deceive Eve interpolated a
single syllable, by which he reduced within the narrowest bounds God’s liberality in permitting
all the fruits to be eaten. He said: “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of
the garden?” and thus by suggesting the complaint that God’s command was severe, he
more easily persuaded her to transgress the precept. The heretics have followed the example
of their father, the craft of their teacher. Whenever they found in any of the renowned writers
of old days a discussion of those things which pertain to the glory of God so full and faithful
that every believer could gain profit and instruction from it, they have not scrupled to infuse
into their writings the poisonous taint of their own false doctrines; this they have done,
either by inserting things which the writers had not said or by changing by interpolation

<pb n="1096"/>
what they had said, so that their own poisonous heresy might more easily be asserted and
authorized by passing under the name of all the church writers of the greatest learning and
renown; they meant it to appear that well-known and orthodox men had held as they did.
We hold the clearest proofs of this in the case of the Greek writers and this adulteration of
books is to be found in the case of many of the ancients; but it will suffice to adduce the
testimony of a few, so that it may be more easily understood what has befallen the writings
of Origen.</p>
<p>Clement, the disciple of the Apostles, who was bishop of the Roman church next to the
Apostles, was a martyr, wrote the work which is called in the Greek ᾽Αναγνωρισμός, or in
Latin, The Recognition.2788 In these books he sets forth again and again in the name of the
Apostle Peter a doctrine which appears to be truly apostolical: yet in certain passages the
heresy of Eunomius is so brought in that you would imagine that you were listening to an
argument of Eunomius himself, asserting that the Son of God was created out of no existing
elements. Then again that other method of falsification is introduced, by which it is made
to appear that the nature of the devil and of other demons has not resulted from the
wickedness of their will and purpose, but from an exceptional and separate quality of their
creation, although he in all other places had taught that every reasonable creature was endowed
with the faculty of free will. There are also some other things inserted into his books
which the church’s creed does not admit. I ask, then, what we are to think of these things?
Are we to believe that an apostolic man, nay, almost an apostle (since he writes the things
which the apostles speak), one to whom the apostle Paul bore his testimony in the words,
“With Clement and others, my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life” was
the writer of words which contradict the book of life? or are we to say, as we have said before,
that perverse men, in order to gain authority for their own heresies by the use of the names
of holy men, and so procure their readier acceptance, interpolated these things which it is
impossible to believe that the true authors either thought or wrote?</p>
<p>Again, the other Clement, the presbyter of Alexandria, and the teacher of that church,
in almost all his books describes the three Persons as having one and the same glory and
eternity: and yet we sometimes find in his books passages in which he speaks of the Son as
a creature of God. Is it credible that so great a man as he, so orthodox in all points, and so
learned, either held opinions mutually contradictory, or left in writing views concerning
God which it is an impiety, I will not say to believe, but even to listen to?</p>
<note type="footnote">2788 Rufinus was deceived as was the whole world until the revival of learning, in believing this fabrication
to be the work of Clement. It is really a romance in the form of an autobiography of Clement, supposed to be
addressed to James of Jerusalem; and was written probably in Asia Minor or Syria about a.d. 200. See Article
“Clementine Literature” in Dict. of Ch. Biog.</note>

<pb n="1097"/>
<p>Once more, Dionysius the Bishop of Alexandria, was a most learned maintainer of the
church’s faith, and in passages without end defended the unity and eternity of the Trinity,
so earnestly that some persons of less insight imagine that he held the views of Sabellius;
yet in the books which he wrote against the heresy of Sabellius, there are things inserted of
such a character that the Arians endeavour to shield themselves under his authority, and
on this account the holy Bishop Athanasius felt himself compelled to write an apology for
his work, because he was assured that he could not have held strange opinions or have
written things in which he contradicted himself, but felt sure that these things had been interpreted
by ill disposed men.</p>
<p>This opinion we have been led to form by the force of the facts themselves, in the case
of these very reverend men and doctors of the church; we have found it impossible, I say,
to believe that those reverend men who again and again have supported the church’s belief
should in particular points have held opinions contradictory to themselves. As to Origen,
however, in whom, as I have said above, are to be found, as in those others, certain diversities
of statement, it will not be sufficient to think precisely as we think or feel about those who
enjoy an established reputation for orthodoxy; nor could a similar charge be met by a similar
excuse, were it not that its validity is shown by words and writings of his own in which he
makes this fact the subject of earnest complaint. What he had to suffer while still living in
the flesh, while still having feeling and sight, from the corruption of his books and treatises,
or from counterfeit versions of them, we may learn clearly from his own letter which he
wrote to certain intimate friends at Alexandria; and by this you will see how it comes to pass
that some things which are self-contradictory are found in his writings.2789</p>
<p>“Some of those persons who take a pleasure in accusing their neighbours, bring against
us and our teaching the charge of blasphemy, though from us they have never heard anything
of the kind. Let them take heed to themselves how they refuse to mark that solemn injunction
which says that2790 ‘Revilers shall not inherit the kingdom of God,’ when they declare that
I hold that the father of wickedness and perdition, and of those who are cast forth from the
kingdom of God, that is the devil, is to be saved, a thing which no man can say even if he
has taken leave of his senses and is manifestly insane. Yet it is no wonder, I think, if my
teaching is falsified by my adversaries, and is corrupted and adulterated in the same manner
as the epistle of Paul the Apostle. Certain men, as we know, compiled a false epistle under
the name of Paul, so that they might trouble the Thessalonians as if the day of the Lord were
<note type="footnote">2789 The letter is headed “On the adulteration and corruption of his books; from the 4th book of the letters

nigh at hand, and thus beguile them. It is on account of that false epistle that he wrote these
words in the second epistle to the Thessalonians:2791 ‘We beseech you, brethren, by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together unto him; to the end that ye be
not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit or by word or by
letter as sent from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man beguile you in any
wise.’ It is something of the same kind, I perceive, which is happening to us also. A certain
promoter of heresy, after a discussion which had been held between us in the presence of
many persons, and notes of it had been taken, procured the document from those who had
written out the notes, and added or struck out whatever he chose, and changed things as he
thought right, and published it abroad as if it were my work, but pointing in triumphant
scorn at the expressions which he had himself inserted. The brethren in Palestine, indignant
at this, sent a man to me at Athens to obtain from me an authentic copy of the work. Up to
that time I had never even read it over again or revised it: it had been so completely neglected
and thrown aside that it could hardly be found. Nevertheless, I sent it: and,—God is witness
that I am speaking the truth,—when I met the man himself who had adulterated the work,
and took him to task for having done so, he answered, as if he were giving me satisfaction:
“I did it because I wished to improve that treatise and to purge away its faults.” What kind
of a purging was this that he applied to my dissertation? such a purging as Marcion or his
successor Apelles after him gave to the Gospels and to the writings of the Apostle. They
subverted the true text of Scripture; and this man similarly first took away the true statements
which I had made, and then inserted what was false to furnish grounds for accusation against
me. But, though those who have dared to do this are impious and heretical men, yet those
who give credence to such accusations against us shall not escape the judgment of God.
There are others also, not a few, who have done this through a wish to throw confusion into
the churches. Lately, a certain heretic who had seen me at Ephesus and had refused to meet
me, and had not opened his mouth in my presence, but for some reason or other had avoided
doing so, afterwards composed a dissertation according to his own fancy, partly mine, partly
his own, and sent it to his disciples in various places: I know that it reached those who were
in Rome, and I doubt not that it reached others also. He was behaving in the same reckless
way at Antioch also before I came there: and the dissertation which he brought with him
came into the hands of many of our friends. But when I arrived, I took him to task in the
presence of many persons, and, when he persisted, with a complete absence of shame, in
the impudent defence of his forgery, I demanded that the book should be brought in amongst
us, so that my mode of speech might be recognized by the brethren, who of course knew
the points on which I am accustomed to insist and the method of teaching which I employ.
He did not, however, venture to bring in the book, and his assertions were refuted by them
<note type="footnote">2791 2 Thess. ii. 1–3</note>

<pb n="1099"/>
all and he himself was convicted of forgery, and thus the brethren were taught a lesson not
to give ear to such accusations. If then any one is willing to trust me at all—I speak as in the
sight of God—let him believe what I say about the things which are falsely inserted in my
letter. But if any man refuses to believe me, and chooses to speak evil of me, it is not to me
that he does the injury: he will himself be arraigned as a false witness before God, since he
is either bearing false witness against his neighbour, or giving credit to those who bear it.”</p>
<p>Such are the complaints which he made while still living, and while he was still able to
detect the corruptions and falsifications which had been made in his books. There is another
letter of his, in which I remember to have read a complaint of the falsifying of his writings;
but I have not a copy of it at hand, otherwise I could add to those which I have quoted a
second testimony in favour of his good faith and veracity direct from himself. But I think
that I have said enough to satisfy those who listen to what is said, not in the interest of strife
and detraction, but in that of a love of truth. I have shown and proved in the case of the
saintly men of whom I have made mention, and of whose orthodoxy is no question, that,
where the tenor of a book is presumably right, anything which is found in it contrary to the
faith of the church is more properly believed to have been inserted by heretics than to have
been written by the author: and I cannot think it an absurd demand that the same thing
should be believed in the case of Origen, not only because the argument is similar but because
of the witness given by himself in the complaints which I have brought out from his writings:
otherwise we must believe that, like a silly or insane person, he has written in contradiction
to himself.</p>
<p>As to the possibility that the heretics may have acted in the violent manner supposed,
such wickedness may easily be believed of them. They have given a specimen of it, which
makes it credible in the present case, in the fact that they have been unable to keep off their
impious hands even from the sacred words of the Gospel. Any one who has a mind to see
how they have acted in the case of the Acts of the Apostles or their Epistles, how they have
befouled them and gnawed them away, how they have defiled them in every kind of way,
sometimes adding words which expressed their impious doctrine, sometimes taking out the
opposing truths, will understand it most fully if he will read the books of Tertullian written
against Marcion. It is no great thing that they should have corrupted the writings of Origen
when they have dared to corrupt the sayings of God our Saviour. It is true that some persons
may withhold their assent from what I am saying on the ground of the difference of the
heresies; since it was one kind of heresy the partisans of which corrupted the Gospels, but
it is another which is aimed at in these passages which, as we assert, have been inserted in
the works of Origen. Let those who have such doubts consider that, as in all the saints dwells
the one spirit of God (for the Apostle says,2792 “The spirits of the prophets are subject to
<note type="footnote">2792 1 Cor. xiv. 32</note>

<pb n="1100"/>
the prophets,” and again,2793 “We all have been made to drink of that one spirit”); so also
in all the heretics dwells the one spirit of the devil, who teaches them all and at all times the
same or similar wickedness.</p>
<p>There may, however, be some to whom the instances we have given have less persuasive
force because they have to do with Greek writers; and therefore, although it is a Greek writer
for whom I am pleading, yet, since it is the Latin tongue which is, so to speak, entrusted
with the argument, and they are Latin people before whom you have earnestly begged me
to plead the cause of these men, and to show what wounds they suffer by the calumnious
renderings of their works, it will be satisfactory to show that things of the same kind have
happened to Latin as well as Greek writers, and that men approved for their saintly character
have had a storm of calumny raised against them by the falsification of their works. I will
recount things of still recent memory, so that nothing may be lacking to the manifest credibility
of my contention, and its truth may lie open for all to see.</p>
<p>Hilary Bishop of Pictavium2794 was a believer in the Catholic doctrine, and wrote a very
complete work of instruction with the view of bringing back from their error those who had
subscribed the faithless creed of Ariminum.2795 This book fell into the hands of his adversaries
and ill wishers, whether, as some said, by bribing his secretary, or by no matter what
other cause. He knew nothing of this: but the book was so falsified by them, the saintly man
being all the while entirely unconscious of it, that, when his enemies began to accuse him
of heresy in the episcopal assembly, as holding what they knew they had corruptly inserted
in his manuscript, he himself demanded the production of his book as evidence of his faith.
It was brought from his house, and was found to be full of matter which he repudiated: but
it caused him to be excommunicated and to be excluded from the meeting of the synod. In
this case, however, though the crime was one of unexampled wickedness, the man who was
the victim of it was alive, and present in the flesh; and the hostile faction could be convicted
and brought to punishment, when their tricks became known and their machinations were
exposed. A remedy was applied through statements, explanations, and similar things: for
living men can take action on their own behalf, the dead can refute no accusations under
which they labour.</p>
<p>Take another case. The whole collection of the letters of the martyr Cyprian is usually
found in a single manuscript. Into this collection certain heretics who held a blasphemous

<note type="footnote">2794 Poictiers.</note>
<note type="footnote">2795 There seem to be no means of throwing light upon this story. Hilary was not at the council of Ariminum,
but at that of Seleucia, held the same year (359). On his return to Gaul in 361 he endeavoured, in various meetings
of bishops to reunite with the Homoousians those who had subscribed the creed of Ariminum. (See Art. on
Hilary Pictav. in Dict. of Christ. Biography.) It may have been in one of these meetings that this scene occurred.</note>

<pb n="1101"/>
doctrine about the Holy Spirit inserted a treatise of Tertullian on the Trinity, which was
faultily expressed though he is himself an upholder of our faith: and from the copies thus
made they wrote out a number of others; these they distributed through the whole of the
vast city of Constantinople at a very low price: men were attracted by this cheapness and
readily bought up the documents full of hidden snares of which they knew nothing; and
thus the heretics found means of gaining credit for their impious doctrines through the
authority of a great name. It happened, however, that, shortly after the publication, there
were found there some of our catholic brothers who were able to expose this wicked fabrication,
and recalled as many as they could reach from the entanglements of error. In this
they partly succeeded. But there were a great many in those parts who remained convinced
that the saintly martyr Cyprian held the belief which had been erroneously expressed by
Tertullian.</p>
<p>I will add one other instance of the falsification of a document. It is one of recent
memory, though it is an example of the primeval subtlety, and it surpasses all the stories of
the ancients.</p>
<p>Bishop Damasus, at the time when a consultation was held in the matter of the reconciling
of the followers of Apollinarius to the church,2796 desired to have a document setting
forth the faith of the church, which should be subscribed by those who wished to be reconciled.
The compiling of this document he entrusted to a certain friend of his, a presbyter
and a highly accomplished man,2797 who usually acted for him in matters of this kind. When
he came to compose the document, he found it necessary, in speaking of the Incarnation of
our Lord, to apply to him the expression “Homo Dominicus.” The Apollinarists2798 took
offence at this expression, and began to impugn it as a novelty. The writer of the document
thereupon undertook to defend himself, and to confute the objectors by the authority of
ancient Catholic writers; and he happened to show to one of those who complained of the
novelty of the expression a book of the bishop Athanasius in which the word which was
under discussion occurred. The man to whom this evidence was offered appeared to be
convinced, and asked that the manuscript should be lent to him so that he might convince
the rest who from their ignorance were still maintaining their objections. When he had got
the manuscript into his hands he devised a perfectly new method of falsification. He first
<note type="footnote">2796 This was in 382, the year after the Council of Constantinople. Jerome had come from Constantinople
to Rome with the Eastern Bishops Epiphanius of Salamis in Cyprus and Paulinus of Antioch. His position at
Rome is described in the words of his letter (cxxiii) to Ageruchia, c. 10. “I was assisting Damasus in matters of
ecclesiastical literature, and answering the questions discussed in the Councils of the East and the West.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2797 Jerome.</note>
<note type="footnote">2798 Apollinaris, in his reaction from Arianism, held that the Godhead supplied the place of the human soul

<pb n="1102"/>
erased the passage in which the expression occurred, and then wrote in again the same
words which he had erased. He returned the paper, and it was accepted without question.
The controversy about this expression again arose; the manuscript was brought forward:
the expression in question was found in it, but in a position where there had been an erasure:
and the man who had brought forward such a manuscript lost all authority, since the erasure
seemed to be the proof of malpractice and falsification. However, in this case as in one which
I mentioned before, it was a living man who was thus treated by a living man, and he at once
did all in his power to lay bare the iniquitous fraud which had been committed, and to remove
the stain of this nefarious act from the man who was innocent and had done no evil of the
kind, and to attach it to the real author of the deed, so that it should completely overwhelm
him with infamy.</p>
<p>Since, then, Origen in his letter complains with his own voice that he has suffered such
things at the hands of the heretics who wished him ill, and similar things have happened in
the case of many other orthodox men among both the dead and the living, and since in the
cases adduced, men’s writings are proved to have been tampered with in a similar way: what
determined obstinacy is this, which refuses to admit the same excuse when the case is the
same, and, when the circumstances are parallel, assigns to one party the allowance due to
respect, but to another infamy due to a criminal. The truth must be told, and must not lie
hid at this point; for it is impossible for any man really to judge so unjustly as to form different
opinions on cases which are similar. The fact is that the prompters of Origen’s accusers are
men who make long controversial discourses in the churches,2799 and even write books the
whole matter of which is borrowed from him, and who wish to deter men of simple mind
from reading him, for fear that their plagiarisms should become widely known, though,
indeed, their appropriations would be no reproach to them if they were not ungrateful to
their master.</p>
<p>For instance, one of these men,2800 who thinks that a necessity is laid upon him,2801
like that of preaching the Gospel, to speak evil of Origen among all nations and tongues,
declared in a vast assembly of Christian hearers that he had read six thousand of his works.
Surely, if his object in reading these were, as he is in the habit of asserting, only to acquaint
himself with Origen’s faults, ten or twenty or at most thirty of these works would have sufficed
<note type="footnote">2799 This is believed to refer to Epiphanius, whose anti-Origenistic sermon at Jerusalem in the year 394
greatly irritated the Bishops John and Rufinus. See Jerome Ep. li, and “Against John of Jerusalem,” c. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">2800 Epiphanius.</note>
<note type="footnote">2801 1 Cor. ix. 16</note>

<pb n="1103"/>
for the purpose. But to read six thousand books is no longer wishing to know the man, but
giving up almost one’s whole life to his teaching and researches. On what ground then can
his words be worthy of credit when he blames men who have only read quite a few of these
books while their rule of faith is kept sacred and their piety unimpaired.</p>
<p>What has been said may suffice to show what opinion we ought to form of the books
of Origen. I think that every one who has at heart the interests of truth, not of controversy,
may easily assent to the well-proved statements I have made. But if any man perseveres in
his contentiousness, we have no such custom.2802 It is a settled custom among us, when we
read him, to hold fast that which is good, according to the apostolic injunction. If we find
in these books anything discrepant to the Catholic faith, we suspect that it has been inserted
by the heretics, and consider it as alien from his opinion as it is from our faith. If, however,
this is a mistake of ours, we run, as I think, no danger from such an error; for we ourselves,
through God’s help, continue unharmed by avoiding what we hold in suspicion and condemn:
and further we shall not be accounted accusers of our brethren before God (you will remember
that the accusing of the brethren is the special work of the devil, and that he received
the name of devil2803 from his being a slanderer). Moreover, we thus escape the sentence
pronounced on evil speakers, which separates those who are such from the kingdom of God.</p>

<head>Preface to the Translations of Origen’s Books Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</head>
<head>Addressed to Macarius, at Pinetum, a.d. 397.</head>
<p>The Translation of the two first Books of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν was issued soon after, or
contemporaneously with the Apology of Pamphilus. The Preface to them was intended to
remove prejudices by showing that Jerome (who though not named is clearly described)
had been Rufinus’ precursor in translating Origen. The compliments paid to Jerome were
no doubt sincere: but the use made of his previous action can hardly be justified. Rufinus
knew well that Jerome’s view of Origen had to some extent altered, that a disagreeable
controversy had sprung up at Jerusalem about him, in which he and Jerome had taken opposite
sides: and that the animosity aroused by this had with the greatest difficulty been allayed,
and a reconciliation effected at the moment when he had quitted Palestine. This
Preface with the Translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν was the most immediate cause of the violent
controversy and the final estrangement between Rufinus and Jerome.</p>
<p>I am aware that a great many of our brethren were incited by their longing for Scriptural
knowledge to demand from various men who were versed in Greek literature that they
would give the works of Origen to men who used the Latin tongue, and thus make him a
Roman. Among these was that brother and associate of mine to whom this request was
made by bishop Damasus, and who when he translated the two homilies on the Song of
Songs from Greek into Latin prefixed to the work a preface2804 so full of beauty and so
magnificent that he awoke in every one the desire of reading Origen and eagerly investigating
his works. He said that to the soul of that great man the words might well be applied:2805
“The King has brought me into his chamber”: and he declared that Origen in his other books
had surpassed all other men, but in this had surpassed himself. What he promises in this
Preface is, indeed, that he will give to Roman ears not only these books but many others of
Origen. But I find that he is so enamoured of his own style that he pursues a still more ambitious
object, namely, that he should be the creator of the book, not merely its translator.
I am then following out a task begun by him and commended by his example; but it is out
of my power to set forth the words of this great man with a force and an eloquence like his:
and I have therefore to fear that it may happen through my fault that the man whom he
<note type="footnote">2804 Translated among Jerome’s works in this Series.</note>
<note type="footnote">2805 Cant. i. 4</note>

<pb n="1105"/>
justly commends as a teacher of the church both in knowledge and in wisdom second only
to the Apostles may be thought to have a far lower rank through my poverty of language.
When I reflected on this I was inclined to keep silence, and not to assent to the brethren
who were constantly adjuring me to make the translation. But your influence is such, my
most faithful brother Macarius, that even the consciousness of my unfitness is not sufficient
to make me resist. I have therefore yielded to your importunity though it was against my
resolution, so that I might no longer be exposed to the demands of a severe taskmaster; but
I have done so on this condition and on this understanding, that in making the translation
I should follow as far as possible the method of my predecessors, and especially of him of
whom I have already made mention. He, after translating into Latin above seventy of the
books of Origen which he called Homiletics, and also a certain number of the “Tomes,”
proceeded to purge and pare away in his translation all the causes of stumbling which are
to be found in the Greek works; and this he did in such a way that the Latin reader will find
nothing in them which jars with our faith. In his steps, therefore, I follow, not, indeed, with
the power of eloquence which is his, but, as far as may be, in his rules and method, that is,
taking care not to promulgate those things which are found in the books of Origen to be
discrepant and contradictory to one another. The cause of these variations I have set forth
very fully for your information in the Apology which Pamphilus wrote for the books of
Origen, to which I have appended a very short treatise2806 showing by proofs which seem
to me quite clear that his books have been in very many cases falsified by heretical and illdisposed
persons. This is especially the case with the books which you now require me to
translate, namely, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, which may be rendered either Concerning First Principles
or Concerning Principalities. These books are in truth, apart from these questions, exceedingly
obscure and difficult; for in them he discusses matters over which the philosophers
have spent their whole lives without any result. But our Christian thinker has done all that
lay in his power to turn to purposes of sound religion the belief in a creator and the order
of the created world which they had made subservient to their false religion. Wherever
therefore I have found in his books anything contrary to the truth concerning the Trinity
which he has in other places spoken of in a strictly orthodox sense, I have either omitted it
as a foreign and not genuine expression or set it down in terms agreeing with the rule of
faith which we find him constantly assenting to. There are things, no doubt, which he has
developed in somewhat obscure language, wishing to pass rapidly over them, and as addressing
those who have experience and knowledge of such matters; in these cases I have made
the passage plain by adding words which I had read in other books of his where the matter
was more fully treated. I have done this in the interest of clearness: but I have put in nothing
of my own; I have only given him back his own words, though taken from other passages.
<note type="footnote">2806 See the Translation in this Volume.</note>

<pb n="1106"/>
I have explained this in the Preface, so that those who calumniate us should not think that
they had found in this fresh material for their charges. But let them take heed what they are
about in their perversity and contentiousness. As for me, I have not undertaken this laborious
task (in which I trust that God will be my helper in answer to your prayers) for the sake of
shutting the mouths of calumnious men, but with the view of supplying material for the
increase of real knowledge to those who desired it. This only I require of every man who
undertakes to copy out these books or to read them, in the sight of God the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, and adjure him by our faith in the coming kingdom, by the assurance
of the resurrection of the dead, by the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his
angels (even as he trusts that he shall not possess as his eternal inheritance that place where
there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and where their fire will not be quenched and their
worm will not die) that he should neither add nor take away, that he should neither insert
nor change, anything in that which is written but that he should compare his copy with that
from which it is copied and correct it critically letter for letter, and that he should not keep
by him a copy which has not received correction or criticism, lest, if his copy is not thus
distinct, the difficulty of the meaning may beget a still greater obscurity in the mind of the
readers.</p>

<head>Preface to Book III. of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</head>
<p>Rufinus had now come to Rome. The translation of B. III. and IV. had been made
probably at Pinetum early in 398. He was already aware of the strong feelings aroused by
his Translation of B. I. and II., and he complains that parts of his work were obtained by
Jerome’s friends while still uncorrected, and used to his discredit (Apol. i, 18–21, ii, 44); but
he continued the work, prefixing to it the following Preface as his justification.</p>
<p>Reader, remember me in your sacred moments of prayer, that I may be a worthy follower
of the Spirit. It was you, Macarius, by whose instigation, I might say by whose compulsion,
I translated the two first books of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. I did it during Lent; and at that time
your near presence, my Christian brother, and your fuller leisure, forced me also into fuller
diligence. But now that you are living at the opposite end of Rome from me, and my taskmaster
pays his visits more seldom, I have taken longer in unfolding the sense of the two
last books. You will remember that in my former preface I gave you warning that some
people would be full of indignation when they found that I had no harm to say of Origen:
and this, as I think you have found, has not been long in coming to pass. But if those demons
who excite men’s tongues to evil speaking, have been already set on fire by that first part of
the work, though in it the author had not yet fully laid bare their devices, what will be the
effect of this second part, in which he is going to disclose all the secret labyrinths through
which they creep into the hearts of men and deceive the hearts of the weak and the frail?
You will see disorder springing up on all sides, and party spirit will be raised, and an outcry
will spread all through the town, and Origen will be summoned to the bar and condemned
for his attempt to dispel the darkness of ignorance by the light of the Gospel’s lamp. But all
this will matter very little to those who are endeavouring to hold fast the sound form of the
catholic faith while exercising their minds in the study of divine things.</p>
<p>I think it necessary, however, to remind you of the principle which I acted upon in reference
to the former books, and which I have observed in the present case also, namely, not
to set down in my translation things evidently contradictory to our belief and to the author’s
opinions as elsewhere expressed, but to pass them over as not genuine but inserted by others.
On the other hand I have not, either in the former books or in these, omitted the novel
opinions which he has expressed about the formation of the reasonable creation, considering
that it is not in such things that the faith mainly consists, but that what he is aiming at is
merely knowledge and the exercise of the faculties, and that possibly there may be certain
heresies which may have to be answered in this way. Only, in cases where he may have
chosen to repeat in these later books what he had said before in the earlier, I have thought
it expedient to cut out certain portions for the sake of brevity.</p>

<pb n="1108"/>
<p>Those whose object in reading these books is to gain knowledge, not to disparage their
author, would do well to seek the aid of men more skilled than themselves in interpreting
them. For it is an absurd thing to get grammarians to explain to us the fictions of the poets’
writings and the laughable stories of the comedians, and yet to think that books which speak
of God and the celestial powers, and the whole universe, and which discuss all the errors of
pagan philosophy and of heretical pravity are things which any one can understand without
a teacher to explain them. In this way it comes to pass that men prefer to remain in ignorance
and to pronounce rash judgments on things which are difficult and obscure rather than to
gain an understanding of them by diligent study.</p>

<head>Rufinus’ Apology in Defence of Himself.</head>
<head>Sent to Anastasius, Bishop of the City of Rome.</head>
<p>This document was called forth by accusations against Rufinus made, soon after his
accession, to Anastasius, who held the Roman see from 498 to 503. The authority of the
Roman Popes at this time was not what it afterwards became, and it is improbable that
Anastasius should have summoned Rufinus, as some suppose him to have done, from
Aquileia, where he was living on confidential terms with the Bishop Chromatius, to come
to Rome to answer a formal accusation or to be judged by him. But since Rome was the
centre of information, a Christian would not wish to be ill-thought of by its Bishop. Those
who accused Rufinus were the friends of Jerome at Rome, especially the noble widow Marcella
and the Senator Pammachius. They had endeavoured to gain some condemnation of Rufinus
from Siricius before his death in November 398; but Siricius befriended Rufinus (“his simplicity
was imposed on,” according to Jerome).2807 On the election of Anastasius, however,
in 399, they accused Rufinus of having, by his translation of Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν introduced
heresy into the Roman church. Jerome thus speaks of Marcella, Ep. cxxvii. 10. “She was the
cause of the condemnation of the heretics: she brought witnesses who had been at a former
time under their instruction, and thus imbued with error and heresy; she showed how many
there were who had been deceived; she had the volumes of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν brought in, and
pointed out the alterations which the Scorpion2808 had made in them: till at last letters were
written, and that more than once, summoning the heretics to come and defend themselves,
but they did not dare to come. So great was the force of conviction brought to bear on them
that, to prevent their heresy being exposed in their presence, they chose to stay away and
be condemned.” From the letter of Anastasius to John of Jerusalem about Rufinus we
gather that, while he strongly disapproved the translation of Origen, he left Rufinus himself
to his own conscience, and did not care to know what had become of him. The letter of
Rufinus, though called an Apology, bears no trace of being an answer to a summons or
judgment of the Pontiff, but merely a reply to statements which were likely to prejudice him
in the Pontiff’s opinion. The year in which the Apology was written was 400 a.d.</p>

<p>1. It has been brought to my knowledge that certain persons, in the course of a controversy
which they have been raising in your Holiness’ jurisdiction on matters of faith or on
other points, have made mention of my name. I venture to believe that your Holiness, who
have been trained from your infancy in the strict principles of the Church, has refused to
listen to any calumnies which may have been directed against an absent person, and one
who has been favourably known to you as united with you in the faith and love of God.
Nevertheless, since I hear it reported that my reputation has been attacked, I have thought
it right to make my position clear to your Holiness in writing. It was impossible for me to
do this in person. I have just returned to my family2809 after an absence of nearly 30 years;
and it would have been harsh and almost inhuman to come away again so soon from those
whom I had been so late in revisiting. The labour also of my long journey has left me too
weak to begin the journey again. My object in this letter is not to remove some stain of
suspicion from your mind, which I regard as a holy place, as a kind of divine sanctuary
which does not admit any evil thing. Rather, I desire that the confession I am about to make
to you may be like a stick placed in your hands to drive away any envious persons who may
be barking like dogs against me.</p>
<p>2. My faith, indeed, was sufficiently proved when the heretics persecuted me. I was at
that time sojourning in the church of Alexandria, and underwent imprisonment and exile
which was then the penalty of faithfulness; yet for the sake of any who may wish to put my
faith to the test, or to hear and learn what it is I will declare it. I believe that the Trinity is
of one nature and godhead, of one and the same power and substance; so that between the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost there is no diversity at all, except that the one is the
Father, the second the Son, and the third the Holy Ghost. There is a Trinity of real and living
Persons, a unity of nature and substance.</p>
<p>3. I also confess that the Son of God has in these last days been born of the Virgin and
the Holy Spirit: that he has taken upon him our natural human flesh and soul; that in this
he suffered and was buried and rose again from the dead; that the flesh in which he rose
was that same flesh which had been laid in the sepulchre; and that in this same flesh, together
with the soul, he ascended into heaven after his resurrection: from whence we look for his
coming to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>4. But, further, as to the resurrection of our own flesh, I believe that it will be in its integrity
and perfection; it will be this very flesh in which we now live. We do not hold, as is
slanderously reported by some men, that another flesh will rise instead of this; but this very
flesh, without the loss of a single member, without the cutting off of any single part of the
<note type="footnote">2809 Rufinus uses the word “parentes.” Jerome in his Apology (ii, 2) scoffs at the notion that a man of Rufinus’
age (about 55) could have parents living, and supposes that he is making a false suggestion by using the word
in the sense in which it was vulgarly used—that of relations generally, as it is now used in French.</note>

<pb n="1111"/>
body; none whatever of all its properties will be absent except its corruptibility. It is this
which is promised by the holy Apostle concerning the body: It is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in dishonour,
it is raised in glory; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. This is the doctrine
which has been handed down to me by those from whom I received holy baptism in the
Church of Aquileia; and I think that it is the same which the Apostolic See has by long usage
handed down and taught.</p>
<p>5. I affirm, moreover, a judgment to come, in which judgment every man is to receive
the due meed of his bodily life, according to that which he has done, whether good or evil.
And, if in the case of men the reward is to be according to their works, how much more will
this be so in the case of the devil, who is the universal cause of sin? Of the devil himself our
belief is that which is written in the Gospel, namely, that both he and all his angels, will receive
as their portion the eternal fire, and with him those who do his works, that is, who become
the accusers of their brethren. If then any one denies that the devil is to be subjected to the
eternal fires, may he have his part with him in the eternal fire, so that he may know by experience
the fact which he now denies.</p>
<p>6. I am next informed that some stir has been made on the question of the nature of the
soul. Whether complaints on a matter of this kind ought to be entertained instead of being
put aside, you must yourself decide. If, however, you desire to know my opinion on the
subject, I will state it frankly. I have read a great many writers on this question, and I find
that they express divers opinions. Some of those whom I have read hold that the soul is infused
together with the material body through the channel2810 of the human seed; and of
this they give such proofs as they can. I think that this was the opinion of Tertullian or
Lactantius among the Latins, perhaps also of a few others. Others assert that God is every
day making new souls, and infusing them into the bodies which have been framed in the
womb; while others again believe that the souls were all made long ago, when God made all
things of nothing, and that all that he now does is to plant out each soul in its body as it
seems good to him. This is the opinion of Origen, and of some others of the Greeks. For
myself, I declare in the presence of God that, after reading each of these opinions, I am up
to the present moment unable to hold any of them as certain and absolute; the determination
of the truth in this question I leave to God and to any to whom it shall please him to reveal
it. My profession on this point is therefore, first, that these several opinions are those which
I have found in books, but, secondly, that I as yet remain in ignorance on the subject, except
<note type="footnote">2810 Traducem, properly, the layer, by which the vine is propagated, and hence the medium through which
life is communicated. This is the theory of the “traducianists” who thus made the soul to be derived from the
parent by procreation. It is contrasted with that of the “creationists” who held that each soul was separately
created, and infused into the child at the moment when life began.</note>

<pb n="1112"/>
so far as this, that the Church delivers it as an article of faith that God is the creator of souls
as well as of bodies.</p>
<p>7. Now as to another matter. I am told that objections have been raised against me because,
forsooth, at the request of some of my brethren, I translated certain works of Origen
from Greek into Latin. I suppose that every one sees that it is only through ill will that this
is made a matter of blame. For, if there is any offensive statement in the author, why is this
to be twisted into a fault of the translator? I was asked to exhibit in Latin what stands written
in the Greek text; and I did nothing more than fit the Latin words to the Greek ideas. If,
therefore, there is anything to praise in these ideas, the praise does not belong to me; and
similarly as to anything to which blame may attach. I admit that I put something of my own
into the work; as I stated in my Preface, I used my own discretion in cutting out not a few
passages; but only those as to which I had come to suspect that the thing had not been so
stated by Origen himself; and the statement appeared to me in these cases to have been in-
serted by others, because in other places I had found the author state the matter in a catholic
sense. I entreat you therefore, holy, venerable and saintly father, not to permit a storm of
ill will to be raised against me because of this, nor to sanction the employment of partisanship
and of calumny—weapons which ought never to be used in the Church of God. Where can
simple faith and innocence be safe if they are not protected in the Church? I am not a defender
or a champion of Origen; nor am I the first who has translated his works. Others
before me had done the very same thing, and I did it, the last of many, at the request of my
brethren. If an order is to be given that such translations are not to be made, such an order
holds good for the future, not the past; but if those are to be blamed who have made these
translations before any such order was given, the blame must begin with those who took
the first step.</p>
<p>8. As for me, I declare in Christ’s name that I never held, nor ever will hold, any other
faith but that which I have set forth above, that is, the faith which is held by the Church of
Rome, by that of Alexandria, and by my own church of Aquileia; and which is also preached
at Jerusalem; and if there is any one who believes otherwise, whoever he may be, let him be
Anathema. But those who through mere ill will and malice engender dissensions and offences
among their brethren, and cause them to stumble, shall give account of it in the day of
judgment.</p>

<head>The Letter of Anastasius,</head>
<head>Bishop of the Church of Rome to John Bishop of Jerusalem Concerning the
Character of Rufinus.</head>
<p>The letter of Anastasius to John of Jerusalem was written in the year 401; it is spoken
of in Jerome’s Apol. iii., c. 21, which was written in the first half of 402, as “the letter of last
year.” Jerome intimates in the same passage that it was only one of several letters of the same
character which Anastasius wrote to the East. Rufinus had not seen it, and refused to believe
its genuineness. But there seems to be no reason for doubting this. Anastasius had, at the
earnest request of Theophilus of Alexandria, formally condemned Origenism. And Rufinus’
translations of Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν and of Pamphilus’ Vindication of Origen, and his own
book on the Falsification of Origen’s works were taken at Rome as a defence of Origenism
generally. Rufinus, however, appealed continually, and especially in his Apology to Anastasius,
to the church of Jerusalem, where he had been ordained. “My faith,” he says, “is that
which is preached at Jerusalem.” Anastasius, therefore, in condemning Origen would be
understood as condemning Rufinus, and might also seem to condemn his Bishop John of
Jerusalem. This will account for the fulsome praises with which the letter opens. John,
moreover, had written “to consult” Anastasius about Rufinus, which probably implies some
action in Rufinus’ interest; but the fact that Jerome knew the contents of the letter and
Rufinus did not seems to show that Bishop John had become more friendly with Jerome
and less so with Rufinus.</p>
<p>1. The kind words of approval that you have addressed, my dear Bishop, to your
brother Bishop, is a fresh mark of your long tried affection. It is a high commendation which
you confer upon me, a most lavish recognition of my services. I thank you for this proof of
your love; and, following you at a distance in my littleness, I bring the tribute of my words
to honour the splendour of your holiness and those virtues which the Lord has conferred
upon you. You excel all others so far, the splendour of your praise shines forth so conspicuously,
that no words which I can use can equal your deserts. Yet your glory excites in me
such admiration that I cannot turn away from the attempt to describe it, even though I can
never do so adequately. And, first, the praise which you have bestowed on me out of the
serene heaven of your great spirit forms part of your own glory: for it is the majesty of your
episcopate, shining forth like the sun upon the opposite quarter of the world, which has reflected
its own brightness upon us. And you give me your friendship unreservedly; you do
not weigh me in the balance of criticism. If it is right for you to praise me, must not your
praise be echoed back to you? I beg you therefore, for your own sake no less than mine, that
you will not praise me any more to my face. I ask this for two reasons: if the praise is un-

<pb n="1114"/>
deserved it must excite in your brother-bishop a sense of pain; if it is true, it must make him
blush.</p>
<p>2. Let me come to the subject of your letter. Rufinus, about whom you have done me
the honour to ask my advice, must bring his conscience to the bar of the divine majesty. It
is for him to see how he can approve himself to God as maintaining his true allegiance to
him.</p>
<p>3. As for Origen, whose writings he has translated into our language, I have neither
formerly known, nor do I now seek to know either who he was or what expression he may
have given to his thought. But as to the feeling left by this matter on my own mind I should
be glad to speak with your holiness for a moment. The impression which I have received is
this,—and it has been brought out clearly by the reading of parts of Origen’s works by the
people of our City, and by the sort of mist of blindness which it threw over them,—that his
object was to disintegrate our faith, which is that of the Apostles, and has been confirmed
by the traditions of the fathers, by leading us into tortuous paths.</p>
<p>4. I want to know what is the meaning of the translation of this work into the Roman
tongue. If the translator intends by it to put the author in the wrong, and to denounce to
the world his execrable deeds, well and good. In that case he will expose to well-merited
hatred one who has long laboured under the adverse weight of public opinion. But if by
translating all these evil things he means to give his assent to them, and in that sense gives
them to the world to read, then the edifice which he has reared at the expense of so much
labour serves for nothing else than to make the guilt the act of his own will, and to give the
sanction of his unlooked for support to the overthrow of all that is of prime importance in
the true faith as held by Catholic Christians from the time of the Apostles till now.</p>
<p>5. Far be such teaching from the catholic system of the Church of Rome. It can never
by any possibility come to pass that we should accept as reasonable things which we condemn
as matters of law and right. We have, therefore, the assurance that Christ our God, whose
providence reaches over the whole world, bestows his approval on us when we say that it is
wholly impossible for us to admit doctrines which defile the church, which subvert its well
tried moral system, which offend the ears of all who are witnesses of our doings and lay the
ground for strife and anger and dissensions. This was the motive which led me to write my
letter to Venerius2811 our brother in the Episcopate, the character of which, written as it
was in my weakness but with great care and diligence, you will realize by what I now subjoin:
“Whence, then, he who translated the work has gained and preserves this assurance of innocence
I am not greatly troubled to know: it fills me with no vain alarm. I certainly shall omit
nothing which may enable me to guard the faith of the Gospel amongst my own people,
and to warn, as far as in me lies, those who form part of my body, in whatever part of the
<note type="footnote">2811 Appointed bishop of Milan in 400, in succession to Simplicianus.</note>

<pb n="1115"/>
world they live, not to allow any translation of profane authors to creep in and spring up
amongst them, which will seek to unsettle the mind of devout men by spreading its own
darkness among them. Moreover, I cannot pass over in silence an event which has given
me great pleasure, the decree issued by our Emperors,2812 by which every one who serves
God is warned against the reading of Origen, and all who are convicted of reading his impious
works are condemned by the imperial judgment.” In these words my formal sentence was
pronounced.</p>
<p>6. You are troubled by the complaint which people make as to our treatment of Rufinus,
so that you pursue certain persons2813 with vague suspicions. But I will meet this feeling of
yours with an instance taken from holy writ, namely, where it is said: “Man seeth not as
God seeth; for God looketh upon the heart, but man upon the countenance.” Therefore, my
dearly beloved brother, put away all your prejudice. Weigh the conduct of Rufinus in your
own unbiassed judgment; ask yourself whether he has not translated Origen’s words into
Latin and approved them, and whether a man who gives his encouragement to vicious acts
committed by another differs at all from the guilty party. In any case I beg you to be assured
of this, that he is so completely separate from all part or lot with us, that I neither know nor
wish to know either what he is doing or where he is living. I have only to add that it is for
him to consider where he may obtain absolution.</p>

<head>The Apology of Rufinus.</head>
<head>Addressed to Apronianus, in Reply to Jerome’s Letter to Pammachius,2814
Written at Aquileia a.d. 400.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<head>In Two Books.</head>
<p>In order to understand the controversy between Jerome and Rufinus it is necessary to
look back over their earlier relations. They had been close friends in early youth (Jerome,
Ep. iii, 3, v, 2.) and had together formed part of a society of young Christian ascetics at
Aquileia in the years 370–3. Jerome’s letter (3) to Rufinus in 374 is full of affection; in 381
he was placed in Jerome’s Chronicle (year 378) as “a monk of great renown,” and when after
some years, they were neighbours in Palestine, Rufinus with Melania on the Mt. of Olives,
Jerome with Paula at Bethlehem, they remained friends. (Ruf. Apol. ii. 8 (2).) In the disputes
about Origenism which arose from the visits of Aterbius (Jer. Apol. iii, 33) and Epiphanius
(Jerome Against John of Jerusalem, 11), they became estranged, Jerome siding with Epiphanius
and Rufinus with John (Jer Letter li, 6. Against John of Jerusalem II). They were
reconciled before Rufinus left Palestine in 397 (Jer. Apol. i, 1, iii, 33). But when Rufinus
came to Italy and at the request of Macarius2815 translated Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, the Preface
which he prefixed to this work was the occasion for a fresh and final outbreak of dissension.
The friends of Jerome of whom Pammachius, Oceanus and Marcella were the most prominent,
were scandalized at some of the statements of the book, and still more at the assumption
made by Rufinus that Jerome, by his previous translations of some of Origen’s works,
had proved himself his admirer. They also suspected that Rufinus’ translation had made
Origen speak in an orthodox sense which was not genuine and that heterodox statements
had been suppressed. They therefore wrote to Jerome at Bethlehem a letter (translated among
Jerome’s letters in this Series No. lxxxiii) begging for information on all these points. Jerome
in reply made a literal translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, and sent it accompanied by a letter
(lxxxiv) in which he declared that he had never been a partisan of Origen’s dogmatic system,
though he admired him as a commentator. He fastened on some of the most questionable
of Origen’s speculations, his doctrine of the resurrection, of the previous existence of souls
and their fall into human bodies, and the ultimate restoration of all spiritual beings; his
permission, in agreement with Plato, of the use of falsehood in certain cases; and some ex-
<note type="footnote">2814 Ep. 84.</note>
<note type="footnote">2815 See the Translation of Rufinus’ Prefaces given above, and the notes prefixed to them.</note>

<pb n="1117"/>
pressions about the relation of the Persons of the Godhead which, at least to Western ears,
seemed a denial of their equality. He appealed to his own commentaries on Ecclesiastes and
on the Ephesians to show that he rejected these doctrines; and he urged that, even if he had
once had too indiscriminate an admiration of Origen, he had in later years judged more
clearly.</p>
<p>In the main Jerome’s defence was valid. But it demanded considerateness in his judges;
and this quality was absent in himself. He judged Origen’s opinions harshly, and spoke of
his views as poisonous (Letter lxxxiv, 3); and, when we contrast the lenity of his former
judgments on the same points with his present violence, it becomes evident that he was
more concerned for his own reputation than for truth. Rufinus charges him (Apol. i. c. 23
to 44) with maintaining, in his Commentaries on the Ephesians (written twelve years earlier
in 388) to which Jerome had appealed (Ep. lxxxiv, 2) the views which he now denounced;
and the charge, though urged too far, is substantially made out. The opinions of Origen
which he introduced into this Commentary about the fall of souls out of a previous state of
bliss into human bodies are set down with hardly a word of objection (comm. on ch. i, v.
4), and his speculations on the Powers and Principalities of the world to come (ib. v. 21)
and on the rise of Lucifer and his angels to be subjects of Christ’s Kingdom (id. ii, 7) and
their part in the final restoration of all things (id. iv, 16) are adopted as his own, thus giving
some justification for Rufinus’ attack (Apol. i, 34–36. U+0026c.). His defence of himself therefore
is hardly candid. And his allusions to his opponent are exasperating, e.g. when he speaks
(Letter lxxxiv, 1) of some persons “who love me so well that they cannot be heretics without
me.” “I wonder that, while they speak in detraction of the flesh, they live carnally and thus
cherish and nourish delicately their enemy” (Id. 8). He hardly argues fairly as to Rufinus’
assertion that Origen’s works had suffered from falsification: and he is carried so far by his
animosity that he denies the Apology of Pamphilus for Origen to be by Pamphilus, though
he had himself attributed it to him (De Vir. Ill. c. 7. 5) and no one can doubt that it is his.
(See Dict. of Christ. Biog. Art. Pamphilus.)</p>
<p>But though writing thus for his friends generally, Jerome wrote at the same time a
friendly letter to Rufinus himself in answer, it would seem, to one from him, (Letter lxxxi.)
in which he speaks of their common friends, and of the death of Rufinus’ mother, and says
that he has charged a friend whom he is sending to Italy to visit Rufinus and assure him of
his high esteem; and, while remonstrating with him for his Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν,
merely says “I have begged my other friends to avoid a quarrel. I count on your sense of
equity not to give occasion to impatient persons; for you will not find every one, like me,
able to take pleasure in praises framed to suit a purpose.”2816</p>

<p>Had this letter reached Rufinus, the ensuing controversy would have been avoided. But
it never reached him. It was sent through Pammachius, and he and Jerome’s other friends
kept it back, while they published the letter sent them with Jerome’s translation of the Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν. Rufinus who was now at Aquileia, having left Rome probably early in 399 wrote
the Apology, addressing it to his friend and convert Apronianus at Rome.</p>

<p>I have read the document sent from the East by our friend and good brother to a distinguished
member of the Senate, Pammachius, which you have copied and forwarded to me.
It brought to my mind the words of the Prophet:2817 “The sons of men whose teeth are
spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.” But for these wounds which men inflict
on one another with the tongue we can hardly find a physician; so I have betaken myself to
Jesus, the heavenly physician, and he has brought out for me from the medicine chest of
the Gospel an antidote of sovereign power; he has assuaged the violence of my grief with
the assurance of the righteous judgment which I shall have at his hands. The potion which
our Lord dispensed to me was nothing else than these words:2818 “Blessed are ye when men
persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely. Rejoice and leap for joy, for
great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.”
With this medicine I was content, and, as far as the matter concerned me, I had determined
for the future to keep silence; for I said within myself,2819 “If they have called the Master of
the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household?” (that is, you and me, unworthy
though we are). And, if it was said of him,2820 “He is a deceiver, he deceiveth the people,”
I must not be indignant if I hear that I am called a heretic, and that the name of mole is applied
to me because of the slowness of my mind, or indeed my blindness. Christ who is my
Lord, aye, and who is God over all, was called2821 “a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners.” How can I, then, be angry when I am called a carnal man2822
who lives in luxury?</p>

<p>2. Nevertheless, a necessity, as it were, is laid upon me to reply, as a simple matter of
justice: I mean, because many, as I hear, are likely to be upset by what he has written unless
the true state of the case is laid before them. I am compelled, against my resolution and even
my vows, to make reply, lest by keeping silence I should seem to acknowledge the accusation
to be true. It is, indeed, in most cases, a Christian’s glory to follow our Lord’s example of
silence, and thereby to repel the accusation; but to follow this course in matters of faith
causes stumbling blocks to spring up in vast numbers. It is true that, in the beginning of his
invective he promises that he will avoid personalities, and reply only about the things in
question and the charges made against him; but his profession in both cases is false; for how
can he answer a charge when no charge has been made? and how can a man be said to avoid
personalities when he never ceases to attack and tear to pieces the translator of the books
in question from the first line to the last of his invective? I shall avoid all pretence of saying
less than I mean, and similar subterfuges of hypocrisy which are hateful in God’s sight; and,
though my words may be uncouth and my style unadorned, I will make my reply. I trust,
and I shall not trust in vain, that my readers will pardon my lack of skill, since my object is
not to amuse others but to endeavour to clear myself from the reproaches directed against
me. My wish is that what may shine forth in me may not be style but truth.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<p>3. But, before I begin to clear up these points, there is one in which I confess that he has
spoken the truth in an eminent degree; namely, when he says that he is not rendering evil
speaking for evil speaking. This, I say, is quite true; for it is not for evil speaking but for
speaking well of him and praising him that he has rendered reproach and evil speaking. But
it is not true, as he says, that he turns the left cheek to one who smites him on the right. It
is on one who is stroking him and caressing him on the cheek that he suddenly turns and
bites him. I praised his eloquence and his industry in the work of translating from the Greek.
I said nothing in derogation of his faith; but he condemns me on both these points. He must
therefore pardon me if I say some things rather roughly and rudely; for he has challenged
to a reply a man who has no great rhetorical skill, and who has not, as he knows, the power
to make one whom he wishes to injure and to wound appear to have received neither wounds
nor injuries. Those who love this kind of eloquence must seek it in a man whom every light
report stirs up to fault-finding and vituperation, and who thinks himself bound, as if he
were the censor, to be always coming up to set things to rights. A man who desires to clear
himself from the stains which have been cast upon him, does not trouble himself, in the
answer which he is compelled to make, about the elegance and neat turns of his reply, but
only about its truth.</p>

<p>4. At the very beginning of his work he says, “As if they could not be heretics by themselves,
without me.” I must first show that, whether with him or without him, we are no
heretics: then, when our status is made clear, we shall be safe from having the infamous
imputation hurled at us from other men’s reports. I was already living in a monastery, where,
as both he and all others know, about 30 years ago, I was made regenerate by Baptism, and
received the seal of the faith at the hands of those saintly men, Chromatius,2823 Jovinus2824
and Eusebius,2825 all of them now bishops, well-tried and highly esteemed in the church of
God, one of whom was then a presbyter of the church under Valerian of blessed memory,
the second was archdeacon, the third Deacon, and to me a spiritual father, my teacher in
the creed and the articles of belief. These men so taught me, and so I believe, namely, that
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are of one Godhead, of one Substance: a Trinity coeternal,
inseparable, incorporeal, invisible, incomprehensible, known to itself alone as it
truly is in its perfection: For “No man2826 knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth
any man the Father but the Son”: and the Holy Spirit is he who “searcheth2827 the deep
things of God”: that this Trinity, therefore, is without all bodily visibility, but that it is with
the eye of the understanding that the Son and the Holy Spirit see the Father even as the
Father sees the Son and the Holy Spirit; and further, that in this Trinity there is no diversity
except that one is Father, another Son and a third Holy Spirit. There is a Trinity as touching
the distinction of persons, a unity in the reality of the Substance. We received, further, that
the only begotten Son of God, through whom in the beginning all existing things were made,
whether visible or invisible, in these last days took upon him a human body and Soul, and
was made man, and suffered for our salvation; and the third day he rose again from the dead
in that very flesh which had been laid in the sepulchre; and in that very same flesh made
glorious he ascended into the heavens, whence we look for his coming to judge the quick
and the dead. But further we confess that he gave us hope that we too should rise in a similar
manner, so that we believe that our resurrection will be in the same manner and process,
and in the same form, as the resurrection of our Lord himself from the dead: that the bodies
which we shall receive will not be phantoms or thin vapours, as some slanderously affirm
that we say, but these very bodies of ours in which we live and in which we die. For how can
we truly believe in the resurrection of the flesh, unless the very nature of flesh remains in it

<p>5. Moreover, to give a fuller demonstration of this point, I will add one thing more. It
is the compulsion of those who calumniate me which forces me to exhibit a singular and
special mystery of my own church. It is this, that, while all the churches thus hand down
the Sacrament of the Creed in the form which, after the words “the remission of sins” adds
“the resurrection of the flesh,” the holy church of Aquileia (as though the Spirit of God had
foreseen the calumnies which would be spoken against us) puts in a particular pronoun at
the place where it delivers the resurrection of the dead; instead of saying as others do, “the
resurrection of the flesh,” we say “the resurrection of this flesh.” At this point, as the custom
is at the close of the Creed, we touch the forehead of this flesh with the sign of the cross,
and with the mouth of this flesh, which we have so touched, we confess the resurrection;
that so we may stop up every entrance through which the poisoned tongue might bring in
its calumnies against us. Can any confession be fuller than this? Can any exposition of the
truth be more perfect? Yet I see that this remarkable provision of the Holy Spirit has been
of no profit to us. Evil and busy tongues still find room for cavilling. Unless, says he, you
name the members one by one, and expressly designate the head with its hair, the hands,
the feet, the belly, and that which is below the belly, you have denied the resurrection of the
flesh.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="1127"/>
<p>6. Behold the discovery of this man of the new learning! a thing which escaped the notice
of the Apostles when they delivered the faith to the Church; a thing which none of the saints
knew till it was revealed to this man by the spirit of the flesh. He indeed cannot expound it
without bringing in an indecency. Nevertheless, I will set it forth in his hearing both more
worthily and more truly. Christ is the first fruits of those that sleep;2828 he is also called2829
the first begotten from the dead; as also the Apostle says,2830 “Christ is the beginning, afterward
they that are Christ’s.” Since then we have Christ as the undoubted first fruits of our
resurrection, how can any question arise about the rest of us? It must be evident that,
whatever the members, the hair, the flesh, the bones, were in which Christ rose, in the same
shall we also rise. For this purpose he offered himself to the disciples to touch after his resurrection,
so that no hesitation as to his resurrection should remain. Since then Christ has
given his own resurrection as a typical instance, one that is quite evident, and (as I may say)
capable of being felt and handled by the hand, who can be so mad as to think that he himself
will rise otherwise than as He rose who opened the door of the resurrection? This also confirms
the truth of this confession of ours that, while it is the actual natural flesh and no
other which will rise, yet it will rise purged from its faults and having laid aside its corruption;
so that the saying of the Apostle is true:2831 “It is sown in corruption, it will be raised in incorruption;
it is sown in dishonour, it will be raised in glory; it is sown a natural2832 body,
it will be raised a spiritual body.” Inasmuch then as it is a spiritual body, and glorious, and
incorruptible, it will be furnished and adorned with its own proper members, not with
members taken from elsewhere, according to that glorious image of which Christ is set forth
as the perpetual type, as it is said by the Apostle:2833 “Who shall change the body of our
humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory.”</p>

<p>7. Since then, in reference to our hope of the resurrection, Christ is set forth all through
as the archetype, since he is the first born of those who rise, and since he is the head of every
creature, as it is written,2834 “Who is the head of all, the first born from the dead, that in all
things he might have the preeminence;” how is it that we stir up these vain strifes of words,
and conflicts of evil surmises? Does not the faith of the church consist in the confession
which I have set forth above? And is it not evident that men are moved to accuse others not
by difference of belief, but by perversity of disposition? At this point, however, in arguing
about the resurrection of the flesh, our friend, as his habit is, mixes up what is ridiculous
and farcical with what is serious. He says:</p>
<p>“Some poor creatures of the female sex among us are fond of asking what good the resurrection
will be to them? They touch their breasts, and stroke their beardless faces, and
strike their thighs and their bellies, and ask whether this poor weak body is to rise again.
No, they say, if we are to be like angels we shall have the nature of angels.”</p>
<p>Who the poor women are whom he thus takes to task, and whether they are deserving
of his attacks, he knows best. And if he considers himself to be one of those who are bound
to preach that it is not our part to attack another out of revenge, but that in this instance he
is right in attacking others when they have given him no cause for revenge; or if, again, he
considers that it is no business of his to take care that weak women of his company should
be subjected to attacks only for real causes, and not for such false and fictitious reasons as
these—of all this, I say, he is himself the best judge. For us it is sufficient to act as he said
that he would act: we shall not render evil for evil. But it is evident that the man who is angry
with a woman because she says that she hopes not to have a frail body in the resurrection
is of the opinion that the frailties of the body will remain. Only, what then, we ask, are we
to make of the words of the Apostle: “It is sown in weakness, it will be raised in power; it is
sown a natural body, it will be raised a spiritual body”? What frailty can you suppose to exist
in a spiritual body? It is to rise in power; how then is it again to be frail? If it is frail, how
can it be in power? Are not those poor women after all more right than you, when they say
that their bodily frailty cannot have dominion over them in the world beyond? Why should
you mock at them, when they are only following the Apostle’s words: “This corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality?” The Apostles never taught
that the body which would rise from the dead would be frail, but, on the contrary, that it
would rise in power and in glory. Whence comes this opinion which you now produce?
Perhaps it is one obtained from some of your Jews,2835 which is now to be promulgated as
a new law for the church, so that we may learn their ways: for in truth the Jews have such

<note type="footnote">2835 Rufinus frequently taunts Jerome with having paid too much heed to the Jewish teachers from whom

<pb n="1129"/>
an opinion as this about the resurrection; they believe that they will rise, but in such sort as
that they will enjoy all carnal delights and luxuries, and other pleasures of the body. What
else, indeed, can this “bodily frailty” of yours mean except members given over to corruption,
appetites stimulated and lusts inflamed?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
<pb n="1130"/>
<p>8. But suffer it to be so, I beg you, as you are lovers of Christ, that the body is to be in
incorruption and without these conditions when it rises from the dead: then let such things
henceforward cease to be mentioned. Let us believe that in the resurrection even lawful intercourse
will no longer exist between the sexes, since there would be danger that unlawful
intercourse would creep in if such things remained present and unforgotten. What is the
use of carefully and minutely going over and discussing “the belly and what is below it?”
You tell us that we live amidst carnal delights: but I perceive that it is your belief that we are
not to give up such things even in the resurrection. Let us not deny that this very flesh in
which we now live is to rise again: but neither let us make men think that the imperfections
of the flesh are wrapped up in it and will come again with it. The flesh, indeed, will rise, this
very flesh and not another: it will not change its nature, but it will lose its frailties and imperfections.
Otherwise, if its frailties remain, it cannot even be immortal. And thus, as I said,
we avoid heresy, whether with you or without you. For the faith of the Church, of which we
are the disciples, takes a middle path between two dangers: it does not deny the reality of
the natural flesh and body when it rises from the dead, but neither does it assert, in contradiction
to the Apostle’s words,2836 that in the kingdom which is to come corruption will
inherit incorruption. We therefore do not assert that the flesh or body will rise, as you put
it, with some of its members lost or amputated, but that the body will be whole and complete,
having laid aside nothing but its corruption and dishonour and frailty and also having amputated
all the imperfections of mortality: nothing of its own nature will be lacking to that
spiritual body which shall rise from the dead except this corruption.</p>

<p>9. I have made answer more at length than I had intended on this single article of the
resurrection, through fear lest by brevity I should lay myself open to fresh aspersions. Consequently,
I have made mention again and again not only of the body. as to which cavils are
raised, but of the flesh: and not only of the flesh; I have added “this flesh;” and further I have
spoken not only of “this flesh” but of “this natural flesh;” I have not even stopped here, but
have asserted that not even the completeness of the several members would be lacking. I
have only demanded that it should be held as part of the faith that, according to the words
of the Apostle, it should rise incorruptible instead of corruptible, glorious in stead of dishonoured,
immortal instead of frail, spiritual instead of natural; and that we should think of the
members of the spiritual body as being without taint of corruption or of frailty. I have set
forth my faith in reference to the Trinity, the Incarnation of the Lord our Saviour, to his
Passion and Resurrection, his second coming and the judgment to come. I have also set it
forth in the matter of the resurrection of our flesh, and have left nothing, I think, in ambiguity.
Nothing in my opinion remains to be said, so far as the faith is concerned.</p>

<p>10. But in this, he says, I convict you, that you have translated the work of Origen, in
which he says that there is to be a restitution of all things, in which we must believe that not
only sinners but the devil himself and his angels will at last be relieved from their punishment,
if we are to set before our minds in a consistent manner what is meant by the restitution of
all things. And Origen, he says, teaches further that souls have been made before their
bodies, and have been brought down from heaven and inserted into their bodies. I am not
now acting on Origen’s behalf, nor writing an apology for him. Whether he stands accepted
before God or has been cast away is not mine to judge: to his own lord he stands or falls.2837
But I am compelled to make mention of him in a few words, since our great rhetorician,
though seeming to be arguing against him is really striking at me; and this he does no longer
indirectly, but ends by openly attacking me with his sword drawn and turns his whole fury
against me. I say too little in saying that he attacks me; for indeed, in order to vent his rage
against me, he does not even spare his old teacher:2838 he thinks that in the books which I
have translated he can find something which may enable him to hurl his calumnies against
me. In addition to other things which he finds to blame in me he adds this invidious remark,
that I have chosen for translation a work which neither he nor any of the older translators
had chosen. I will begin, therefore, since it is here that I am chiefly attacked, by stating how
it came to pass that I attempted the translation of this work in preference to any other, and
I will do so in the fewest and truest words. This is, no doubt, superfluous for you, my wellbeloved
son, since you know the whole affair as it occurred; yet it is desirable that those who
are ignorant of it should know the truth: besides, both he and all his followers make this a
triumphant accusation against me, that I promised in my Preface to adopt one method of
translation but adopted a different one in the work itself. Hence, I will make an answer
which will serve not only for them, but for many besides whose judgment is perverted either
by their own malice or by the accusations which others make against me.</p>

<p>11. Some time ago, Macarius, a man of distinction from his faith, his learning, his noble
birth and his personal life, had in hand a work against fatalism or, as it is called, Mathesis,2839
and was spending much necessary and fruitful toil on its composition; but he could not
decide many points, especially how to speak of the dispensations of divine Providence. He
found the matter to be one of great difficulty. But in the visions of the night the Lord, he
said, had shown him the appearance of a ship far off upon the sea coming towards him,
which ship, when it entered the port, was to solve all the knotty points which had perplexed
him. When he arose, he began anxiously to ponder the vision, and he found, as he said, that
that was the very moment of my arrival; so that he forthwith made known to me the scope
of his work, and his difficulties, and also the vision which he had seen. He proceeded to inquire
what were the opinions of Origen, whom he understood to be the most renowned
among the Greeks on the points in question, and begged that I would shortly explain his
views on each of them in order. I at first could only say that the task was one of much difficulty:
but I told him that that saintly man the Martyr Pamphilus had to some extent dealt
with the question in a work of the kind he wished, that is in his Apology for Origen. Immediately
he begged me to translate this work into Latin. I told him several times that I had no
practice in this style of composition, and that my power of writing Latin had grown dull
through the neglect of nearly thirty years. He, however, persevered in his request, begging
earnestly that by any kind of words that might be possible, the things which he longed to
know should be placed within his reach. I did what he wished in the best language in my
power; but this only inflamed him with greater desire for the full knowledge of the work itself
from which, as he saw, the few translations which I had made had been taken. I tried to excuse
myself; but he urged me with vehemence, taking God to witness of his earnest request to
me not to refuse him the means which might assist him in doing a good work. It was only
because he insisted so earnestly, and it seemed clear that his desire was according to the will
of God, that I at length acquiesced, and made the translation.</p>

<p>12. But I wrote a Preface2840 to each of these works, and in both, but especially in the
Preface to the work of Pamphilus, which was translated first, I set in the forefront an exposition
of my faith, affirming that my belief is in accordance with the catholic faith; and I
stated that whatever men might find in the original or in my translation, my share in it in
no way implicated my own faith, and further, in reference to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν I gave this
warning. I had found that in these books some things relating to the faith were set forth in
a catholic sense, just as the Church proclaims them, while in other places, when the very
same thing is in question, expressions of a contrary kind are used. I had thought it right to
set forth these points in the way in which the author had set them forth when he had propounded
the catholic view of them: on the other hand, when I found things which were
contrary to the author’s real opinion, I looked on them as things inserted by others, (for he
witnesses by the complaints contained in his letter that this has been done), and therefore
rejected them, or at all events considered that I might omit them as having none of the
“godly edifying in the faith.” It will not, I think, be considered superfluous to insert these
passages from my Prefaces, so that proof may be at hand for each statement. And further,
to prevent the reader from falling into any mistake as to the passages which I insert from
other documents, I have, where the quotation is from my own works, placed a single mark
against the passage, but, where the words are those of my opponent, a double mark.2841</p>

<p>13. In the Preface to the Apology of Pamphilus, after a few other remarks, I said:
‘What the opinions of Origen are may be gathered from the tenor of this treatise. But
as for those things in which he is found to contradict himself, I will point out how this has
come to pass in a few words which I have added at the close of this Preface. As for us, we
believe what has been delivered to us by the holy Prophets, namely: that the holy Trinity is
coeternal, and is of one power and substance: and that the Son of God in these last days was
made man and suffered for our sins, and, in that very flesh in which he suffered, rose from
the dead; and thereby imparted the hope of a resurrection to the whole race of men. When
we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so not with any subterfuges, as some slanderously
affirm: we believe that the flesh which is to rise is this very flesh in which we now
live: we do not put one thing for another, nor when we say body, mean something different
from this flesh. If, therefore, we say that the body is to rise again, we speak as the Apostle
spoke; for this word body was the word which he employed: Or if, again, we speak of the
flesh, our confession coincides with the words of the creed. It is a foolish and calumnious
invention to imagine that the human body can be anything but flesh. Whether, then, we say
that it is flesh according to the common faith, or body according to the Apostle, which is
to rise again, our belief must be held, according to the definition given by the Apostle, with
the understanding that that which is to rise again is to be raised in power and in glory, an
incorruptible and a spiritual body. While, therefore, we maintain the superior excellence of
the body or flesh which is to be, we must hold that the flesh which rises again will be real
and perfect; the actual nature of the flesh will be preserved, while the glorious condition of
the uncorrupted and spiritual body will not be impaired. For so it is written:2842 “Corruption
shall not inherit incorruption.” This is what is preached at Jerusalem in the church of God,
by its reverend bishop John: this is what we with him confess and hold. If any one believes
or teaches anything besides this, or thinks that we believe otherwise than as we have stated,
let him be anathema.’</p>
<p>If then any one wishes to have a statement of our faith, he has it in these words. And
whatever we read or affirm, or whatever translations we make, we do it without prejudice
to this faith of ours, according to the words of the apostle:2843 “Prove all things, hold fast
that which is good. Abstain from every form of evil.” “And as many as follow this rule, peace
be upon them; and upon the Israel of God.”</p>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14"> 
<pb n="1136"/>
<p>14. I wrote these words beforehand as a statement of my faith, when as yet none of these
calumniators had arisen, so that it should be in no man’s power to say that it was merely
because of their admonition or their compulsion that I said things which I had not believed
before. Moreover, I promised that, whatever the requirements of translation might be, I
would, while complying with them, maintain the principles of my faith inviolate. How then
can any room be left for evil, when the very first word of my confession preserves and defends
me from the suspicion of holding any doctrine inconsistent with it? Besides, as I have said
above. I have learned from the words of the Lord that every one shall be justified or condemned
from his own words and not from those of others.</p>
<p>But I will show how, in the Preface2844 which I prefixed to the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, I
declared what was to be the regulative principle of my translation, and will prove it, as in
the former case, by quoting the words themselves: for it is right to quote from this document
also whatever is pertinent to the matter in hand. I had made honourable mention of the
man who now turns my praise of him into all accusation against me, for his services in
having led the way and having translated a great many works of Origen before I had begun:
I had praised both his eloquence as an expositor and his diligence as a translator, and had
said that I took him as my model in doing a similar work. And then, after a few more sentences,
I continued thus:</p>
<p>‘Him therefore we take as our model so far as in us lies, not indeed in the power of his
eloquence, but in his method of doing his work, taking care not to reproduce things which
are found in the books of Origen discrepant and contrary to his own true opinion.’</p>
<p>I beg the reader to observe what I have said, and not to let this sentence escape him because
of its brevity. What I said was that ‘I would not reproduce the things which are found
in the books of Origen discrepant and contrary to his own true opinion.’ I did not make a
general promise that I would not reproduce what was contrary to the faith, nor yet what
was contrary to me or to some one else, but what was contrary to or discrepant from Origen
himself. My opponents must not be allowed to propagate a false statement against me by
snatching at a part of this sentence and saying that I had promised not to reproduce anything
which was contrary to or discrepant from my own belief. If I had been capable of such
conduct, I certainly should not have dared to make a public profession of it. If you find that
this has been done in my work, you will know how to judge of it. But if you find that it has
not been done, you will not think that I am to blame, since I never gave you any pledge
which would bind me to do it.</p>

<p>15. But let me add what comes after. My Preface continued as follows:</p>
<p>‘The causes of these discrepancies I have more fully set forth in the Apology which
Pamphilus expressly wrote for the works of Origen, to which I added a very short paper in
which I shewed by proofs which appear to me quite clear, that his books have been in very
many places tampered with by heretics and ill disposed men, and especially the very books
which you ask me to translate, namely, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, which may be rendered “Concerning
Beginnings”2845 or “Concerning Principalities,” which are in any case most obscure and
most difficult. For in these books Origen discusses matters on which the philosophers have
spent their whole lives without finding out the truth. In these matters, man’s belief in a
creator and his reasoning about the created world which had been made use of by the
philosophers for the purposes of their own profanity, the Christian writer turns to the support
of the true faith.’</p>
<p>Here also I beg you to mark my words carefully, and to observe that I said ‘belief in a
Creator,’ but ‘reasoning about the created world;’ since what is said about God belongs to
the domain of faith, but our discussions about created things to the domain of reason. I
continued:</p>
<p>‘Wherever, therefore, in his works we find erroneous definitions of the Trinity as to
which he has in other places expressed his views in accordance with the true faith, we have
either left them out as passages which had been falsified or inserted, or else have changed
the expression in accordance with the rule of faith which the writer again and again lays
down.’</p>
<p>Have I here, I ask, written incautiously? Have I said that I expressed the matter according
to the rule of our faith, which would have been evidently going far beyond the scope of a
translator whose duty was merely to turn Greek into Latin? On the contrary I said that I
expressed these passages according to the rule of faith which I found again and again laid
down by Origen himself. Moreover I added:</p>
<p>‘I grant that, when he has expressed a thing obscurely, as a man does when he is writing
for those who have technical knowledge of the subject and wishes to go over it rapidly, I
have made the sentence plainer by adding the fuller expression which he had given of the
same thing in some of his other works which I had read. I did this simply in the interests of
clearness. But I have expressed nothing in my own words; I have only restored to Origen
what was really Origen’s though found in other parts of his works.’</p>
<note type="footnote">2845 Or First Principles (De Principiis).</note>
</div>
    

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">

<p>16. I should have thought that this statement, I mean the words, ‘I have expressed
nothing in my own words; I have only restored to Origen what was really Origen’s, though
found in other part of his works,’ would of itself have been sufficient for my defence even
before the most hostile judges. Have I thrust myself forward in any way? Have I ever led
men to expect that I should put in anything of my own? Where can they find the words
which they pretend that I have said, and on which they ground their calumnious accusations,
namely, that I have removed what was bad and put good words instead, while I had translated
literally all that is good? It is time, I think, that they should show some sense of shame, and
should cease from false charges and from taking upon themselves the office of the devil who
is the accuser of the brethren. Let them listen to the words ‘I have put in no words of my
own.’ Let them listen to them again and hear them constantly reiterated, ‘I have put in no
words of my own; I have only restored to Origen what was really Origen’s, though found
in other parts of his works.’ And let them see how God’s mercy watched over me when I
put my hand to this work; let them mark how I was led to forebode the very acts which they
are doing. For my Preface continues thus:</p>
<p>‘I have given this statement in my Preface for fear that my detractors should think that
they had found a fresh reason for accusing me.’</p>
<p>When I said a fresh charge I alluded to the charge which they had previously made
against the reverend Bishop John for the letter written by him to the reverend Bishop
Theophilus2846 on the articles of faith: they pretended that when he spoke of the human
body he meant something—I know not what—different from flesh. Therefore I spoke of a
fresh charge. Take notice, then, I say, of the conduct of these perverse and contentious men.</p>
<p>‘I have undertaken this great labour, (which I have only done at your entreaty) not with
a view of shutting the mouths of my calumniators, which indeed is impossible unless God
himself should do it, but in order to give solid information to those, who are seeking to advance
in knowledge.’</p>
<p>But, to show you that I foresaw and foretold that they would falsify what I was writing,
observe what I said in the following passage:</p>
<p>‘Of this I solemnly warn every one who may read or copy out these books, in the sight
of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and adjure him by our belief in the kingdom
which is to come, by the assurance of the resurrection from the dead, and by that eternal
<note type="footnote">2846 Of Alexandria. He was at first friendly to Origenism, afterwards bitterly opposed to it. John wrote to
him complaining of the conduct of Epiphanius, and explaining his own views. See Jerome’s letter (lxxxii) to
Theophilus, and his Treatise Against John of Jerusalem. In the latter of these charges occur like those here noticed
by Rufinus.</note>

<pb n="1139"/>
fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels,—I adjure him, as he would not have for
his eternal portion that place where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, where their
worm dieth not and their fire is not quenched, that he should add nothing to this writing,
take away nothing, insert nothing, and change nothing.’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after I had warned them by all these dread and terrible forms of adjuration,
these men have not been afraid to become falsifiers and corrupters of my work, though they
profess to believe that the resurrection of the flesh is a reality of the future. Why, if they even
believed the simple fact of the existence of God, they would never set their hands to acts so
injurious and so impious. I ask, further, what line of my Preface can be pointed to in which
I have, as my accuser says, praised Origen up to the skies, or in which I have called him, as
he once did, an Apostle or a Prophet, or anything of the kind. I may ask indeed in what
other matter they find any ground of accusation. I made at the outset a confession of my
faith in terms which I think agree in all respects with the confession of the Church. I made
a clear statement of my canons of translation, which indeed in most respects were taken
from the model furnished by the very man who now comes forward as my accuser. I declared
what was the purpose I set before me in making the translation. Whether I have proved
capable of fulfilling the task more or less completely is, no doubt, a matter for the judgment
of those who read the work, and who may be expected to praise it or to ridicule it, but not
to make it a ground for accusation when it is a question of turning words from one language
into another with more or less propriety.</p>
</div>
    

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17"> 
<pb n="1140"/>
<p>17. But I have said that these men would have been unable to find grounds for accusation
on the points I have mentioned, however they may take them, unless they had first falsified
them. It appears to me therefore desirable that the chief matter on which they have laid their
forgers’ hands should be inserted in this Apology, lest they should think that I am intentionally
withdrawing it from notice because they after making their own additions to it allege
it as a ground of false accusation. In the book which I translated there is a passage in which
I examine the tenets of those who believe that God has a bodily shape and who describe him
as clothed with human members and dress. This is openly asserted by the heretical sects of
the Valentinians and Anthropomorphites, and I see that those who are now our accusers
have been far too ready to hold out the hand to them. Origen in this passage has defended
the faith of the church against them, affirming that God is wholly without bodily form, and
therefore also invisible; and then, following out his scrutiny in a logical manner, he says a
few words in answer to the heretics, which I thus translated into Latin.2847</p>
<p>“But these assertions will perhaps be held to have little authority by those whose desire
is to be instructed out of the Holy Scriptures in the things of God, and who require that
from that source should be drawn the proof of the preïminence of the nature of God over
that of the human body. Consider whether the Apostle does not say the same thing when
he speaks thus of Christ:2848 “Who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every
creature.” The nature of God is not, as some think, visible to some and not to others, for
the Apostle does not say The image of God who is invisible to men, or to sinners; but he
speaks quite distinctly of the nature of God in itself, where he says “The image of the invisible
God.” John also says in his Gospel,2849 “No man hath seen God at any time,” by which he
distinctly declares: to all who can understand, that there is no being to whom God is visible;
not as if he were naturally visible and, like a being of attenuated substance, escaped and
eluded our glance; but that, in his own nature it is impossible for him to be seen. But perhaps
you will ask me my opinion as to the Only begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even
to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss
my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it. Observe
that seeing is a different thing from knowing. Seeing and being seen belong to bodies; to
know and to be known belong to the intellectual nature. Whatever then is merely a property
of bodies, this we must not attribute to the Father or the Son; but that which belongs to the
nature of Deity governs the relations of the Father and the Son. Moreover, Christ himself
in the Gospel2850 did not say “No man seeth the Son but the Father nor the Father but the
<note type="footnote">2847 Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν Book I. c. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">2848 Col. i. 15</note>
<note type="footnote">2849 John i. 18</note>
<note type="footnote">2850 Matt. xi. 27</note>

<pb n="1141"/>
Son,” but “No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither doth any one know the Father
but the Son.” By this it is clearly shown that what is called seeing and being seen in the case
of bodily existence is called knowledge in the case of the Father and the Son: their intercourse
is maintained through the power of knowledge not through the weakness of visibility. Since,
therefore, an incorporeal nature cannot properly be said to see or to be seen, therefore in
the Gospel it is not said either that the Father is seen by the Son or the Son by the Father
but that each is known by the other. And if any one should ask how it is that it is said2851
“Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,” I think that this text will confirm my
assertion still more. For what else is it to see God with the heart than, according to the explanation
I have given above, to understand Him with the mind and to know Him?”</p>
<note type="footnote">2851 Matt. v. 8</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18"> 
<pb n="1142"/>
<p>18. This is the chief passage which those who were sent from the East to lay snares for
me tried to brand as heretical, not only by perversely misunderstanding it, but by falsifying
the words. But I could see nothing to suspect in it, as also in several similar passages of the
writer I was translating, nor did I think that there was any reason to leave it out, since there
was nothing said in it as to a comparison of the Son with the Father, but the question related
to the nature of the Deity itself, whether in any sense the word visibility could be applied to
it. Origen was answering, as I have said before, the heretics who assert that God is visible
because they say that he is corporeal, the faculty of sight being a property of the body; for
which reason the Valentinian heretics, of whom I spoke above, declare that the Father begat
and the Son was begotten in a bodily and visible sense. He therefore shrank, I presume, from
the word Seeing as a suspicious term, and says that it is better, when the question turns upon
the nature of the Deity, that is, upon the relation of the Father and the Son, to use the word
which the Lord himself definitely chose, when he said: “No man knoweth the Son save the
Father, neither doth any know the Father save the Son.” He thought that all occasion which
might be given to the aforesaid heresies would be shut out if, in speaking of the nature of
the Deity he used the word Knowledge rather than Vision. ‘Vision’ might seem to afford
the heretics some support. The word Knowledge on the other hand preserves the true relation
of Father and Son in one nature never to be set apart; and this is specially confirmed by the
authoritative language of the Gospel. Origen thought also that this mode of speaking would
ensure that the Anthropomorphites should never in any way hear God spoken of as visible.
It did not seem to me right that this reasoning, since it made no difference between the
persons of the Trinity, should be completely thrown on one side, though indeed there were
some words in the Greek, which perhaps were somewhat incautiously used, and which I
thought it well to avoid using. I will suppose that readers may hesitate in their judgment
whether or not even so, it is an argument which can be employed with effect against the
aforesaid heresies. I will even grant that those who are practised in judging of words and
their sense in matters of this kind and who, besides being experts, are God-fearing men,
men who do nothing through strife or vain glory, whose mind is equally free from envy and
favour and prejudice may say that the point is of little value either for edification or for the
combating of heresy; even so, is it not competent for them to pass it over and to leave it
aside as not valid for the repulse of our adversaries? Suppose it to be superfluous, does that
make it criminous? How can we count as a criminal passage one which asserts the equality
of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit in this point of invisibility? I do not think that any
one can really think so. I say any one: for there is no evidence that anything contained in
my writings is offensive in the eyes of my accusers; for, if they had thought so, they would
have set down my words as they stood in my translation.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19"> 
<pb n="1143"/>
<p>19. But what did they actually do? Consider what it was and ask yourself whether the
crime is not unexampled? Recall the passage which says: “But perhaps you will ask me my
opinion as to the Only-begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature
of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if
it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it.” Well, in the place of
the words which I had written, “I will at once give you my reason for it” they put the following
words: “Do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for, as the Son does not
see the Father, so the Holy Spirit also does not see the Son.” If the man who did this, the
man who was sent from their monastery2852 to Rome as the greatest expert in calumny, had
been employed in the forum and had committed this forgery in some secular business every
one knows what would be the consequence to him according to the public laws, when he
was convicted of the crime. But now, since he has left the secular life, and has turned his
back upon business and entered a monastery, and has connected himself with a renowned
master, he has learned from him to leave his former self-restraint and to become a furious
madman: he was quiet before, now he is a mover of sedition: he was peaceable, now he
provokes war: instead of concord, he is the promoter of strife. For faith he has learnt perfidiousness,
for truth forgery. He would, you may well think, have been the complete exemplar
of wickedness and criminality of this kind, if you had not had before you the image of that
woman Jezebel.2853 She is the same who made up the accusation against Naboth the
Zezreelite for the sake of the vineyard, and sent word to the wicked elders to urge against
him a false indictment, saying that he had blessed, that is cursed, God and the king. I know
not whether of the two is to be accounted the happier, she who sends the command or they
who obey it in all its iniquity. These matters are serious; such a crime, as far as I know, is
hitherto all but unheard of in the Church. Yet there is something more to be said. What is
that you ask. It is this, that those who are guilty should become the judges, that those who
plotted the accusation should also pronounce the sentence. It is, indeed, no new thing for
a writer to make a mistake or a slip in his words, and in my opinion it is a venial fault, for
the Scripture also says,2854 “In many things we all stumble: if any stumbleth not in word
the same is a perfect man.” Is it thought that some word is wrong? Then let it be corrected
or amended, or, if expediency so require, let it be taken out. But to insert in what another
man has written things he never wrote, to put in false words for no other purpose than to
defame your brother, to corrupt his writings in order to attach a mark of infamy to the author,
and to insinuate your ideas into the ears of the multitude so as to throw confusion into the

minds of the simple; and all this with the object of staining a man’s reputation among his
fellows; I ask you whose work this can be except that of him who was a liar from the beginning,
and who, from accusing the brethren, received the name of Diabolus, which means
accuser. For when he to whom I have alluded2855 recited at Milan one of these sentences
which had been tampered with, and I cried out that what he was reading was falsified, he,
being asked from whom he had received the copy of the work said that a certain woman
named Marcella had given it him. As to her, I say nothing, whosoever she may be. I leave
her to her own conscience and to God. I am content with God’s own witness and with yours.
When I say yours, I mean your own and that of Macarius himself, the saintly man for whom
I was doing that work: for both of you read my papers themselves at the first, even before
they had been completed, and you have by you the completely corrected copies. You can
bear witness to what I say. The words “as the Son does not see the Father, so also the Holy
Spirit does not see the Son” not only were never written by me, but on the contrary I can
point out the forger by whom they were written. If any man says that as the Father does not
see the Son, so the Son does not see the Father or that the Holy Spirit does not see the
Father and the Son as the Father sees the Son and the Son and the Holy Spirit, let him be
anathema. For he sees, and sees most truly; only, as God sees God and the Light sees the
Light; not as flesh sees flesh, but as the Holy Spirit sees, not with the bodily senses, but by
the powers of the Deity. I say, if any one denies this let him be anathema for all eternity. But
as the Apostle says,2856 “He that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.”</p>

<p>20. I remember indeed that one of these people, when he was convicted of having falsified
this passage, answered me that it was so in the Greek, but that I had, of purpose, changed
it in the Latin. I do not indeed, treat this as a serious accusation because, though what they
say is untrue yet, even supposing that the words did stand so in the Greek, and I had changed
them in the Latin, this is nothing more than I had said in my Preface that I should do. If I
had done this with the view of making an expression which in the Greek was calculated to
make men stumble run more suitably in the Latin, I should have been acting only according
to my expressed purpose and plan. But I say to my accusers You certainly did not find these
words in the Latin copies of my work. Whence then did it come into the papers from which
he was reading? I, the translator, did not so write it. Whence then came the words which
you who have got no such words of mine turn into a ground of accusation? Am I to be accused
on the ground of your forgeries? I put the matter in the plainest possible way. There
are four books of the work which I translated; and in these books discussions about the
Trinity occur in a scattered way, almost as much as one in each page. Let any man read the
whole of these and say whether in any passage of my translation such an opinion concerning
the Trinity can be found as that which they calumniously represent as occurring in this
chapter. If such an opinion can be found, then men may believe that this chapter also is
composed in the sense which they pretend. But if in the whole body of these books no such
difference of the persons of the Trinity exists anywhere, would not a critic be mad or fatuous
if he decided, on the strength of a single paragraph, that a writer had given his adherence
to a heresy which in the thousand or so other paragraphs of his work he had combated? But
the circumstances of the case are by themselves sufficient to shew the truth to any one who
has his wits about him. For if this man had really found the passage in question in my papers,
and had felt a difficulty in what he read, he would of course have brought the documents
to me and have at once asked for explanations, since, as you well know, we were living as
neighbours in Rome. Up to that time we often saw one another, greeted one another as
friends, and joined together in prayer; and therefore he would certainly have conferred with
me about the points which appeared to him objectionable; he would have asked me how I
had translated them, and how they stood in the Greek.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21"> 
<pb n="1146"/>
<p>21. I am sure that he would have felt that he had enjoyed a triumph if he could have
shown that through his representations I had been induced to correct anything that I had
said or written. Or, if he had been driven by his mental excitement to expose the error
publicly instead of correcting it, he certainly would not have waited till I had left Rome to
attack me, when he might have faced me there and put me to silence. But he was deterred
by the consciousness that he was acting falsely; and therefore he did not bring to me as their
author the documents which he was determined to incriminate, but carried them round to
private houses, to ladies, to monasteries, to Christian men one by one, wherever he might
make trouble by his ex parte statements. And he did this just when he was about to leave
Rome, so that he might not be arraigned and made to give an account of his actions. Afterwards,
by the directions, as I am told, of his master, he went about all through Italy, accusing
me, stirring up the people, throwing confusion into the churches, poisoning even the minds
of the bishops, and everywhere representing my forbearance as an acknowledgment that I
was in the wrong. Such are the arts of the disciple. Meanwhile the master, out in the East,
who had said in his letter to Vigilantius2857 “Through my labour the Latins know all that
is good in Origen and are ignorant of all that is bad,” set to work upon the very books which
I had translated, and in his new translation inserted all that I had left out as untrustworthy,
so that now, the contrary of what he had boasted has come to pass. The Romans by his labour
know all that is bad in Origen and are ignorant of all that is good. By this means he endeavours
to draw not Origen only but me also under the suspicion of heresy: and he goes on
unceasingly sending out these dogs of his to bark against me in every city and village, and
to attack me with their calumnies when I am quietly passing on a journey, and to attempt
every speakable and unspeakable mischief against me. What crime, I ask you, have I committed
in doing exactly what you have done? If you call me wicked for following your example,
what judgment must you pronounce upon yourself?</p>
<note type="footnote">2857 Jerome, Letter lxi, c, 2; a passage which shows that Jerome had adopted much the same method as
Rufinus in translating Origen.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22"> 
<pb n="1147"/>
<p>22. But now I will turn the tables and put my accuser to the question. Tell me, O great
master, if there is anything to blame in a writer, is the blame to be laid on one who reads or
translates his works? Heaven forbid, he will say; certainly not; why do you try to circumvent
me by your enigmatical questions? Am not I myself both a reader and a translator of Origen?
Read my translations and see if you can find any one of his peculiar doctrines in them; especially
any of those which I now mark for condemnation. When driven to the point he says:</p>
<p>“If you wish thoroughly to see how abhorent the very suggestion of such doctrines has
always been to me, read my Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, and you
will see from what I have written there what an opinion I formed of him from reading and
translating his works.”2858</p>
<p>I ask, can we accept this man as a great and grave teacher, who in one of his works
praises Origen and in another condemns him? who in his Introductions calls him a master
second only to the Apostles, but now calls him a heretic? What heretic, I ask, was ever called
a master of the churches? “It is true, he replies, I was wrong about this but why do you go
on bringing up this unfortunate Preface2859 against me? Read my Commentaries, and especially
those which I have designated.” Is there any one who will think this satisfactory? He
has composed a great many books, in almost all of which he trumpets forth the praises of
Origen to the skies: these books through all these years have been read and are being read
by all men: many of these readers after accepting his opinions have left this world and gone
into the presence of the Lord. They hold the opinion about Origen which they had learnt
from the statements of this man, and they departed in hope that, according to this man’s
assurance, they would find him there as a master second only to the Apostles; but if we are
to trust his present writings, they have found him in a state of condemnation, among the
impious heretics and the heathen. Is this man now to turn round from his former contention,
and to say, “For some thirty years I have been, in my studies and in my writings, praising
Origen as equal to the Apostles, but now I pronounce him a heretic?” How is this? Has he
come upon some new books of his which he had never read before? Not at all. It is from
these same sayings of Origen that he formerly called him an Apostle and now calls him a
heretic. But it is impossible that this should really have been so. For either he was right in
his former praises, and his judgment has since been perverted by some kind of extreme ill
feeling, and in that case no attention is to be paid to him; or else his former praises were
mistaken, and he is now condemning himself, and in that case what judgment does he think

others will pass upon him, when, according to the words of the Apostle,2860 he passes condemnation
on himself.</p>
<p>22 (a). But, “Surely,” he says, “this judgment is done away with since I have repented.”
Not so fast! We all err, it is true, and especially in word; and we all may repent of our errors.
But can a man do penance, and accuse others, and judge and condemn them, all in the same
moment? That would be as if a harlot who had abstained from her harlotry for a night or
two, should feel called upon to begin writing laws in favour of chastity, and not only to enact
these laws, but to proceed to throw down the monuments of all the women who have died,
because she suspected that they had led lives like her own. You do penance for having
formerly been a heretic, and you do right. But what has that to do with me who never was
a heretic at all? You are right in doing penance for your error: but the true way of doing
penance is, not by accusing others but by crying for mercy, not by condemning but by
weeping. For what sincerity can there be in penitence when the penitent makes a decree of
indulgence for himself? He who repents of what he has spoken ill does not cure his wound
by speaking ill again, but by keeping silence. For thus it is written:2861 “Thou hast sinned,
be at peace.” But now you first bring yourself in a criminal, then you absolve yourself from
your crime, and forthwith change yourself from a criminal into a judge. This may be no
trouble to you who thus mock at us, but it is a trouble to us if we suffer ourselves to be
mocked by you.</p>

<p>23. But let us come to these two Commentaries which he alone excepts from the general
condemnation and renunciation which he pronounces upon all the rest of his works; we
shall see with what modesty and self-restraint he conducts himself in these: Remember that
it is by these alone that he has chosen to prove that he is sound in the faith, and that he is
altogether opposed to Origen. Let us examine then as witnesses these two books which alone
of all his writings are satisfactory to him, namely, the three books of his commentary on the
Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, and the single book (I think) on Ecclesiastes. Let us for a
moment look into the one which comes forward first, the Commentary on the Epistle to
the Ephesians. Even here recognize in his arguments the influence of him who is as his fellow,
his partner and his brother mystic, to use his own expression.2862 And first of all, as to these
poor weak women about whom he makes himself merry, because they say that after the resurrection
they will not have their frail bodies since they will be like the angels. Let us hear
what he has to say about them. In the third book of his Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul
to the Ephesians, on the passage in which it is said,2863 “He who loveth his own wife loveth
himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh;” after a few other remarks, he says:</p>
<p>“Let us men then cherish our wives and let our souls cherish our bodies in such a way
as that the wives may be turned into men and the bodies into spirits, and that there maybe
no difference of sex but that, as among the angels there is neither male nor female, so we
who are to be like the angels may begin here to be what it is promised that we shall be in
heaven.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24"> 
<pb n="1150"/>
<p>24. How, I ask, can you, seeing that your Commentaries contain such doctrines, put
them forward to prove your soundness in the faith, and to confute those ideas which you
reprove? How do your words tend to reprove those women whom we have spoken of? Besides,
has any woman gone so far as to say what you write, namely, that women are to be
turned into men and bodies into souls? If bodies are to be turned into spirits, then, according
to you, there will be no resurrection not only of the flesh but even of the body, which you
admit to be the doctrine even of those whom you have set down as heretics. Where are we
to look any more for the body, if it is reduced to a spirit? In that case everything will be
spirit, the body will be nowhere. And again, if the wives are to be turned into men, according
to this suggestion of yours, that there is to be no difference of sex whatever, by which I
suppose you mean that the female sex will entirely cease, being converted into the male, and
the male sex will alone remain; I am not sure that you would have the permission of the
women to speak here on behalf of their sex. But, even suppose that they grant you this, then
with what consistency can you argue that the male sex is any longer necessary, when the
female is shown not to be necessary? for there is a natural bond which unites the sexes in
mutual dependence, so that, if one does not exist, there is no need of the other. And further,
if it is man alone who is to receive at the resurrection the form of clay which was originally
given in paradise, what becomes of that which is written,2864 “He made them male and female,
and blessed them”? And then, if, as both you yourself say, and also these poor women
whom you arraign, there is neither man nor woman, how can bodies be turned into souls,
or women into men, since Paradise does not allow the existence of either sex, nor does the
likeness of angels, as you say, admit it? And I marvel how you can demand from others a
strict opinion upon the continuance of the diversity of sex when you yourself, as soon as
you begin to discuss it, find yourself involved in so many knotty questions that to evolve
yourself out of them becomes impossible. How much more right would your action be if
you were to imitate us whom you blame in such matters as these and allow God to be the
only judge of them, as is indeed the truth. It would be far better for you to confess your ignorance
of them than to write things which in a little while you have to condemn. I should
like to ask my accuser whether he can conscientiously say that he would ever have found, I
do not say in any, even the least, work of mine, but even in any familiar letter which I might
have written carelessly to a friend, such things as that bodies were to be turned into spirits
and wives into men, were it not that he had put them forward as if he wished them to be
inserted in brazen letters on the gates of cities, and recited in the forum, in the Senate house
and in front of the rostra. If he had found any such thing in my writings, imagine how many
heads of accusation he would have set down, how many volumes he would have compiled,
how he would be assailing me with all the arms and shafts of that teeming breast of his; how
<note type="footnote">2864 Gen. i. 27</note>

<pb n="1151"/>
he would have said: “I tell you that he is deceiving you by speaking of the resurrection of
the body, for he denies the resurrection of the flesh; or even if he confesses the resurrection
of the flesh he denies that of the members and the sex: but, if you do not believe me, behold
and see the very words of his letter, in which he says that bodies are to be turned into souls
and wives into men.” Yet, when you write this, we are not to call you a heretic, but are to
give satisfaction to you as though you were our master. And as for those women whom you
have attacked with your indecent reproaches, they will, when they stand before the judgment
seat of Christ, bring forward what you have taught them in these Commentaries as well as
the things which you have since written, with insults which show that you had forgotten
yourself; and both the one and the other will be read out there, where the favour of men will
have ceased, and the applause for which you pay by flattery will be silent, and they will be
judged together with their author for these words and deeds of yours before Christ the
righteous judge.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25"> 
<pb n="1152"/>
<p>25. But now let us go on to discuss what he writes further as to God’s judgment,2865 for
this too is a matter of the faith. We shall find that as he alters the faith about the resurrection
of the flesh in other points, so he does in reference to God’s judgment. In the first book of
the Commentaries on the Ep. of Paul to the Ephesians, he deals with that passage in which
the Apostle says: “Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we
should be holy and without blemish before him.” On this he says:</p>
<p>“For the foundation of the world the Greek has καταβολῆς κόσμου. The word καταβολή
does not mean the same which we understand by foundation. We, therefore, shall not attempt
to render a word for a word, which is here impossible on account of the poverty of our language
and also the novelty of the sense, and because, as some one has said, the Greeks have
a larger discourse and a happier tongue than ours. We must explain the force of the word
by some sort of periphrasis. καταβολή is properly used when something is thrown down
and is cast from a higher into a lower place, or else when anything is taking its beginning.
Hence those who lay the first foundations of future houses are said καταβεβληκέναι, that
is to have thrown down the first foundations. Paul thus used the word to show that God
framed all things out of nothing: he assigned to Him not a creation nor a building up, nor
a making but a καταβολή, that is, a beginning of a foundation. He wishes to show that there
was not some other thing antecedent to creatures, and out of which creatures were formed,
as is held by the Manichæans and other heretics, who begin with a maker and a material,
but that all things were made out of nothing. But, as to our election to be holy and without
blemish before him, that is, before God, previously to the making of the world, of which the
Apostle speaks, this belongs to the foreknowledge of God, to whom all future things are as
if they were already done, and all things are known before they come into being: as Paul is
predestinated in the womb of his mother, and Jeremiah before his birth is sanctified, chosen,
and confirmed, and, as it type of Christ, is sent to be a prophet of the nations.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">    
<pb n="1153"/>
<p>26. So far he has set forth a single exposition of the passage; but on whose authority he
wishes us to receive this interpretation he has not made clear. What he has done is to make
void this first interpretation by what comes after: for he goes on: “But there is another, who
tries to show that God is just.” He therefore points out that by that first exposition the justice
of God is not vindicated, which of course is contrary to the faith: and he goes on through
the mouth of this ‘other,’ whose assertions he evidently wishes to exhibit as being what is
everywhere held for catholic and indubitable, to give a testimony by which he will, as he
asserts, seek to show that God is just. Let us see then what this ‘other man’ says, who proclaims
the justice of God.</p>
<p>“Another man,” he says, “who seeks to vindicate the justice of God, argues that it is not
according to his own pre-judgment and knowledge, but according to the merit of the elect
that God’s choice of men is determined; and he says that, before the creation of the visible
world, of sky and earth and seas and all that they contain, there existed other invisible
creatures, among which also were souls; and that these souls, for reasons known to God
alone, were cast down2866into this vale of tears, this place of our mournful pilgrimage, and
that this is shewn by the prayer uttered by a holy man of old who, having his habitation
fixed here, yet longed to return to his original abode: “Woe is me that my sojourning is
prolonged, that I have my habitation among the inhabitants of Kedar,”2867 “my soul has
long been a pilgrim,” and again “O wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from the
body of this death?”2868 and in another place “It is better to return and be with Christ,”2869
and elsewhere, “Before I was brought low, I sinned;”2870 and other words of a like character.”</p>
<p>This relates, they say to the souls’ condition before they were cast down into the world.
The reader of this will be apt to say, Master, you seem to tell us, yet do not really tell us, who
these men are who say this, that the souls of men existed before they were cast down into
the world. Then he will reply, “Was I not right in saying that you were blind, and no better
than a mole? Did I not say before, that they are those who assert that God is just,—by which,
if you had any sense at all, you would understand that I mean myself: for I am not such a
heretic as not to include myself among those who vindicate the justice of God, which indeed
all must do who have the least tincture of good sense.” Then they will reply, “Tell us, then,
master, tell us, what it is that these men say, and you among them? We understand that you
say that before the souls were cast down into the world, and before the world, which was

made up of souls, had been cast down together with its inhabitants into the abyss, God chose
Paul and those like him, who were holy and undefiled. But if men are chosen, they are chosen
out of a great number; there must be many in a worse condition out of whom the election
is made. However, just as in the Babylonian captivity, when Nebuchadnezzar carried away
the people into Chaldæa, Ezekiel and Daniel and the Three Children, and Haggai and
Zechariah were sent with them, not because they deserved to become captives, but that they
might be a comfort to those who were carried away; so also, in that ‘casting down’ of the
world, those who had been chosen by God before the world was, were sent to instruct and
train the sinful souls, so that these, through their preaching, might return to the place from
which they had fallen; and this is what is meant by the words of the eighty-ninth Psalm:2871
“Lord thou hast been our refuge in generation and in offspring, before the mountains were
established, or the earth and the world were made;” that is to say, that before the world was
made, and a beginning was made of the generation of all things, God was a refuge to his
saints.”</p>

<p>27. Such are the doctrines which are to be found in these works of yours which you
single out from all that you have written, and which you desire men to read over again to
the prejudice of all the rest. It is in these very Commentaries that these doctrines are written.
There was, you say, an invisible world before this visible one came into being. You say that
in this world, along with the other inhabitants, that is the angels, there were also souls. You
say that these souls, for reasons known to God alone, enter into bodies at the time of birth
in this visible world: those souls, you say, who in a former age had been inhabitants of
heaven, now dwell here, on this earth, and that not without reference to certain acts which
they had committed while they lived there. You say further that all the saints, such as Paul
and others like him in each generation were predestinated by God for the purpose of recalling
them by their preaching to that habitation from which they had fallen: and all this you
support by very copious warranties of Scripture. But are not these statements precisely those
for which you now arraign Origen, and for which alone you demand that he should be
condemned? What ‘other’ than him who says such things as these do you condemn in your
writings? And yet if these statements are to be condemned, as you now urge, you will first
pronounce judgment on these statements, and then find that you have condemned yourself
by anticipation. No other refuge remains for you. There is no room for any of these twists
and turns for which you blame others: for it is just when you are doing penance and have
been converted, when you have been corrected and put in the way of amendment, that you
have stamped these books with fresh authority, to prove to us by their means what your
opinion was as to the doctrines which ought to be condemned: and therefore what you have
there written must be taken as if we heard you now distinctly making the statements contained
in them. Yet in these very books you yourself make the statements which you say are
to be condemned. But no! you will say: it is not I that make them. It is the ‘other’ who thus
speaks, that is, of course, the man who I now declare ought to be condemned. Well, let us
recall, if you please, that particular line in which you change the person of the speaker, that
we may see who it is whom you represent as building up this strange theory. You say, then,
that it is ‘another,’ who is endeavouring to show that God is just, who says these things
which we have set down just above. If you say that this ‘other’ who by this assertion of his
proves God to be just is separate and divers from yourself, what then, I ask, is your own
opinion? Must we say that you deny that God is just? Oh, great Master, you who see so
sharply, and are so hard upon the moles that have no eyes:2872 you seem to have got yourself
into a most impossible position, where you are shut in on every side. Either you must deny
that God is just by declaring yourself other than, and contrary to, him who says these things,
or if you confess God to be just, as all the Church does, then it is you yourself who make
the assertions in question; in which case the sentence which you pass upon another falls
<note type="footnote">2872 Talpas oculis captos. Virg, Georg. i, 183.</note>

<pb n="1156"/>
upon you, you are thrust through with your own spear. I think that this is enough for your
conviction before the most righteous judges whose judgment anticipates that of God: not
that they would condemn the man who sees the mote in his brother’s eye but does not see
the beam in his own; but they would try to bring him to a better mind and to true repentance.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28"> 
<pb n="1157"/>
<p>28. But it is possible that this particular passage may have escaped his observation, although
he thought that he had revised these books so as to make them perfectly clear, and
put them forward as giving a profession of his faith, to the prejudice of all the rest. Let us
see then what are his opinions in other parts. In the same book when he comes to the passage
where it is written “According to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glory,” he
makes these remarks among others:</p>
<p>“Here certain men seize upon the opportunity to introduce their peculiar views: they
believe that before the foundation of the world, the souls of men dwelt in the heavenly Jerusalem
with the angels, and with all the other celestial powers. They think that it would be
impossible, in accordance with the good pleasure of God, and the praise of his glory and of
his grace, to explain the fact that some men are born poor and barbarous, in slavery and
weakness, while others are born as wealthy Roman citizens, free and with strong health; that
some are born in a low, some in a high station, that they are born in different countries, in
different parts of the world: unless there are some antecedent causes for which each individual
soul had its lot assigned according to its merits. Moreover, the passage which some
think that they understand, (though they do not) the passage of the Epistle to the Romans
which says,2873 “Hath not the potter a right over the clay from the same lump to make one
part a vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?” these men take as supporting this
same view; for they argue that, just as the distinction between leading a good life or a bad,
one of labour or self-indulgence, would be of little account if we did not believe in the
judgment of God which is to come, so also the difference of conditions under which men
are born would impugn the justice of God unless they were the results of the soul’s previous
deserts. For, if we do not accept this view, they say, it cannot be ‘the good pleasure of God’
nor ‘to the praise of his glory and grace’ that he should have chosen some before the
foundation of the world to be holy and undefiled, and to partake of the adoption through
Jesus Christ, and should have appointed others to the lowest position and to everlasting
punishment; he could not have loved Jacob before he came forth from the womb and hated
Esau before he had done anything worthy of hatred, unless there were some antecedent
causes which would, if we knew them, prove God to be just.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2873 Rom. ix. 21</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">    
<pb n="1158"/>
<p>29. What can be more distinct than this statement? What could possibly be thought or
said whether by Origen or by any of those whom you say that you condemn, which would
be clearer than this, that the inequality of conditions which exists among those who are
born into this world is ascribed to the justice of God? You say that the cause of the salvation
or perdition of each soul is to be found in itself, that is, in the passions and dispositions
which it has shown in its previous life in that new Jerusalem which is the mother of us all.
“But this too,” he will say no doubt, “is not said by myself. I described it as the opinion of
another: moreover, I used the expression ‘they seize upon the opportunity.’” Well, I do not
deny that you make it appear that you are speaking of another. But you have not denied
that this man about whom you are speaking is in agreement and accord with you: you have
not said that he is in opposition or hostility to you. For, when you use this formula of ‘another’
in reference to one who is really opposed to you, you habitually, after setting down
a few of his words, at once impugn and overthrow them: you do this in the case of Marcion,
Valentinus, Arius and others. But when, as in this instance, you use, indeed, this formula
of ‘another,’ but report his words fortified by the strongest assertions and by the most
abundant testimonies of Scripture, is it not evident even to us who are so slow of understanding,
and whom you speak of as ‘moles,’ that he whose words you set down and do not
overthrow, is no other than yourself, and that we have here a case of the figure well known
to rhetoricians, when they use another man’s person to set forth their own opinions. Such
figures are resorted to by rhetoricians when they are afraid of offending particular people,
or when they wish to avoid exciting ill-will against themselves. But, if you think that you
have avoided blame by putting forward ‘another’ as the author of these statements, how
much more free from it is he whom you accuse. For his mode of action is much more cautious.
He is not content with merely saying, “This is what others say,” or “so some men
think,” but, “As to this or that I do not decide, I only suggest,” and, “If this seems to any one
more probable, let him hold to it, putting the other aside.” He has been very careful in his
statements, as you know; and yet you summon him to be tried and condemned. You think
that you have escaped because you speak of ‘another’: but the points on which you condemn
him are precisely those in which you follow and imitate him.</p>
</div>
    

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30"> 
<pb n="1159"/>
<p>30. But let us proceed in our study of these Commentaries; otherwise, in dwelling too
long upon a few special points, we may be prevented from taking notice of the greater
number. In the same book and the same passage2874 are the words “To the end that we
should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.” His comment
is:</p>
<p>“If it had been simply said ‘We have trusted in Christ,’ and there had not been the prefix
‘before,’ which stands in the Greek προηλπικότες, the sense would be quite clear, namely,
that those who have hoped in Christ have been chosen in due order2875 and have been
predestinated according to the purpose of him who orders all things according to the
counsel of his own will. But, as it stands, the addition of the preposition ‘before,’ compels
us to explain it according to the same ideas which we argued in a former place to be necessary
for the explanation of the passage, “Who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the
heavenly places in Christ, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
that we should be holy and without blemish before him:” namely, that God had blessed us
before in heaven with all spiritual blessing, and had chosen us before the world was framed;
and that thus we are said to have hoped in Christ ‘before,’ that is, in the time when we were
elected and predestinated and blessed in heaven.”</p>

<p>31. But let this pass, for what follows is of more importance. I thank God that he has
relieved me from a very serious burden of suspicion. Perhaps I seemed to some people to
be acting contentiously and calumniously when I insinuated that, according to a figure of
rhetoric, when he spoke of ‘another’ he meant himself. But to prevent all further doubt from
resting in the minds of his hearers, he has himself declared that it is so. Like a truly good
teacher, who would not wish any ambiguity about his sayings to remain in the minds of his
pupils, he has been so good as to shew quite clearly who that ‘other’ was of whom he had
spoken before. He therefore says, “But, as it stands, the addition of the preposition ‘before’
leads us to explain it according to the ideas which we argued in a former place to be necessary.”
You see, he means that it is we, and not some other, no one knows who, as you may
have thought, who in the former place argued thus, when we were expounding the words
“Who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.” It was
to meet the case of the less intelligent persons, who might think that what was there said
was spoken by some one else, to prevent any error on the point remaining in the minds of
those whom he had begged to read these books so that they might see what his opinion of
Origen was, that he now acknowledges this opinion as his own, and, no longer speaking of
‘another,’ says what we have quoted before; namely, that, as God had before blessed us with
all spiritual blessing in Christ in the heavenly places, and had chosen us before the foundation
of the world; so also we are said to have trusted in Christ at that former time in which we
were elected and predestinated and blessed in heaven. He himself therefore, as it seems to
me, has by his own testimony, absolved me from all suspicion of speaking a calumny when
I say that that ‘other’ is no ‘other’ than himself.</p>
 
<pb n="1161"/>
<p>30 (a). But, I undertook to shew something of more importance still in what follows.
After he had said that we had hoped in Christ before, and that in the time before the
foundation of the world and before we were born in our bodies, we had been blessed and
chosen in heaven, he again introduces that ‘other’ of his, and says: “Another, who does not
admit this doctrine that we had a previous existence and had hope in Christ before we lived
in this body, would have us understand the matter in his own way.” In this passage this
‘other,’ whoever he may be, has put forth all his ill savour. Let him tell us then whom he
means by this ‘other’ who does not admit this opinion that before we lived in this body we
both existed and hoped in Christ—for which he requires us to condemn Origen. Whom
does he wish us to understand by this ‘other’? Is it some one opposed to himself? What do
you say, great master? You are pressed by that two-horned dilemma of which you are so
fond of speaking to your disciples. For, if you say that by this ‘other’ who does not admit
that souls existed before they lived in the body you mean yourself, you have betrayed the
secret which in the previous passages was concealed. It is now found out that you by your
own confession are that other who have fashioned all the doctrines of which you now demand
the condemnation. But if we are not to believe you to be the ‘other’ of the former passage,
so that the doctrines which you now impugn may not be ascribed to you, we have no right
to consider you in this case to be the ‘other’ who does not admit that our souls existed before
we lived in bodies. Choose either side you like as the ground of your acquittal. This ‘other,’
whom you so frequently bring in, are we to understand by him yourself or some one else?
Do you wish that he should be thought by us to be a catholic or a heretic? Is he to be acquitted
or condemned? If that ‘other’ of yours is a catholic, the man who said in the former passage
that before this visible world our souls had their abode among the angels and the other
heavenly powers in the heavenly places in Jerusalem which is above, and that they there
contracted those dispositions which caused the diversities of their birth into the world and
of the other conditions to which they are now subject, then these must be esteemed to be
catholic doctrines, and we know that it is an impiety to condemn what is catholic. But if
you call this ‘other’ a heretic, you must also brand as a heretic the ‘other’ who will not admit
that souls existed and hoped in Christ before they were born in the body. Which way can
you get out of this dilemma, my master? Whither will you break forth? To what place will
you escape? Whichever way you betake yourself, you will stick fast. Not only is there no
avenue by which you can withdraw yourself; there is not even the least breathing space left
you. Is this all the profit you have gained from Alexander’s Commentaries on Aristotle, and
Porphyry’s Introduction? Is this the result of the training of all those great Philosophers by
whom you tell us you were educated, with all their learning, Greek and Latin, and Jewish
into the bargain? Have they ended by bringing you into these inextricable straits, in which
you are so pitifully confined that the very Alps could give you no refuge?</p>

<p>31 (a). But let us spare him now. We must bend to our examination of the books; for,
to use an expression of his own, a great work leaves no time for sleep; though indeed he
himself spares nobody, and does not so much use reasonable speech as lash with the scourge
of his tongue whomsoever he pleases; and any one who refuses to flatter him must expect
to be branded at once as a heretic both in his treatises and in hundreds of letters sent to all
parts of the world. Let us not follow his example, but rather that of the patriarch David,
who, when he had surprised his enemy Saul in the cave and might have slain him, refused
to do so, but spared him. This man knows well how often I have done the same by him,
both in word and deed; and if he does not choose to confess it, he has it fixed at least in his
mind and conscience. I will pardon him then, though he never pardons others, but condemns
men for their words without any consideration or charity; and for the present I will let him
come out from this pit, until he falls into that other, from which all of us together will be
unable to deliver him, however much we may wish and strive. He has to explain how it
comes to pass that, in the first passage, where that doctrine was being asserted which sought
to vindicate the justice of God, he really meant to speak of some one else, and that that
person was the one whom he now wishes to have condemned; yet in the second passage,
where the speaker says the opposite and does not admit what has been said before, the
‘other’ whom he speaks of means himself. It is possible that he may feel sure that this was
what he meant, but that he was not able to make it plain in writing. Let us give him the benefit
of the doubt, and assume that in this latter passage the ‘other’ is himself, and that it is
he who does not admit the doctrine which holds that before our life in the body began our
souls existed and hoped in Christ. I will quote the entire passage, and prosecute a fresh and
diligent inquiry to see what it tends to. He says thus:</p>
<p>“Another who does not admit this doctrine that before our life in the body began our
souls existed and trusted in Christ, changes the sense of the passage so as to mean that, in
the advent of our Lord and Saviour, when in his name2876 every knee shall bow, of things
heavenly and earthly and infernal, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father, when all things shall be made subject to him, there will be
some who are made subject willingly, but others only by necessity; and that those who before
his coming in his majesty have hoped in him will be to the praise of his glory; that these
therefore are called2877 Fore-hopers; but that those who are only found to believe through
necessity, when even the devil and his angels will be unable to reject Christ as King are to
be called simply Hopers, and that they are not for the praise of his glory. And this we see
partly fulfilled even now, since we can distinguish between the reward of those who follow
<note type="footnote">2876 Phil. ii. 10, 11</note>
<note type="footnote">2877 Jerome uses the Greek word προηλπίκοτας. It seems best to coin a new one to represent the peculiar

<pb n="1163"/>
God willingly and those who follow Him through necessity. But,2878 whether by pretence
or in truth, let Christ be proclaimed: only let each of them understand, both the Hopers and
the Fore-hopers, that for the difference of their hope they will receive different rewards.”</p>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">

<p>32. In this passage all room for doubt is removed. In the former passage you said that
those who before hoped in Christ are those who, before they were born in bodies in this
visible world, dwelt in heaven and had hope in Christ. But, to prevent this being supposed
to be your own doctrine, you introduced another interpretation, namely, that at that time
when every knee shall bow to Jesus as Lord, the universal creation, of things heavenly, earthly
and infernal, will consist of persons subjected to him in two different ways, some willingly,
some by necessity. You add that all the saints, who now believe on him through the word
of preaching are subject to him willingly, and that these are called Fore-hopers, that is those
who have beforehand hoped in Christ: but that those who are subject to him by necessity
are those who have not believed now through the preaching of the word, but who then will
no longer be able to deny him, such as the devil and his angels, and those who with them
have been obliged by necessity to believe: and that all these, and amongst them the devil
and his angels, who shall afterwards believe, shall not be called Fore-hopers, because that
name belongs to those who believed in Christ before, and hoped in him willingly, whereas
these others only did so afterward and by necessity: and you add that, consequently, they
will receive different rewards. But you assign rewards, though they may be inferior ones, to
all, even to those who now do not believe, that is, the devil and his angels; and, though now
you hold the mere opinion, not the mature judgment, of another worthy of condemnation
who thinks it possible that the devil may one day have a respite from punishment, you bring
him into the kingdom of God to receive the second reward. This also you wish us to understand,
that, as it matters not whether Christ is preached in truth or by necessity, so it is of
no consequence whether we believe by necessity or willingly.</p>

<p>33. These are the things which we learn from the Commentaries to which you direct
us. These are the rules for the confusion2879 of our faith which you teach us. You wish us
to condemn in others what you teach yourself in private. For, of course, if you are now that
‘other’ who do not admit the doctrine which holds that our souls existed in heaven before
they were joined to bodies, you are undoubtedly the man who not only promise pardon to
the devil and his angels and all unbelievers but also undertake that they shall be endowed
with rewards of the second order. But if you deny this second doctrine, you must be the
author of that which we first discussed. And I wonder that those able and learned men who
read these writings of his about which he now writes in commendation, should laugh at me
because he calls me a mole, and should not feel that he is all the while thinking of them
much more as moles, for not seeing that the things I have pointed out are imbedded in his
books. For, if he thought that they could understand as well as read, he would never have
requested them to get a copy of those books with a view to the condemnation of the very
things which their master there teaches; for these very things which he urges us to condemn
are most plainly and manifestly contained in them. I have shewn, at all events, that he
himself in these chosen Commentaries of his asserts the doctrines which he desires to have
condemned in another man’s books, namely, that souls existed in heaven before they were
born in bodies in this world, and that all sinners and unbelievers, together with the devil
and his angels, will, at the time when every knee shall bow to Jesus of things heavenly and
things earthly and things infernal, not only receive pardon, but also be summoned to receive
the second order of rewards.</p>

<p>34. It is indeed a thing so unheard of to believe that a man can pronounce condemnation
on the fabric which he himself has reared, that I doubt not it will with difficulty win credit;
and I feel that what you desire is that I should, if possible, produce from his writings instances
of this so clear that no room whatever may be left for doubting; that is, passages in which
that ‘other’ of which he is so fond is not named at all; and this I will do. In this same book
he declares his belief that, in the end of the age,2880 Christ and his saints will have their
throne above the demons in such a way that the demons themselves will act according to
the will of Christ and his saints who reign over them. In commenting upon the passage
where the Apostle says,2881 “That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches
of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus,” after a few other remarks, he says:</p>
<p>“We who formerly were held bound by the law of the infernal place, and, through our
vices and sins were given over both to the works of the flesh and to punishment, shall now
reign with Christ and sit together with him. But we shall sit, not in some kind of low place,
but2882 above all Principalities and power and Dominion, and every name that is named
not only in this age but in the age to come. For, if Christ has been raised from the dead, and
sits at the right hand of God in heavenly places, far above all Principality and Power and
Dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but in the age to come,
we also must of necessity sit and reign with Christ and sit above those things above which
he sits. But the careful reader will at this point make his inquiry and say: What? is man then
greater than the angels and all the powers of heaven? I make answer, though it is hazardous
to do so, that the Principalities and Powers and Mights and Dominions, and all names that
are named not only in this age but in that which is to come must refer (since all things are
subjected to the feet of Christ) not to the good part of them but the opposite; the Apostle
means by these expressions the rebellious angels, and the prince of this world, and Lucifer
who once was the morning star, over whom in the end of the age the saints must sit with
Christ, who communicates this privilege to them. These powers are now infernal powers,
abusing their freedom for the worst purposes, wandering everywhere and running together
down the steep places of sin. But when they have Christ and the saints sitting on thrones
above them, they will begin to be ruled according to the will of those who reign over them.”</p>
<p>Surely there is no ambiguity remaining here; the passage needs no one to bring out its
points. He says in the most distinct terms, without bringing in the person of any ‘other,’
that the rebellious angels and the prince of this world, and Lucifer who once was the
morning star, will in the end, when Christ sits and reigns over them with his saints, be fellows
and sharers, not only of his kingdom but also of his will; for to act according to the will of

Christ and of all his saints is to have arrived at the highest blessedness, and the perfection

<p>35. But I beg you to listen patiently as I follow him in his continual recurrence to these
same doctrines—not indeed in all that he says of them, for it is so much that I should have
to write many volumes if I tried to exhaust it—but as much as will satisfy the reader that it
is not by chance that he slips into these notions which he now proposes for imitation to his
disciples, but that he supports them by large and frequent assertion. Let us see what it is that
he teaches us in these the most approved of his Commentaries. In this same book he teaches
that there is for men the possibility of both rising and falling, not in the present age only
but in that which is to come. On the passage in which the words occur: “Far above all Principality
and Power and Might and Dominion, and every name that is named not only in
this age but in that which is to come,” he has the following among other remarks:</p>
<p>“If, however, there are Principalities, Virtues, Powers and Dominions, they must necessarily
have subjects who fear them and serve them and gain power from their strength; and
this gradation of offices will exist not only in the present age but in that which is to come;
and it must be possible that one may rise through these various stages of advancement and
honour, while another sinks, that there will be risings and fallings, and that our spirits may
pass under each of these Powers, Virtues, Principalities, and Dominions one after the other.”</p>

<p>36. I will address the Master in one of his own phrases.2883 Why, after nearly four
hundred years, do you give such teachings as these to the Latin people with their peaceable
and simple minds! Why do you inflict on unaccustomed ears new-sounding words, which
no one finds in the writings of the Apostles? I beseech you, spare the ears of the Romans,
spare that faith which the Apostle praised.2884 Why do you bring out in public what Peter
and Paul were unwilling to publish? Did not the Christian world exist without any of these
things until—not as you say I made my translations, but up to the time when you wrote
what I have quoted, that is till some fifteen years ago? For what is this teaching of yours,
that in the world to come there will still be risings and fallings,—that some will go forward
and some go back? If that be true, then what you say, that in this world life is either acquired
or lost, is not true; unless it has some occult meaning. I do not find that you repent of any
of these doctrines which these commentaries contain. Again, you teach that the Church is
to be understood as being one body made up not of men only but of angels and all the powers
of heaven. You say in commenting on the passage of the same book, in which the words
occur2885 “And gave him to be head over all the Church,” a little way down: “The Church
may be understood as consisting not of men alone, but also of angels, and of all the powers,
and reasonable creatures.” Again, you say that souls, because in that former life they knew
God, now know him not as one previously unknown, but as though after having forgotten
him they came to recognize him again. These are the words used in a passage of the same
book:</p>
<p>“The words which he uses “In the knowledge of him”2886 some interpret by recalling
that between γνωσις and ᾽επίγνωσις (Gnosis and Epignosis) that is, between knowing and
recognition there is this difference, that Knowing has reference to things which we did not
know before and have since begun to know, while Recognition has to do with those things
which we afterwards remember. Our souls, then, they say, have a kind of apprehension of
a former life, after they have been cast down into human bodies, and have forgotten God
their Father; but now we know him by revelation, according to that which is written:2887
“All the ends of this world shall remember and turn to the Lord;” and there are many similar
passages.”</p>

<p>38.2888 Now, as to the expression which he uses, “Some persons say,” I think it has been
made clear by what I have previously said, that, when he says “some persons say” or “Another
says,” and does not controvert the opinions which are thus introduced, it is he himself who
is this ‘certain’ or ‘other’ person. And this is proved by the numerous cases which I have
pointed out in which he expresses opinions agreeing with these without the introduction
of any such person. We must consider therefore in each case whether he expresses any dissent
from the ‘other.’ For instance, an opinion is put forward that the stars and the other things
that are in heaven are reasonable beings and capable of sinning. We must see, therefore,
what his own opinion is on this point. Turn to his note, in this book,2889 upon the passage
“He must reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.”2890 You will find, some way
down, the words:</p>
<p>“It may be observed that no one is without sin, that Even the stars are not clean in his
sight,2891 and Every creature trembles at the coming of the Creator. Hence it is not only
things on earth but also things in heaven which are said to have been cleansed by our Saviour’s
cross.”</p>
<p>Again, as to the opinion that it is because of their being in this body of humiliation or
body of death that men are called children of wrath, he says, in commenting on the words2892
‘We were the children of wrath, even as others.’ (Comm. on Ephes. on this verse, some way
down.)</p>
<p>“We must hold that men are by nature children of wrath because of this2893 ‘body of
humiliation’ and2894 ‘body of death,’ and because2895 ‘the heart of man is disposed to evil
from his youth.’”</p>
<p>Again, on the opinion that there is first a creation of the soul and afterwards a fashioning
of the body he says (at the same passage, a long way down)</p>
<p>“And observe carefully that he does not say, ‘We are his forming and fashioning, but2896
‘We are his making.’ For ‘fashioning’ implies the fact of man’s origin from the slime of the

earth: but ‘making’ from his origin according to the image and similitude of God. And this
distinction is confirmed by the words of the 118th Psalm2897 “Thy hands have made me
and fashioned me.” ‘Making’ has the first place, ‘fashioning’ comes after.’</p>
<p>Are there any other things which he wishes us to condemn? He has only to mention
them, and we can draw them out from his own books, or rather from the bottom of his own
heart. For instance. We are to condemn as a pestilent assertion that the nature of human
souls and of angels is the same. But let us see what his own opinion is on this point as given
in the books which he specially puts before us as containing the pattern of his profession
and his rule of faith. Turn to the passage,2898 “He came and preached peace to them which
were afar off and to them that were nigh.” His comment on this first expounds the words
of Jews and Gentiles, and then goes on:</p>
<p>“This has been said in accordance with the Vulgate2899 translation. But, if a man reads
the words of the Apostle when he says of Christ,2900 “Making peace through the blood of
his cross for those that are in earth and for those that are in heaven” and the rest that is said
in that place, he will not consider that it is we who are called the spiritual Israel are intended
by ‘those afar off,’ and that the Jews, who are merely called ‘Israel after the flesh’ are ‘those
who are nigh.’ He will modify the whole meaning of the passage, and apply it to the angels
and the heavenly powers and to human souls, and as implying that Christ by his blood
joined together things in earth and things in heaven which before were at variance, who
brought back the sheep which had grown sickly upon the mountains to be with the rest,
and put back the last piece of money among those which had before been safe.”</p>

<p>39. You observe how much difference he makes between the souls of men and the angels.
Merely the difference between the one sheep and the others, between one drachma and the
rest. But he adds something more, a little way further; he says:</p>
<p>“As to what the Apostle says, “That he might create in himself of two one new man, so
making peace,” though it seems to be even more applicable than the former passage to the
case of Jews and Gentiles, it may be adapted to our understanding of the passage in this way:
We may suppose him to mean that man, who was made after the image and similitude of
God, is after his reconciliation to receive the same form which the angels now have and he
has lost: and he calls him a new man because he is renewed day by day, and is to dwell in
the new world.”</p>
<p>The souls of men then, differ, according to him, from the angels as sheep from sheep
or as drachma from drachma; and men will have that form hereafter which the angels now
have, but which men once had and had lost. If then there is no difference between them in
nature, in shape or in form, I wonder that our learned man is not ashamed to condemn
another person for saying what he himself has said, and especially when you observe that
this is an exposition not of the Vulgate rendering but of the real meaning of the Apostle.
But see what is added further in the same place. He presently says:</p>
<p>“And the creation of the new man will be fully and completely perfected when things
in heaven and things in earth shall be joined in one, and we have access to the Father in one
spirit, in one feeling and mind. There is something similar suggested by Paul to all
thoughtful readers in another Epistle (though some do not receive it as his), in these
words:2901 “All these, having had witness borne of their faith, received not the promise,
God having provided some better thing for us, that apart from us they should not be made
perfect.” For this reason the whole creation2902 groans and travails with pain in sympathy
with us who groan in this tabernacle, who have conceived in the womb by the fear of God,2903
and are in grief and wait for the revelation of the sons of God; and it waits to be delivered
from the vanity of the bondage to which it is now subject; so that there may be one shepherd
and one flock, and that the petition in the Lord’s Prayer may be fulfilled, “Thy will be done
in earth as it is in heaven.””</p>
<p>We are to understand then that things in heaven and those on earth, that is, Angels and
men, formerly had one form and one sheepfold, and that so it will be in their future restoration,
since Christ will come to make both into one flock, and men are to be what angels

<pb n="1173"/>
now are, and what they, that is their souls, previously were. I ask then, with what face you
can mock, as we lately saw you, so pleasantly, or rather not pleasantly at all but scurrilously,
at those poor women who, striking their bellies and thighs, said that they should not after
the resurrection have those frail bodies but would be like the angels and have a life like
theirs. You reprove with bitter raillery these poor women for saying the very things which
are now produced as passages from these selected Commentaries of yours. Do not you think
this is somewhat as if a man were to accuse another of theft, while he had the very thing that
had been stolen concealed in the bosom of his toga; and as if, after inveighing against the
supposed thief in a long and magnificent peroration, after bringing forward witnesses and
taking the oath in due form, he should have the stolen article extracted from his toga which
he supposed himself to have convicted another of stealing.</p>
<p>There is another point. You find fault with others because, when questions are asked
them about such matters, they do not answer at once, but hesitate and use gestures rather
than words. Yet you say that the Apostle does much the same, at least, that he ‘insinuates’
something of this kind in his Epistle to thoughtful men. If Paul does not plainly declare
these things, but ‘insinuates’ them, and this not to everybody but only to thoughtful people,
why do you, whom we are bringing to see your errors, laugh at us poor creatures when we
say about things which the Apostle has not plainly declared either that we do not know, or
that we stand in doubt, and that, since we do not get a full understanding but a hint of his
meaning, we do not declare but suggest an explanation. If the things which eye hath not
seen nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man have been revealed
to you; if you have attained to that which is perfect, and that which is in part is done away
for you; shout aloud and proclaim the truth, and make quite plain the things which you say
the Apostle ‘insinuates,’ since not only what he insinuates but what he asserts, as you tell
us, now falls under your ban. All these things on which you now desire us to pronounce
anathema are those which you had ascribed to the Apostle in your exposition of his words,
and had taught as contained in the scope of his statements.</p>

<p>40. There are one or two more things on which he wishes condemnation to be passed.
One is this: that these men say that the body is a prison, and like a chain round the soul;
and that they assert that the soul does not depart, but returns to the place where it originally
was. Let me give quotations to show his opinion on this point also. In the second book of
these Commentaries, on the passage “For this cause, I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ,”
he says, a little way down;</p>
<p>“The Apostle in several passages calls the body the chain of the soul, because the soul
is kept shut up as it were in a prison; and thus we may speak of Paul being kept close in the
bonds of the body and does not return to be with Christ, so that preaching to the Gentiles
may be perfectly accomplished.”</p>
<p>And again in the third book of these Commentaries, on the words, “for which I am an
ambassador in chains,”2904 after some discussion of the passage, he speaks in the character
of that ‘other’ which is himself:</p>
<p>“Another contends that he speaks thus because of the2905 body of our humiliation and
the chain with which we are encompassed, so that we2906 know not yet as we ought to know,
and see2907 by means of a mirror in a riddle: and that he will be able to disclose the mysteries
of the Gospel only when he has cast off this chain and gone forth free from his prison. Yet
perhaps even in chains that man may be considered as free who has his conversation in
heaven, and of whom it may be said:2908 “You are not in the prison nor in the flesh, but in
the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you.”</p>
<p>And in the Commentary on Paul’s Epistle to Philemon, at the place where he says2909
“Epaphras my fellow-prisoner greeteth you,” some way down he says:</p>
<p>“Possibly, however, as some think, a more recondite and mysterious view is set before
us, namely, that the two companions had been captured and bound and brought down into
this vale of tears.”</p>

<p>41. You see how he represents these opinions as things which are held as a kind of esoteric
mystery by certain persons, of whom, however, he is one, as we have shewn over and
over again: only, he uses this figure of speech so that he may escape the imputations attached
to this mystic gnosis. You see, he will tell us, how the matter stands. You would never think
of attributing to me the opinion that all things are eventually to be restored to one condition,
and to be made up again into one body. I beg you not to impute this to me. If I say that an
opinion is another man’s, let it be another’s; if you afterwards find any opinion written down
without any ‘other’ person being thrown in, you will be right in ascribing it to me. What
then? are we to lose the fruit of all the trouble we have taken further back on this point?
Such is the power of effrontery. However, let it be as he chooses; I put aside the truth of the
matter and accept his own terms; but he will still be convicted. I will refer on the matter
now in hand to the second book of these Commentaries, at the passage2910 “Giving diligence
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one spirit, even
as ye were called in one hope of your calling.” After several remarks, he proceeds:</p>
<p>“The question arises how there can be one hope of our calling, when in the Father’s
house there are many mansions: to which we reply that the kingdom of heaven is the one
hope of our calling, as being the one house of our Father’s but that in one house there are
many mansions or rooms. For there is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, another
of the stars. But certainly it is possible that there is a deeper meaning, namely, that in the
consummation of the world, all things are to be restored to their primitive condition, and
that then we shall all be made one body, and formed anew into the perfect man, and that
thus the Saviour’s Prayer will be fulfilled in us,2911 ‘Father, grant that, as thou and I are one,
so they also may be one in us.’”</p>

<p>42. I have given you one instance in which he has expressed his own opinion without
any ambiguity on the universal resurrection. I will give one more, and with this bring to an
end the first book of my Apology. His statements, indeed, on this point are innumerable.
The one I select is on the passage where it is written:2912 “From whom all the body, fitly
framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth according to the working
in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up
of itself in love.” He begins thus:</p>
<p>“In the end of all things, when we shall have begun to know God face to face, and shall
have come to the measure of the age2913 of the fulness of Christ, of whose fulness we all
have received,2914 so that Christ will not be in us in part but wholly, and, leaving the rudiments
of babes, we shall have grown into the perfect man, of whom the Prophet says,2915
“Behold the man whose name is the East,” and whom John the Baptist announces in the
words:2916 “After me cometh a man who has come to be2917 before me, for he was before
me”; then by the concurrence in a common faith, and in a common recognition of the Son
of God, whom now through the variety of men’s minds we cannot know and recognize with
one and the same faith, the whole body, which before had been disintegrated and torn into
many parts, will be joined and fitted together, and brought into one; so that there will be
but one administration, and one and the same operation, and an absolute perfection of the
one age,2918 whereby the whole body will grow equally, and all its members according to
their measure will receive an increase of age. But this whole process of up-building, by which
the body of the church is increased in all its members, will be completed by mutual love.
We can understand the whole mass of rational creatures by the example of a single rational
animal; and whatever we say of the single creature, we may be sure will be applicable to
every creature. Let us imagine this creature, then, to have had all its limbs, veins and flesh
so torn apart that neither bone should cleave to bone nor muscle be joined to muscle, that
the eyes lie in one place apart, the nose in another, that the hands are placed here and the
feet thrown out there, and the rest of the members are in a similar way dispersed and divided.
Then let us suppose that a physician arrives on the spot, of such skill as to be able to imitate
the acts of Æsculapius, as told in the stories of the heathen, and to raise up a new form, the
new man Virbius.2919 It will be necessary for him to restore each member to its own place,

to couple joint to joint, and to replace the various parts and glue them together, so as to
make the body one again. So far this single comparison has carried us. But now let us take
another typical case, so as, by a similar illustration to make clear that which we wish to have
understood. A child is growing up; moment by moment, though the process is hidden from
us, he is tending to perfect maturity. His hands enlarge, his feet undergo a proportional increase;
the belly, though we cannot see it, is filled, the shoulders widen unmarked by the
eyes, and all the members in each part grow according to their measure, but in such a way
that they evidently increase not for themselves but for the body. So will it be in the time of
the restitution of all things, when the true physician Jesus Christ, shall come to restore to
health the whole body of the church which is now dispersed and torn. Every one, according
to the measure of his faith and his recognition of the Son of God (it is called recognition
because he first knew him and afterwards ceased from knowing him), will receive his
proper place, and will begin to be what he once had been: not that, according to another
opinion which is a heresy,2920 all will be placed in one condition,2921 that is, all restored to
the condition of Angels, but that every member will be perfected according to its measure
and office: for instance, that the apostate angel will begin to be that which he was originally
made, and man who had been cast out of the garden of Eden will be brought back to cultivate
the garden again. But all these things will be so constituted that they will be joined to one
another by mutual love, each member rejoicing with its fellow and being gladdened by its
advancement; and so the church of the first born, the body of Christ, will dwell in the
heavenly Jerusalem which the Apostle in another place calls the mother of the Saints.”</p>

<p>43. These things which you have said are read by all who know Latin, and you yourself
request them to read them: such sayings, I mean as these: that all rational creatures, as can
be imagined by taking a single rational animal as an example, are to be formed anew into
one body, just as if the members of a single man after being torn apart should be formed
anew by the art of Æsculapius into the same solid body as before: that there will be among
them as amongst the members of the body various offices, which you specify, but that the
body will be one, that is, of one nature: this one body made up of all things you call the original
church, and to this you give the name of the body of Christ; and further you say that
one member of this church will be the apostate angel, that is, of course, the devil, who is to
be formed anew into that which he was first created: that man in the same way, who is another
of the members, will be recalled to the culture of the garden of Eden as its original
husbandman. All those things you say one after the other, without bringing in the person
of that ‘other’ whom you usually introduce when you speak of such matters cautiously, and
like one treading warily, so as to make men think that you had some hesitation in deciding
matters so secret and abstruse. Origen indeed, the man whose disciple you do not deny that
you are, and whose betrayer you confess yourself to be, always did this, as we see, in dealing
with such matters. But you, as if you were the angel speaking by the mouth of Daniel or
Christ by that of Paul, give a curt and distinct opinion on each point, and declare to the ears
of mortals all the secrets of the ages to come. Then you speak thus to us: “O multitude of
the faithful, place no faith in any of the ancients. If Origen had some thoughts about the
more secret facts of the divine purposes, let none of you admit them. And similarly if one
of the Clements said any such things, whether he who was a disciple of the apostle or he of
the church of Alexandria who was the master of Origen himself; yes even if they were said
by the great Gregory of Pontus, a man of apostolic virtues, or by the other Gregory, of
Nazianzus, and Didymus the seeing2922 prophet, both of them my teachers, than whom the
world has possessed none more deeply taught in the faith of Christ. All these have erred as
Origen has erred; but let them be forgiven, for I too have erred at times, and I am now be-
having myself as a penitent, and ought to be forgiven. But Origen, since he said the same
things which I have said, shall receive no forgiveness though he has done penance; nay, for
saying the things which we all have said, he alone shall be condemned. He it is who has done
all the mischief; he who betrayed to us the secret of all that we say or write, of all which
makes us seem to speak learnedly, of all that was good in Greek but which we have made
bad in Latin. Of all these let no man listen to a single one. Accept those things alone which
you find in my Commentaries, and especially in those on the Epistle to the Ephesians, in
which I have most painfully confuted the doctrines of Origen. My researches have reached
<note type="footnote">2922 Didymus, the blind teacher of Alexandria. Jerome who admired him, though he was a disciple of Origen,
delights in calling him, in contrast to his blindness, the Seer.</note>

this result, that you must believe and hold the resurrection of the flesh in this sense that
men’s bodies will be turned into spirits and their wives into men; and that before the
foundation of the world souls existed in heaven, and thence, for reasons known to God
alone, were brought down into this valley of tears, and were inserted into this body of death;
that, in the end of the ages the whole of nature, being reasonable, will be fashioned again
into one body as it was in the beginning, that man will be recalled into Paradise, and the
apostate angel will be exalted above Peter and Paul, since they, being but men, must be
placed in the lower position of paradise, while he will be restored to be that which he was
originally created; and that all shall together make up the Church of the first born in heaven,
and, while placed each in his separate office, shall be equally members of Christ: but all of
them taken together will be the perfect body of Christ. Hold then to these things, my faithful
and discreet disciples, and guard them as my unhesitating definitions of truth; but for the
same doctrines pronounce your condemnation upon Origen; so you will do well. Fare ye
well.”</p>

<p>44. You do all this, you know well enough, laughing at us in your sleeve: and you profess
penitence merely to deceive those to whom you write. Even if your penitence is sincere, as
it should be, what is to become of all those souls who for so many years have been led astray
by this poisonous doctrine as you call it which you then professed. Besides, who will ever
mend his ways on account of your penitence, when that very document, in which you are
at once the penitent, the accuser and the judge, sends your readers back to those same doctrines
as those which they are to read and to hold. Lastly, even if these things were not so,
yet you yourself, after your penitence, have stopped up every avenue of forgiveness. You
say that Origen himself repented of these doctrines, and that he sent a document to that effect
to Fabian who was at that time Bishop of the city of Rome; and yet after this repentance of
his, and after he has been dead a hundred and fifty years, you drag him into court and call
for his condemnation. How is it possible then that you should receive forgiveness, even
though you repent, since he who before was penitent for emitting those doctrines gains no
forgiveness? He wrote just as you have written: he repented as you have repented. You ought
therefore either both of you to be absolved for your repentance, or, if you refuse forgiveness
to a penitent (which I do not desire to see you insist upon), to be both of you equally condemned.
There is a parable of the Gospel which illustrates this. A woman taken in adultery
was brought before our Lord by the Jews, so that they might see what judgment he would
pronounce according to the law. He, the merciful and pitying Lord, said: “He that is without
sin among you let him first cast a stone at her.” And then, it is said, they all departed. The
Jews, impious and unbelieving though they were, yet blushed through their own consciousness
of guilt;2923 since they were sinners, they would not appear publicly as executing vengeance
on sinners. And the robber upon the cross, said to the other robber who was hanging
like him on a cross, and was blaspheming, “Dost not thou fear God, seeing we are in the
same condemnation?” But we condemn in others the things of which we ourselves are
conscious; yet we neither blush like the Jews nor are softened like the robber.</p>

<p>In the first book of my Apology I have dealt with the accusations of dogmatic error
which he endeavours unjustly to fix upon others, and have, by producing his own testimony,
turned them back against him. In the second book, I shall be able, now that I have settled
and put aside the matters which have to do with controversies of faith, more confidently to
reply to him on the other heads of his accusation. For there is another and a very grave accusation,
which has, like the former, to be cut down by the scythe of truth. It is this. He
says2924 that certain persons have joined themselves to Origen in a secret society of perjury,
and that the forms of initiation are to be found in the Sixth book of his Miscellanies:2925
and that this mystery has been detected by no one but himself through all this space of time.
I should only excite his ridicule were I to declare, even with an oath, that I was an entire
stranger to such a secret society of perjury. The road by which I propose to reach the declaration
of the truth is more direct: it is by proving, which I can do quite easily, that I have
never possessed those books nor borrowed them from others to read. Not only cannot I
defend myself from an accusation the meaning of which I do not know, but I do not see
how a matter can be made the subject of a charge against me as to which I do not even know
what it is, or whether it exists at all. I only know that my accuser declares that either Origen
wrote or his disciples hold, that, when the Scripture says “He that speaketh truth with his
neighbour” the words apply to a neighbour only in the sense of one of the initiated, a
member of this secret society: and again that the Apostle’s words “We speak wisdom among
them that are perfect” and the words of Christ “Give not that which is holy unto dogs, neither
cast ye your pearls before swine,” imply that truth is not to be communicated to all.</p>

<p>2. Let us see what my adversary himself says on this point in those Commentaries which
he has selected. In the second book, in commenting on the words2926 “Wherefore, putting
away lying, speak every man truth to his neighbour, for we are members one of another”
(after a short introduction) he speaks as follows:</p>
<p>“Hence Paul himself, who was one of the perfect, says in another Epistle “We speak
wisdom among them that are perfect.”2927 This then is what is commanded, that those
mystic and secret things, which are full of divine truth, should be spoken by each man to
his neighbour, so that day unto day may utter speech and night to night shew knowledge,2928
that is, that a man should show all those clear and lucid truths which he knows to those to
whom the words can be worthily addressed: “Ye are the light of the world.”2929 On the
other hand, he should exhibit everything involved in darkness and wrapped up in the mist
of symbols to others who are themselves nothing but mist and darkness, those of whom it
is said “And there was darkness under his feet,”2930 that is, of course, under the feet of God.
For on Mount Sinai Moses enters into the whirlwind and the mist where God was; and it is
written of God, “He has made darkness his secret place.”2931 Let each man then thus speak
truth in a mystery to his neighbour, and not give that which is holy to dogs nor cast his
pearls before swine;2932 but those who are anointed with the oil of truth, them let him lead
into the bridechamber of the spouse, into the inner sanctuary of the King.”</p>
<p>Observe, I beg you, look carefully and see whether in all this passage there is any one
else but himself on whom the condemnation can fall. If his adversaries were looking for an
opportunity of convicting and destroying him on the ground of what he has written, what
other course could they take, and what other testimonies could they wish to produce against
him than these which he produces against himself as if he were pleading against another?
If it were sought to pronounce a condemnation against him, his own letter would suffice.
You have only to change the name; the test of the accusation suits no one but himself alone.
What he calls on us on the one hand to condemn, he exhorts us on the other hand to follow:
what he asserts, that he reproves: what he hates, that he does. How happy must be his disciples
who obey and imitate him!</p>

speaking to some of our brethren, and he repeats this by various letters, according to his
recognized plan of action. It is nothing to me what he may write or assert, but, since he
raises this question about a doctrine of perjury, I will state my opinion upon it, and then
leave him to pass judgment upon himself. It is this. Since our Lord and Saviour says in the
Gospels “It was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt pay to
the Lord thy vows, but I say unto you, Swear not at all;”2933 I say that every one who teaches
that for any cause whatever we may swear falsely, is alien from the faith of Christ and from
the unity of the catholic church.</p>

<p>4. But I should like, now that I have satisfied you on my own account, and supported
my opinion by an anathema, to make this plain to you further, that he himself declares that
in certain orgies and mystical societies to which he belongs perjury is practised by the votaries
and associates. That is a certain and most true saying of our God, “By their fruits ye shall
know them,”2934 and this also “A tree is known by its fruits.”2935 Well: he says that I have
accepted this doctrine of perjury. If then I have been trained to this practice, and this evil
tree has indeed its roots within me, it is impossible but that corresponding fruits should
have grown upon me, and also that I should have gathered some society of mystic associates
around me. As regards myself whom alone he seeks to injure by all that he writes, I will not
bear witness to myself, nor will I say that there are cases of necessity in which it is right to
swear: for I wish to avoid reproach through timidity if not through prudence; and, at all
events, if I fail in obedience to the command, I will acknowledge my error. I will therefore
make no boast of this. But, whether I have erred or acted prudently, he at all events can lay
his finger on no act of mine by which he can convict me. But I can shew from his writings,
that he not only holds this doctrine of perjury, but practises this foul vice as a sacred duty.
I will bring nothing against him which has been trumped up by ill will, as he does against
me; but I will produce him and his writings as witnesses against himself, so that it may be
made clear that it is not his enemies who accuse but he who convicts himself.</p>

<p>5. When he was living at Rome he wrote2936 a treatise on the preservation of virginity,
which all the pagans and enemies of God, all apostates and persecutors, and whoever else
hate the Christian name, vied with one another in copying out, because of the infamous
charges and foul reproaches which it contained against all orders and degrees among us,
against all who profess and call themselves Christians, in a word, against the universal
church; and also because this man declared that the crimes imputed to us by the Gentiles,
which were before supposed to be false were really true, and indeed that much worse things
were done by our people than those laid to their charge. First, he defames the virgins
themselves of whose virtue he professed to be writing, speaking of them in these words:2937</p>
<p>“Some of them change their dress and wear the costume of men, and are ashamed of
the sex in which they were born; they cut their hair short, and raise their heads with the
shameless stare of eunuchs. There are some who put on Cilician jackets,2938 and with hoods
made up into shape, make themselves like horned owls and night birds, as if they were becoming
babies again.”</p>
<p>There are a thousand such calumnies, and worse than these, in the book. He does not
even spare widows, for he says of them,2939 “They care for nothing but the belly and what
is next it;” and he adds many other obscene remarks of this kind. As to the whole race of
Solitaries, it would take too long to give the passages written by him in which he attacks
them with the foulest abuse. It would be a shame even to recount the indecent attacks which
he makes upon the Presbyters and the deacons. I will, however, give the beginning of this
violent invective, by which you may easily imagine what a point he reaches in its later
stages.2940</p>
<p>“There are some,” he says, “of my own order, who only seek the office of Presbyter or
deacon so that they may have more license to visit women. They care for nothing but to be
well dressed, to be well scented, to prevent their feet from being loose and bulging. Their
curly hair bears the mark of the crisping iron; their fingers sparkle with rings; and they walk
on tiptoe, for fear a fleck of mud from the road should touch their feet. When you see them,
you would take them for bridegrooms rather than clerics.”</p>
<p>He then goes on to hurl his reproaches against our priests and ministers, specifying
their faults, or rather their crimes; and to represent the access allowed them to married

<p>6. For I will now return, after a sort of digression, to the point I had proposed, and for
the sake of which it was necessary to mention this treatise. I will shew that perjury is looked
upon by him as lawful, to such a point that he does not care for its being detected in his
writings. In this same treatise he admonishes the reader that it is wrong to study secular
literature, and says,2941 “What has Horace to do with the Psaltery, or Virgil with the Gospels,
or Cicero with St. Paul? Will not your brother be offended if he sees you sitting at meat in
that idol’s temple?” And then, after more of the same kind, in which he declares that a
Christian must have nothing to do with the study of secular literature, he gives an account
of a revelation divinely made to him and filled with fearful threatenings upon the subject.
He reports that, after he had renounced the world, and had turned to God, he nevertheless
was held in a tight grip by his love of secular books, and found it hard to put away his
longing for them.2942</p>
<p>Suddenly I was caught up in the spirit and dragged before the judgment seat of the
Judge; and here the light was so bright, and those who stood around were so radiant, that I
cast myself upon the ground and did not dare to look up. Asked who and what I was I replied
‘I am a Christian.’ But He who presided said: ‘Thou liest; thou art a follower of Cicero and
not of Christ. For where thy treasure is there will thy heart be also.’ Instantly I became dumb,
and amid the strokes of the lash—for He had ordered me to be scourged—I was tortured
more severely still by the fire of conscience, considering with myself that verse ‘In the grave,
who shall give thee thanks?’ Yet for all that I began to cry and to bewail myself saying: ‘Have
mercy upon me, O Lord; have mercy upon me.’ Amid the sound of the scourges this cry
still made itself heard. At last the bystanders, falling down before the knees of Him who
presided, prayed that He would have pity on my youth, and that He would give me space
to repent of my error. He might still, they urged, inflict torture upon me, should I ever again
read the works of the Gentiles. Under the stress of that awful moment I should have been
ready to make even still larger promises than these. Accordingly I made oath and called
upon His name, saying ‘Lord, if ever again I possess worldly books, or if ever again I read
such, I have denied thee.’ On taking this oath, I was dismissed, and returned to the upper
world.</p>

<p>7. You observe how new and terrible a form of oath this is which he describes. The Lord
Jesus Christ sits on the tribunal as judge, the angels are assessors, and plead for him; and
there, in the intervals of scourgings and tortures, he swears that he will never again have by
him the works of heathen authors nor read them. Now look back over the work we are
dealing with, and tell me whether there is a single page of it in which he does not again declare
himself a Ciceronian, or in which he does not speak of ‘our Tully,’ ‘our Flaccus,’ ‘our
Maro.’2943 As to Chrysippus and Aristides, Empedocles and all the rest of the Greek writers,
he scatters their names around him like a vapour or halo, so as to impress his readers with
a sense of his learning and literary attainments. Amongst the rest, he boasts of having read
the books of Pythagoras. Many learned men, indeed, declare these books to be non-extant:
but he, in order that he may illustrate every part of his vow about heathen authors, declares
that he has read even those which do not exist in writing. In almost all his works he sets out
many more and longer quotations from these whom he calls ‘his own’ than from the
Prophets and Apostles who are ours. Even in the works which he addresses to girls and weak
women, who desire, as is right, only to be edified by teaching out of our Scriptures, he weaves
in illustrations from ‘his own’ Flaccus and Tullius and Maro.</p>

<p>8. Take the treatise which2944 he entitles “On the best mode of translating,” though
there is nothing in it except the addition of the title which is of the best, for all is of the worst;
and in which he proves those to be heretics with whom he is now in communion, thus incurring
the condemnation of our Apostle (not his, for those whom he calls ‘his’ are Flaccus
and Tully) who says, “He who judges2945 is condemned if he eat.” In that treatise, which
tells us that no works of any kind reasonably admit of a rendering word for word (though
he has come round now to think such rendering reasonable)2946 he inserts whole passages
from a work of Cicero.2947 But had he not said, “What has Horace to do with the Psalter,
or Maro with the Gospels, or Cicero with the Apostle? Will not your brother be offended if
he sees you sitting in that idol temple?” Here of course he brings himself in guilty of idolatry;
for if reading causes offence, much more does writing. But, since one who turns to idolatry
does not thereby become wholly and completely a heathen unless he first denies Christ, he
tells us that he said to Christ, as he sat on the judgment seat with his most exalted angel
ministers around him, “If I ever hereafter read or possess any heathen books, I have denied
thee,” and now he not only reads them and possesses them, not only copies them and collates
them, but inserts them among the words of Scripture itself, and in discourses intended for
the edification of the Church. What I say is well enough known to all who read his treatises,
and requires no proof. But it is just like a man who is trying to save himself from such a gulf
of sacrilege and perjury, to make up some excuse for himself, and to say, as he does: “I do
not now read them, I have a tenacious memory, so that I can quote various passages from
different writers without a break, and I now merely quote what I learned in my youth.” Well:
if some one were to ask me to prove that before the sun rose this morning there was night
over the earth, or that at sunset the sun had been shining all day, I should answer that, if a
man doubted about what all men knew, it was his business to shew cause for his doubts,
not for me to shew cause for my certainty. Still in this instance, where a man’s soul is at
stake, and the crime of perjury and of impious denial of Christ is alleged, a condemnation
must not be thought to be a thing of course, even though the facts are known and understood
by all men. We are not to imitate him who condemns the accused before they have undergone
any examination; and not only without a hearing, but without summoning them to appear;

and not only unsummoned, but when they are already dead; and not only the dead, but

Lord, who says2948 “Judge not and ye shall not be judged,” and again, “With what measure
ye mete it shall be measured to you again.” Therefore, though it is really superfluous, I will
bring against him a single witness, but one who must prevail, and whom he cannot challenge,
that is, once more, himself and his own writings. All can attest what I say in reference to
this treatise of his; and my assertion about it seems to be superfluous; but I must make use
of some special testimony, lest what I say should seem unsatisfactory to those who have not
read his works.</p>

<p>9. When he wrote his treatises against Jovinian, and some one had raised objections to
them, he was informed of these objections by Domnio, that old man whose memory we all
revere; and in his answer to him2949 he said that it was impossible that a man like him should
be in the wrong, since his knowledge extended to everything that could be known: and he
proceeded to enumerate the various kinds of syllogisms, and the whole art of learning and
of writing (of course supposing that the man who found fault with him knew nothing about
such things). He then goes on thus:2950</p>
<p>“It was foolish, it appears, in me to think that I could not know all these things without
the philosophers, and to look upon the end of the stylus which strikes out and corrects as
better than the end with which we write. It was useless for me it seems, to have translated2951
the Commentaries of Alexander, and for my learned master to have brought me into the
knowledge of Logic through the ‘Introduction’ of Porphyry; and, putting aside humanistic
teachers, there was no reason why I should have had Gregory Nazianzen and Didymus as
my teachers in the Scriptures.”</p>
<p>This, you observe, is the man who said to Christ, I have denied thee if ever I am found
to possess or to read the works of the heathen. He might, one would think, at all events have
left out Porphyry, who was Christ’s special enemy, who endeavoured as far as in him lay to
completely subvert the Christian religion, but whom he now glories in having had as his
instructor in his Introduction to Logic. He cannot put in the plea that he had learned these
things at a former time: for, before his conversion, he and I equally were wholly ignorant
of the Greek language and literature. All these things came after his oath, after that solemn
engagement had been made. It is of no use for us to argue in such a case. It will at once be
said to us: Man, you are wrong, God is not mocked, and no syllogisms spun out of the books
of Alexander will avail with him. I think, my brother, it was an ill-omened event that you
submitted to the Introduction of Porphyry. Into what has that faithless man introduced
you? If it is into the place where he is now, that is the place where there is weeping and
gnashing of teeth; for there dwell the apostate and the enemies of God; and perhaps the
perjurers will go there too.</p>

<p>10. You chose a bad introducer. If you will take my counsel, both you and I will by
preference turn to him who introduces us to the Father and who said2952 ‘No man cometh
unto the Father but by me.’ I lament for you, my brother, if you believe this; and if you believe
it not, I still lament that you hunt through all sorts of ancient and antiquated documents
for grounds for suspecting other men of perjury, while perjury, lasting and endless with all
its inexplicable impiety, remains upon your own lips. Might not these words of the Apostle
be rightly applied to you:2953 “Thou that art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest
thy boast in God, being instructed out of the law, and trustest that thou thyself art a leader
of the blind, a light of them that sit in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
babes, who hast a form of knowledge and of the truth in the law: Thou therefore, that teachest
others, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost
thou commit adultery? Thou that preachest that a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege”—that is perjury? And, what comes
last and most important, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
you,” and your love of strife.</p>

<p>8 (2). We will pass on to clear up another of the charges, if only he will confess under
the stress of his own consciousness of wrong that he has been convicted both of perjury and
of making a false defence. Otherwise, if he attempts to deny what I say, I can produce as
witnesses any number of my brethren, who, while living in the cells built by me on the
Mount of Olives, copied out for him most of the Dialogues of Cicero. I often, as they wrote
them out, had in my hands quaternions2954 of these Dialogues; and I looked them over
myself, in recognition of the fact that he gave them much larger pay than is usually given
for writings of other sorts. He himself also came to see me at Jerusalem from Bethlehem,
bringing with him a book which contained a single Dialogue of Cicero, and also one of
Plato’s in Greek; he will not pretend to deny having given me that book, and having stayed
some time with me. But what is the use of delaying so long over a matter which is clearer
than the light? To all that I have said this addition is to be made, after which all further
comment is superfluous; that after he had settled in the monastery at Bethlehem, and indeed
not so long ago, he took the office of a teacher in grammar, and explained ‘his own’ Maro
and the comedians and lyrical and historical writers to young boys who had been entrusted
to him that he might teach them the fear of the Lord: so that he actually became a teacher
and professor in the knowledge of those heathen authors, as to whom he had sworn that if
he even read them he would have denied Christ.</p>

<p>9 (2). But now let us look at the other points which he blames. He says that the doctrines
in question are of heathen origin, but in this judgment he condemns himself. He calls these
doctrines heathenish; yet he himself incorporates them into his works. He here makes a
mistake. Still, we ought to stretch out the hand to him, and not to press him too far: for it
is only because he soars so completely above the world on the wings of his eloquence, and
is borne along by the full tide of invective and vituperation that he forgets himself and his
reason loses its place. Do not be so rash, my brother, as to condemn yourself unnecessarily.
Neither you nor Origen are at once to be set down among the heathen if, as you have yourself
said, you have written these things to vindicate the justice of God, and to make answer to
those who say that everything is moved by chance or by fate: if, I say, it is from your wish
to show that God’s providence which governs all things is just that you have said the causes
of inequality have been acquired by each soul through the passions and feelings of the former
life which it had in heaven; or even if you said that it is in accordance with the character of
the Trinity, which is good and simple and unchangeable that every creature should in the
end of all things be restored to the state in which it was first created; and that this must be
after long punishment equal to the length of all the ages, which God inflicts on each creature
in the spirit not of one who is angry but of one who corrects, since he is not one who is extreme
to mark iniquity; and that, his design like a physician being to heal men, he will place
a term upon their punishment. Whether in this you spoke truly, let God judge; anyhow such
views seem to me to contain little of impiety against God, and nothing at all of heathenism,
especially if they were put forward with the desire and intention of finding some means by
which the justice of God might be vindicated.</p>

<p>10 (2). I would not, therefore, have you distress yourself overmuch about these points,
nor expose yourself needlessly either to penance or to condemnation. But there is a matter
of real importance, as to which I can neither excuse nor defend you; namely, a statement
openly made by you which is not only heathenish but beyond all heathenism and impiety—
the statement in the treatise which I have mentioned above,2955 that God has a motherin-
law. Has anything so profane as this or so impious been said even by any of the heathen
poets? It would be a foolish question to ask whether you find anything of the kind in the
holy Scriptures. I only ask whether ‘your’ Flaccus or Maro, whether Plautus or Terence, or
even whether any writer of Satires among all their unclean and immodest sayings has ever
uttered such an outrage against God. No doubt you were led astray by the fact that the girl
to whom you addressed the treatise2956 was called the bride of Christ: and hence you thought
that her mother according to the flesh might be called the mother-in-law of God. You did
not recollect that such things are said not according to the order of the flesh, but according
to the grace of the spirit. For a woman is called the bride of Christ because the word of God
is united in a kind of mystic wedlock with the human soul. But if the mother of the girl in
question is related to Christ by this spiritual connexion, she herself should be called the
bride of Christ, not the mother-in-law of God. As it is, you might as well go on to call the
father of the girl God’s father-in-law, and her sister his sister-in-law, or to call the girl herself
God’s daughter-in-law. The fact is, you were so anxious to appear completely possessed of
the eloquence of Plautus or of Cicero, that you forgot that the Apostle speaks of the whole
church, parents and children, mothers and daughters, brothers and sisters, all together, as
one virgin or bride, when he says,2957 “I determined this very thing, to present you as a
chaste virgin to one man, which is Christ.” But you boast that you follow not Paul’s but
Porphyry’s Introduction, and, since he wrote his impious and sacrilegious books against
Christ and against God, you have fallen, through his introduction, into this abyss of blasphemy.</p>

if you are not merely mocking us by saying this, and if you are not in your heart such a
lover of strife and contention that you are willing even to defame yourself on this sole condition
that you may be able thereby to besmirch another; if it is not in pretence but in good
faith that you repent of what you have said amiss, come and do penance for this great and
foul blasphemy; for it is indeed blasphemy against God. For if a man oversteps the mark by
speaking erroneously of mere creatures, this is not such a very execrable crime, especially
if he does it, as you say, not with a set purpose of blasphemy, but in seeking to vindicate the
justice of God. But to lift up your mouth against the heaven is a grave offence; to speak violence
and blasphemy against the Most High is worthy of death. Let us bestow our lamentations

<p>12. I think very little, indeed, of one reproach which he levels against me, and think it
hardly worthy of a reply; that, namely, in which, in recounting the various teachers whom
he hired, as he says, from the Jewish synagogue, he says, in order to give me a sharp prick,
“I have not been my own teacher, like some people,” meaning me of course, for he brings
the whole weight of his invective to bear against me from beginning to end. Indeed, I wonder
that he should have chosen to make a point of this, when he had a greater and easier matter
at hand by which to disparage me, namely this, that, though I stayed long among many
eminent teachers, yet I have nothing to show which is worthy of their teaching or their
training. He indeed, has not in his whole life stayed more than thirty days at Alexandria
where Didymus lived; yet almost all through his books he boasts, at length and at large, that
he was the pupil of Didymus the seer, that he had Didymus as his initiator,2959 that is, his
preceptor in the holy Scriptures; and the material for all this boasting was acquired in a
single month. But I, for the sake of God’s work, stayed six years, and again after an interval
for two more, where Didymus lived, of whom alone you boast, and where others lived who
were in no way inferior to him, but whom you did not know even by sight, Serapion and
Menites, men who are like brothers in life and character and learning; and Paul the old man,
who had been the pupil of Peter the Martyr; and, to come to the teachers of the desert, on
whom I attended frequently and earnestly, Macarius the disciple of Anthony, and the other
Macarius, and Isidore and Pambas, all of them friends of God, who taught me those things
which they themselves were learning from God. What material for boasting should I have
from all these men, if boasting were seemly or expedient! But the truth is, I blush even while
I weave together these past experiences, which I do with the intention, not of showing you,
as you put it, that my masters did not do justice to my talents, but, what I grieve over far
more, that my talents have not done justice to my masters.</p>
<p>But it is foolish in me to enumerate these holy Christian men. It is not of them that he
is thinking when he says that he has not like me been his own teacher. It is of Barabbas2960
whom, unlike me, he took as his teacher from the Synagogue, and of Porphyry by whose
introduction he and not I had his introduction into Logic. Pardon me for this that I have
preferred to be thought of as an unskilled and unlearned man rather than to be called the
disciple of Barabbas. For, when Christ and Barabbas were offered for our choice, I in my
simplicity made choice of Christ. You, it appears, are willing to join your shouts with those
who say,2961 “Not this man but Barabbas.” And I should like to know what Porphyry, that
friend of yours who wrote his blasphemous books against our religion, taught you? What

good did you get from either of those masters of whom you boast so much, the one drawing
his inspiration from the idols which represent demons, the other, as you tell us, from the
Synagogue of Satan. Nothing, as far as I see, but what they knew themselves. From Porphyry
you gained the art of speaking evil of Christians, to strike at those who live in virginity and
continence, at our deacons and presbyters, and to defame in your published writings, every
order and degree of Christians. From that other friend of yours, Barabbas, whom you chose
out of the synagogue rather than Christ, you learned to hope for a resurrection not in power
but in frailty, to love the letter which kills and hate the spirit which gives life, and other more
secret things, which, if occasion so require, shall afterwards in due time be brought to light.</p>

<p>13. But why should I prolong this discussion? I shall take no notice of his reproaches
and railings; I shall make no answer to his violent attacks, that daily task of his, for which
Porphyry sharpened his pen. For I have chosen Jesus, not Barabbas, for my master, and he
has taught me to be silent when reviled. I will come to the point where I will shew how much
truth there is in the excuses for himself and the accusations against me which he has heaped
together. He says2962 that it is only in two short Prefaces that he ever was known to have
praised Origen; and that his praise extended only to his work as an interpreter of Scripture,
in which nothing is said of doctrine or of the faith, and that in those parts of his works which
he has himself translated there is absolutely nothing advanced of the kind which he now
reproves in the interest of the Synagogue rather than that of the edification of Christians.
It ought, one would think, be enough to put him to silence, that those very things which he
set forth in his own books he blames in those of others; nevertheless, let us see how far these
other assertions of his are true. In the Preface2963 to the commentaries of Origen on Ezekiel,
contained in fourteen homilies or short orations, he writes thus to one Vincentius:</p>
<p>“It is a great thing which you ask of me, my friend, that I should translate Origen into
Latin, and present to the ears of Romans a man of whom we may say in the words of Didymus
the seer, that he was a teacher of the churches second only to the Apostles.”</p>
<p>And a little way on he adds:</p>
<p>“I will briefly state for your information that Origen’s works on the whole of Scripture
are of three kinds. First come the Extracts or Notes, called in Greek Scholia, in which he
shortly and summarily touches upon the things which seemed to him obscure or to present
some difficulty. The second kind is the Homiletics, of which the present commentary is a
specimen. The third kind is what he called Tomes, or as we say Volumes. In this part of his
work he gives all the sails of his genius to the breathing winds; and, drawing off from the
land, he sails away into mid ocean. I know that you wish that I should translate his writings
of all kinds. I have before mentioned the reason why this is impossible; but I promise you
this, that if, through your prayers, Jesus gives me back my health, I intend to translate, I will
not say all, for that would be rash, but very many of them; on this condition, however, which
I have often set you, that I should provide the words and you the secretary.”</p>

<p>14. Take, again, the Preface to the Song of Songs:</p>
<p>“To the most holy Pope Damasus. Origen in his other books has surpassed all other
men: in the Song of Songs he has surpassed himself. The work consists of eleven complete
volumes, and reaches a length of nearly twenty thousand lines. In these he discusses first
the version of the Septuagint; then those of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and last
of all a Fifth Version which he states that he discovered on the coast of Actium, and this he
does so grandly and so freely that it seems to me as if the words were fulfilled in him which
say,2964 “The king has brought me into his bedchamber.” It would require a vast amount
of time, of labour, and of money to translate a work so great and of so much merit into the
Latin language. I therefore leave it unattempted; and have merely translated, and that without
elegance, but correctly, these two Tracts which he composed in ordinary language for babes
and sucklings. I give you a mere taste of his opinions, not a full meal; but enough to make
you realize what is the worth of his greater works, when the smaller give you so much
pleasure.”</p>

Eustochium, he says, after some few remarks:</p>
<p>“As to what they say, that it is not right for me to rifle the works of Origen, and thereby
to defile the writings of the ancients, they think this a telling piece of abuse; but it is, in my
opinion, the highest praise, since I am seeking to imitate those who are approved not only
by us, but by all thoughtful men.”</p>

way down:</p>
<p>“For fear that, when the edifice has been completed, the last touch, so to speak, should
be wanting, I have explained the words and names of the New Testament, partly through a
wish to follow the steps of Origen, whom all but the ignorant acknowledge to have been the
greatest teacher of the churches next to the Apostles. Among the rest of the illustrious
monuments of his genius is the labour which he has bestowed upon this, desiring to complete
as a Christian what Philo as a Jew had left undone.”</p>

<p>“Ambrose, who supplied the paper, the money and the secretaries by the aid of which
our Adamantius2966 and Chalcenterus2967 completed his innumerable books, in a certain
letter written to the same person from Athens, declares that he never had a meal, when
Origen was present, without something being read, and that he never went to bed without
having some brother read aloud from the holy Scriptures. This he said he continued day
and night, so that prayer waited upon reading and reading upon prayer.”</p>

<p>18. Lastly, take the following from another letter to Marcella:</p>
<p>“The blessed Martyr Pamphilus, whose life Eusebius the Bishop of Cæsarea set forth in
some three volumes, wished to rival Demetrius Phalereus and Pisistratus, in his zeal to establish
a library of sacred books: he sought out all through the world representative works
of great minds, which are their true and everlasting monuments; but most of all he acquired
at great expense all the books written by Origen, and gave them to the church at Cæsarea.
This library was afterwards partly destroyed; but Acatius and later on Euzoius, Bishops of
that church, endeavoured to reestablish it in parchment volumes. The last of these recovered
a great many works, and left us an inventory of them, but he shews that he could not find
the Commentary on the hundred and twenty-sixth Psalm and the Tract on the Hebrew letter
Pe, by the fact that he does not mention it. Not that so great a man as Adamantius passed
over anything, but that, through the negligence of his successors it did not remain to times
within our memory.”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">     
<pb n="1207"/>
<p>19. But perhaps you will say to me: “Why do you fill your paper with this superfluous
matter? Does even my friend say that it is a crime to name Origen, or to give him praise for
his talents? If Origen is proclaimed as ‘such and so great a man,’ this makes us the more
anxious to be told whether he is in other passages spoken of as ‘an apostolic man,’ or ‘a
teacher of the churches,’ or by any similar expressions which appear to commend not only
his talents but his faith.” This then shall be done. It was indeed for this purpose that I produced
the passage where he speaks of him as ‘such and so great a man,’ because it was, if I
am not mistaken, in the Preface this laudatory expression is used about him that he also
claims the right of Origen to be called an Apostle or a Prophet, and to be praised even to
the heavens. And in the same way, if there are passages in which I happen to have praised
Origen’s learning, all my praise is just of this kind. This man rouses all this alarm in you
because of such expressions of mine; but he maintains that it is unjust to bring up similar
expressions against him when they occur in his own writings. But, since he does not choose
to stand on equal terms with us before the tribunal of opinion, but condemns us on mere
suspicion, while he himself does not hold himself bound even by his own handwriting; since
he, I say, does not think it necessary in such a matter to observe the rule of holy Scripture
which demands that each man should be judged without respect of persons; I will make
answer for myself, not according to the demands of justice, but according to his wishes. He
says to me: “If you have translated Origen, you are to be blamed; but I, even if I have said
the very things for which I blame him, have done well, and these ought to be read and held
as true. If you have praised his talents or his knowledge, you have committed a crime; if I
have praised his talents, it goes for nothing.”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">     
<pb n="1208"/>
<p>20. Well then; he says, “Give me an instance in which I have so praised him as to defend
his system of belief.” You have no right to ask this, I reply; yet I will follow where you lead.
There is a certain writing of his2968 in which he gives a short catalogue of the works which
Varro wrote for the Latins, and of those which Origen wrote in Greek for the Christians. In
this he says:</p>
<p>Antiquity marvels at Marcus Terentius Varro because of the countless books which he
wrote for Latin readers; and Greek writers are extravagant in their praise of their man of
brass, because he has written more works than one of us could so much as copy. But since
Latin ears would find a list of Greek writers tiresome, I shall confine myself to the Latin
Varro. I shall try to shew that we of to-day are sleeping the sleep of Epimenides and devoting
to the amassing of riches the energy which our predecessors gave to sound if secular learning.</p>
<p>Varro’s writings include forty-five books of antiquities, four concerning the life of the
Roman people.</p>
<p>But why, you ask me, have I thus mentioned Varro and the man of brass? Simply to
bring to your notice our Christian man of brass, or, rather, man of adamant—Origen, I
mean—whose zeal for the study of Scripture has fairly earned for him this latter name.
Would you learn what monuments of his genius he has left us? The following list exhibits
them. His writings comprise thirteen books on Genesis, two books of Mystical Homilies,
notes on Exodus, notes on Leviticus…also single books, four books on First Principles, two
books on the Resurrection, two dialogues on the same subject.</p>
<p>And, after enumerating all his works as if making an exact index, he added what follows:</p>
<p>“So you see the labours of this one man have surpassed those of all previous writers
both Greek and Latin. Who has ever managed to read all that he has written? Yet what reward
have his exertions brought him? He stands condemned by his bishop, Demetrius, only the
bishops of Palestine, Arabia, Phoenicia, and Achaia dissenting. Imperial Rome consents to
his condemnation, and even convenes a senate to censure him, not—as the rabid hounds
who now pursue him cry—because of the novelty or heterodoxy of his doctrines, but because
men could not tolerate the incomparable eloquence and knowledge, which, when once he
opened his lips, made others seem dumb.</p>
<p>I have written the above quickly and incautiously, by the light of a poor lantern. You
will see why, if you think of those who to-day represent Epicurus and Aristippus.</p>
<note type="footnote">2968 Letter xxxiii.</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24"> 
<pb n="1209"/>
<p>21. Now suppose that while you were writing this, as you tell us you did, quickly not
cautiously, by the poor glimmering light of a lantern, some Prophet had stood by you and
had cried out: “O writer, suppress those words, restrain your pen; for the time is coming
and is not far off when you will make a schism and separate yourself from the church; and,
in order that you may find a colorable excuse for this schism, you will begin to defame these
very books which you now make out to be so admirable. You will then say that the man
whom you call your own Brazen-heart,2969 and whose name you are just about to write
down as Adamantine because of the merit of his praise-worthy labours, did not write books
for the edification of the soul but venomous heresies. This man, further, whom you rightly
describe as not having been condemned by Demetrius on the ground of his belief, who you
say was not accused of bringing in strange doctrines, you will then pronounce worthy of
execration because of his strange doctrines; as to what you are writing about mad dogs
bringing feigned charges against him, you will yourself feign the same: and the Senate of
Rome as you call it, you will then stir up against him as you complain that they now do by
your letters of admonition, your vehement attestations, and satellites flying in all directions.
This is the return that you will make to your admirable Brazen-heart for all his labours.
Therefore beware how you write now, for, if you write as you are doing and afterwards act
as I have said, you will with more justice be condemned by your own judgment than he by
that of others.” Would you, do you think, have given credit to that prophet? Would you not
have thought it more likely that he was mad than that you would ever come to such a pass?
The fact is that in controversies of this kind there is no thought of sparing a friend if only
an enemy can be injured. But you go beyond even this point: you do not spare yourself in
your attempt to ruin not your enemies but your friends.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">     
<pb n="1210"/>
<p>22. In the Preface to his book on Hebrew Questions, after many other remarks, he says:</p>
<p>“I say nothing of Origen. His name (if I may compare small things to great) is even more
than my own the object of ill will, because though following the common version in his
Homilies which were spoken to common people, yet in his Tomes, that is, in his fuller discussion
of Scripture, he yields to the Hebrew as the truth, and though surrounded by his
own forces occasionally seeks the foreign tongue as his ally. I will only say this about him,
that I should gladly have his knowledge of the Scriptures even if accompanied with all the
ill-will which clings to his name, and that I do not care a straw for these shades and spectral
ghosts whose nature is said to be to chatter in dark corners and be a terror to babies.”</p>
<p>I really can no longer wonder or complain of his unfriendly dealings with me since he
has not spared ‘such men, such great men.’ For another man whom he tears to pieces is
Ambrose that Bishop of sacred memory. In what manner, and with what disparagement he
attacks him, I will show in a similar way from one of his Prefaces, in which, nevertheless,
he praises Origen. It is the Preface to Origen’s homilies on Luke addressed to Paula and
Eustochium.</p>
<p>A few days ago you told me that you had read some commentaries on Matthew and
Luke, of which one was equally dull in perception and expression, the other frivolous in
expression, sleepy in sense. Accordingly, you requested me to translate without such trifling,
our Adamantius’ 39 homilies on Luke, just as they are found in the original Greek: I replied
that it was an irksome task and a mental torment to write, as Cicero phrases it, with another
man’s heart, not one’s own: but yet I will undertake it as your requests reach no higher than
this. The demand which the sainted Blæsia once made at Rome, that I should translate into
our language his twenty-five volumes on Matthew, five on Luke and thirty-two on John is
beyond my powers, my leisure and my energy. You see what weight your influence and
wishes have with me. I have laid aside for a time my books on Hebrew Questions to use my
energies which your judgment holds fruitful in translating these commentaries which, good
or bad, are his work, and not mine: especially as I hear on the left of me the raven—that
ominous bird—croaking and mocking in an extraordinary way at the colours of all the
other birds, because of his own utter blackness. And so, before he change his note, I confess
that these treatises are Origen’s recreation no less than dice are a boy’s: very different are
the serious pursuits of his manhood and of his old age. If my proposal meet with your approbation,
if I am still able to undertake the task, and if the Lord grant me opportunity to
translate them into Latin, so that I may complete the work I have now deferred, you will
then be able to see, aye, and all who speak Latin will learn through you, the mass of valuable
knowledge of which they have hitherto been ignorant, but which they have now begun to
acquire. Besides this I have arranged to send you shortly the commentaries on Matthew of
that eloquent man Hilarius, and of the blessed martyr Victorinus, which, different as their

<pb n="1211"/>
style may be, one spirit has enabled them to write: these will give you some idea of the study
which our Latins also have in former days bestowed upon the Holy Scriptures.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">     
<pb n="1212"/>
<p>23. You see by this what his opinions are about Origen and also about Ambrose. If he
should deny that his strictures apply to Ambrose, which every one knows, he will be convicted
in the first place by the fact that there is a Commentary of his on Luke which is current
among the Latins, and none by any other hand. But secondly he knows that I possess a letter
of his in which, while he discharges others, he makes his strictures fall upon Ambrose. But,
since that letter contains certain more secret matters, I do not wish to see it published before
the right time; and therefore I will corroborate what I say by other proofs similar to it. In
the meantime let this be counted as demonstrated by what I have said above, that he extols
Origen’s writings as in every way admirable, and declares that ‘if he translates them, the
Roman tongue will then recognize what a store of good it had hitherto been ignorant of and
now has begun to understand,’ that is the twenty six books on Matthew, the five on Luke,
and the thirty two on John. These are the books to which he gives the highest honour; and
in these absolutely everything is to be found which is contained in the books on Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν,
the groundwork of his charges against me, only set forth with greater breadth and fulness.
If then he promises that he will translate these, why does he condemn me for a similar
course? But now I have undertaken to prove how violently he attacks a man who is worthy
of all admiration, Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, who was not to that church alone but to all
the churches like a column or an impregnable fortress. I will therefore set forth a Preface of
his by which you may see in what foul and unworthy terms he assails even a man of such
eminence, and also how he praises Didymus to the sky, though he has since cast him down
even to the infernal region; and further how he speaks of the city of Rome, which now
through the grace of God is reckoned by Christians as their capital, words which were only
applicable when its inhabitants were a nation who were heathens and princes who were
persecutors.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">     
<pb n="1213"/>
<p>24. The Preface is that for the treatise of Didymus on the Holy Spirit. It is addressed to
Paulinianus, and is as follows.</p>
<p>“While I was an inhabitant of Babylon, a settler in the land of the purple harlot, and
lived under the law of the Quirites, I attempted to write some poor stuff about the Holy
Spirit and dedicated the work to the Pontiff of that city. When on a sudden that pot which
Jeremiah saw after the almond rod2970 began to seethe from the face of the North; and the
whole senate of the Pharisees raised a clamour and no mere imaginary scribe but the whole
faction of the ignorant as if I had declared war against them, laid their heads together against
me. I therefore returned with all speed to Jerusalem, like a man going back to his home,
and, after having lived in sight of the cottage of Romulus and the Lupercal2971 with its naked
games, I am now in sight of Mary’s inn and the Saviour’s cave. And so, Paulinianus my dear
brother, since the aforenamed Pontiff Damasus, who had impelled me to undertake this
work, now sleeps in the Lord, it is here in Judea that I warble the song which I could not
sing in a strange land, provoked thereto by you and by Paula and Eustochium those handmaids
of Christ whom I revere, and aided by your prayers; for this land which bore the Saviour
is more august to me than that which bore the man who slew his brother.2972 I have
in the title ascribed the work to its true authors for I preferred to be known as the translator
of another man’s work than to imitate certain people and, like the ungainly jackdaw, deck
myself in another bird’s plumage. I read some time ago the treatise of a certain person on
the Holy Spirit, and I recognized then, according to the sentence of Terence,2973 bad things
in Latin taken from good things in Greek. There is nothing in it of close reasoning, nothing
downright and manly, such as draws us into assent even against our will, but all is flaccid
and soft, sleek and pretty, picked out with the rarest colours. But Didymus,2974 my own
Didymus, who has the eyes of the bride in the Song of Songs, those eyes which Jesus bade
us lift up upon the whitening fields, looks afar into the depths, and has once more given us
cause to call him, as is our wont, the Seer Prophet. Whoever reads the work will recognize
the plagiarisms of the Latins, and will despise the derivative streams, as soon as he begins
to drink at the fountain head. He is rude in speech, yet not in knowledge;2975 his very style

<p>25. You observe how he treats Ambrose. First, he calls him a crow and says that he is
black all over; then he calls him a jackdaw who decks himself in other birds’ showy feathers;
and then he rends him with his foul abuse, and declares that there is nothing manly in a
man whom God has singled out to be the glory of the churches of Christ, who has2976 spoken
of the testimonies of the Lord even in the sight of persecuting kings and has not been alarmed.
The saintly Ambrose wrote his book on the Holy Spirit not in words only but with his own
blood; for he offered his life-blood to his persecutors, and shed it within himself, although
God preserved his life for future labours. Suppose that he did follow some of the Greek
writers belonging to our Catholic body, and borrowed something from their writings, it
should hardly have been the first thought in your mind, (still less the object of such zealous
efforts as to make you set to work to translate the work of Didymus on the Holy Spirit,) to
blaze abroad what you call his plagiarisms, which were very possibly the result of a literary
necessity when he had to reply at once to some ravings of the heretics. Is this the fairness
of a Christian? Is it thus that we are to observe the injunction of the Apostle,2977 “Do
nothing through faction or through vain glory”? But I might turn the tables on you and
ask,2978 Thou that sayest that a man should not steal, dost thou steal? I might quote a fact
I have already mentioned, namely, that, a little before you wrote your commentary on Micah,
you had been accused of plagiarizing from Origen. And you did not deny it, but said: “What
they bring against me in violent abuse I accept as the highest praise; for I wish to imitate
the man whom we and all who are wise admire.” Your plagiarisms redound to your highest
praise; those of others make them crows and jackdaws in your estimation. If you act rightly
in imitating Origen whom you call second only to the Apostles, why do you sharply attack
another for following Didymus, whom nevertheless you point to by name as a Prophet and
an apostolic man? For myself I must not complain, since you abuse us all alike. First you
do not spare Ambrose, great and highly esteemed as he was; then the man of whom you
write that he was second only to the Apostles, and that all the wise admire him, and whom
you have praised up to the skies a thousand times over, not as you say in two, but in innumerable
places, this man who was before an Apostle, you now turn round and make a heretic.
Thirdly, this very Didymus whom you designate the Seer-Prophet, who has the eye of the
bride in the Song of Songs, and whom you call according to the meaning of his name2979
an Apostolic man, you now on the other hand criminate as a perverse teacher, and separate
him off with what you call your censor’s rod, into the communion of heretics. I do not know
whence you received this rod. I know that Christ once gave the keys to Peter: but what

<pb n="1216"/>
spirit it is who now dispenses these censors’ rods, it is for you to say. However, if you condemn
all those I have mentioned with the same mouth with which you once praised them,
I who in comparison of them am but like a flea, must not complain, I repeat, if now you
tear me to pieces, though once you praised me, and in your Chronicle2980 equalled me to
Florentius and Bonosus for the nobleness, as you said, of my life.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">

<p>26. There is also an astonishing action of his in relation to Melania, which I must not
pass by in silence because of the shame which those who hear it may feel. She was the
granddaughter of the Consul Marcellinus; and in these very Chronicles2981 he had narrated
how she was the first lady of the Roman nobility to visit Jerusalem; how she had left her son,
then a little child, behind her at Rome, and how the name of Thecla was given her on account
of her signal merit and virtue. But afterwards, when he found that some of his deeds were
disapproved by this lady through the stricter discipline of her life, he erased her name from
all the copies of his work.</p>
<p>It has been necessary for me to bring together the large number of passages which I
have adduced from his works, so as to put to the test the truth of his statement,2982 that it
is only in two short prefaces that he has made mention of Origen with praise, and that not
because of his faith but his talent; that he has praised in him the commentator not the doctrinal
teacher. I have actually brought forward ten.</p>

<pb n="1218"/>
<p>27. But there is danger of expanding my treatise too far and becoming burdensome to
the reader; it is sufficient that in the passages I have cited he speaks of Origen as almost an
Apostle and a teacher of the churches, and says that it is not because of his novel doctrines
as the mad dogs pretend that the senate of Rome is excited against him; that he follows him
because he himself and all the wise approve him; and all the other testimonies, adduced
from his prefaces which are inserted above. But, however these matters may stand, and
whatever your relations may be to these writers whether ancient or modern, and whether
you call them Apostles or mere wantons,2983 Prophets or perverse teachers, what is that to
me? It is for you to do penance for all your changes of opinion, your violent words and the
wounds you have inflicted on good men, whether you have yet done so or not. As for myself,
what is the meaning of your saying “If they have followed me when I erred, let them follow
me also in my amendment?” Get thee behind me! Far be such a thing from me. I never followed
you or any other man in your errors, but in the strength of Christ I will follow, not
you nor any other man, but the Catholic church. But you, who have written all these things
who have followed those whom you knew to be in error, you who, as I have shewn, have
written so unworthily of God, go you, I say, and do penance, if at least you have any hope
that your crime of blasphemy can be pardoned.</p>

<p>27 a. I ask whether you can produce anything which I have written, by which you may
convict me of having fallen into heresy even in my youth,—anything of such a character as
the heresies of which, though you will not confess it, you now stand convicted. I said that I
had followed or imitated you in your system of translating, in that alone and in nothing
else. Yet you say that by this I have done you all the injury which you complain of. I followed
you in such things as I saw that you had done in the Homilies on the Gospel according to
Luke. Take the passage: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
my Saviour.” When you found that the Greek Commentary had something relating to the
Son of God which was not right, you passed it over; whereas the words about the Spirit,
which as you may remember, are expressed in the ordinary way, you not only did not pass
over but added a few words of your own to make the expression more clear. And so in the
note on the words,2984 “Behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into my ears, the
babe leaped in my womb,” you render: “Because this was not the beginning of his substance,”
and you add of your own the words “and nature,” though both these and a thousand other
things in your translations of these homilies or those on Isaiah or Jeremiah, but more particularly
in those on Ezekiel, you have now withdrawn. But, in certain places where you
found things relating to the faith, that is the Trinity, expressed in a strange manner, you left
out words at your discretion. This mode of translation we have both of us observed, and if
any one finds fault with it, it is you who ought to make answer, since you made use of it
before me. But now the practice which you blame is undoubtedly one for which you may
yourself incur blame. The practice of translating word for word you formerly pronounced
to be both foolish and injurious. In this I followed you. You can hardly mean that I am to
repent of this because you have now changed your opinion, and say that you have translated
the present work with literal exactness. In previous cases you took out what was unedifying
in matters of faith, though you did so in such a way as not to excise them wholly nor in all
cases. For instance, in the Homilies on Isaiah, at the Vision of God2985 Origen refers the
words to the Son and the Holy Spirit; and so you have translated, adding, however, words
of your own which would make the passage have a more acceptable sense. It stands thus:
“Who are then these two Seraphim? My Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit:” but you add
of your own, “And do not think that there is any difference in the nature of the Trinity,
when the functions indicated by the several persons are preserved.” The same thing I have
done in a great many cases, either cutting out words or bending them into a sounder
meaning. For this you bid me do penance. I do not think that you are of this opinion as regards
yourself. If then on this ground no penitence is due from either of us, what other
things are there of which you invite me to repent?</p>

<p>28. I repeat that there are no writings of mine in which there is any error to be corrected.
There are many of yours which, as I have shewn, according to your present opinion, ought
to be wholly condemned. You made an exception in favour of the Commentaries on the
Ephesians, in which you imagined that you had written more correctly. But even you must
have seen, as I have shewn, how like they are all through to Origen’s views; and, indeed,
how they contain something more extreme than the views of which you demand the con-
demnation. And, were it not that you had cut yourself off from the power of repentance by
saying “Read over my Commentaries on the Ep. to the Ephesians, and you will acknowledge
that I have opposed the doctrines of Origen;” possibly you might wish to turn round and
do penance for those, and in this case, as in the rest, to condemn yourself. As far as I am
concerned, I give you full leave to repent of these also; indeed, the best thing that you can
do is to do penance for all that you have said and also for all that you are going to say; for
it is certain that all that you have ever written is to be repented of. But if any one blame me
for having translated anything at all of Origen’s, then I say that I am the last of many who
have done the deed, and the blame, if any, should begin with the first. But does any one ever
punish a deed the doing of which he had not previously forbidden. We did what was permissible.
If there is to be a new law, it holds good only for the future. But it may be said that
the works themselves ought to be condemned and their author as well. If that be so, what
is to happen to the other author who writes the same things, as I have shewn most fully
above? He must receive a similar judgment. I do not ask for this nor press for it, although
he acts a hostile part towards me. But I cannot but see that he is heaping up such a judgment
for himself by his rash condemnation of others.</p>

<p>29. But I must deal with you once more by quoting your own words. You say of me in
that invective of yours2986 that I have by my translation shewn that Origen is a heretic while
I was a Catholic. The words are: “That is to say, I am a Catholic, but he whom I was translating
is a heretic.” Yes you say it, I have read it. Well then, if, as you tell us, the result of my
whole work is to show that I am a Catholic and Origen a heretic, what more do you want?
Is not your whole object gained if Origen is proved a heretic and I a Catholic? If you bear
witness that I have said this and have thus given you satisfaction by the whole of my work,
what cause of accusation against me remains? What purpose was served by that Invective
of yours against me? If I proved Origen to be a heretic and myself a Catholic, was I right or
not? If I was, then why do you subject to blame and accusation what was rightly done? But,
if it was not right that Origen should be called a heretic, why do you make a charge against
me on that head? What need was there for you to translate in a worse sense what I had
already translated according to your principles, though in a less elegant style? Especially
what need was there for you to play your readers false, and, when they expected one thing,
for you to do another? They imagine that you are acting in opposition to those who defend
Origen as Catholic; but the person whom you combat and accuse is the man who you say
has pronounced him a heretic. Perhaps it was for this that you invited me to do penance;
and I had misunderstood you. But even of this I must say that I could not repent, if my repentance
implied that I thought all things which are found in his works are catholic.
Whether what is uncatholic is his own or, as I think, inserted by others, God only knows:
at all events these things, when brought to the standard of the faith and of truth are wholly
rejected by me. What then is it that you want me to say? That Origen is a heretic? That is
what you say that I have done, and you blame it. That he is a catholic then? Again you make
this a ground of accusation against me. Point out more clearly what you mean; possibly
there is something which you can find out that lies between the two. This is all the wit that
you have gathered from the acuteness of Alexander and Porphyry and Aristotle himself:
This is the issue of all the boasting which you make of having from infancy to old age been
versed and trained in the schools of rhetoric and philosophy, that you set forth with the intention
of pronouncing sentence on Origen as a heretic, and in the very speech in which
you are delivering judgment turn upon the man whom you are addressing and accuse him
because he also has shown Origen to be a heretic. I beg all men to note that there is in all
this no care for the faith or for truth, no earnest thought of religion and sound judgment;
there is nothing but the practised lust of evil speaking and accusing the brethren which
works in his tongue, nothing but rivalry with his fellow men in his heart, nothing but malice
and envy in his mind. So much is this the case that, before any cause of ill feeling existed,
and I spoke of you with praise as my brother and colleague, you nevertheless were angry at
<note type="footnote">2986 Namely, Ep. lxxxiv. c. 7.</note>

<pb n="1222"/>
my advances. Forgive me for not knowing that you were what the Greeks call acatonomastos
(ακατονόμαστος), one whom no one dares to address by name. Still, I wonder that you
should call upon me to condemn what you complain of me for branding as wrong.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">

<p>30. It seems needless to make any answer to that part of his indictment in which he says
that the works of the Martyr Pamphilus, expressed as they are with so much faithfulness
and piety, are either not to be considered genuine or if genuine, to be treated with contempt.
Is there any one to whose authority he will bow? Is there any one whom he will refrain from
abusing? All the old Greek writers of the church, according to him, have erred. As to the
Latins, how he disparages them, how he attacks them one by one, both those of the old and
those of modern times, any one who reads his various work knows well. Now even the
Martyrs fail to gain any respect from him. “I do not believe,” he says “that this is really the
work of the Martyr.” If such an argument were admitted in the case of the works of any
writer, how can we prove their genuineness in any particular case? If I were to say, It is not
true that books of Miscellanies are Origen’s as you maintain, how can they be proved to be
his? His answer is, From their likeness to the rest. But, just as, when a man wants to forge
some one’s signature, he imitates his handwriting, so he who wishes to introduce his own
thoughts under another man’s name, is sure to imitate the style of him whose name he has
assumed. But, to pass over for brevity’s sake all that might with great justice be said on this
point, if you were determined to be so bold as to question the works of the Martyr, you
ought to have brought out publicly the actual statements which seemed to you liable to
question, and then every reader could have seen what was absurd in them and what was
reasonable, what was unsuitable to or against the system of the Apostles; and especially the
great impiety, whatever it may have been, in expiation of which you tell us that the Martyr
shed his blood. A man who read those actual words would be able to say, not, as now, on
your judgment but on his own, either that the martyr had gone wrong, or that a treatise
which was so full of absurdity and unbelief had been composed by some one else. But, as it
is, you know well that if the writings which you impugn are read by any one, the blame will
be turned back upon him who has unjustly found fault; and therefore you do not cite the
passages which you impugn, but with that ‘censor’s rod’ of yours, and by your own arrogant
authority, you make your decrees in this style: “Let this book be cast out of the libraries, let
that book be retained; and again, if today a book is accepted, tomorrow if any one but myself
has praised it, let it be cast out, and with it the man who praised it. Let this one be counted
as Catholic, even though he seems at times to have gone wrong; let that man have no pardon
for his error, even though he has said the same things as myself, and let no man translate
him nor read him, for fear he should recognize my plagiarisms. This man indeed was a
heretic, but he was my master. And this other, though he is a Jew, and of the Synagogue of
Satan, and is hired to sell words for gain, yet he is my master who must be preferred to all
others, because it is among the Jews alone that the truth of the Scriptures dwells.” If the
universal Church had with one voice conferred on you this authority, and had demanded
of you that you should be the judge of each and all, would it not have been your duty to refuse
to allow so heavy and perilous a burden to be laid upon you? But now we have made such

<pb n="1224"/>
progress in the daily habit of disparaging others that we no longer spare even the martyrs.
But let us suppose that the work is not that of the martyr Pamphilus, but of some other unknown
member of the church; did he, whoever he may have been, employ his own words,
I ask, so that we are called upon to defer to the merits of the writer? No. He sets out quotations
from the works of Origen himself, and exhibits his opinion upon each question not in the
words of the apologist but in those of the accused himself; and, just as in the present treatise
what I have quoted from your writings carried much more force than what I have said myself,
so also the defence of Origen lies not in the authority of his apologist, but in his own words.
The question of authorship is superfluous, when the defence is so conducted as to dispense
with the author’s aid.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">     
<pb n="1225"/>
<p>31. But I must come to that head of his inculpation of me which is most injurious and
full of ill-will; nay, not of ill-will only but of malice. He says: Which of all the wise and holy
men before us has dared to attempt the translation of these books which you have translated?
I myself, he adds, though asked by many to do it, have always refused. But the fact is, the
excuse to be made for those holy men is easy enough; for it by no means follows because a
man of Latin race is a holy and a wise man, that he has an adequate knowledge of the Greek
language; it is no slur upon his holiness that he is wanting in the knowledge of a foreign
tongue. And further, if he has the knowledge of the Greek language, it does not follow that
he has the wish to make translations. Even if he has such a wish, we are not to find fault
with him for not translating more than a few works, and for translating some rather than
others. Every man has power to do as he likes in such matters according to his own free will
or according to the wish of any one who asks him to make the translation. But he brings
forward the case of the saintly men Hilary and Victorinus, the first of whom, though wellknown
as a commentator, translated nothing, I believe, from the Greek; while the other
himself tells us that he employed a learned presbyter named Heliodorus to draw what he
needed from the Greek sources, while he himself merely gave them their Latin form because
he knew little or nothing of Greek. There is therefore a very good reason why these men
should not have made this translation. That you should have acted in the same way is, I
admit, a matter for wonder. For what further audacity, what larger amount of rashness,
would have been required to translate those books of Origen, after you had put almost the
whole of their contents into your other works, and, indeed, had already published in books
bearing your own name all that is said in those which you now declare worthy of blame?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">     
<pb n="1226"/>
<p>32. Perhaps it was a greater piece of audacity to alter the books of the divine Scriptures
which had been delivered to the Churches of Christ by the Apostles to be a complete record
of their faith by making a new translation under the influence of the Jews. Which of these
two things appears to you to be the less legitimate? As to the sayings of Origen, if we agree
with them, we agree with them as the sayings of a man; if we disagree, we can easily disregard
them as those of a mere man. But how are we to regard those translations of yours which
you are now sending about everywhere, through our churches and monasteries, through
all our cities and walled towns? are they to be treated as human or divine? And what are we
to do when we are told that the books which bear the names of the Hebrew Prophets and
lawgivers are to be had from you in a truer form than that which was approved by the
Apostles? How, I ask, is this mistake to be set right, or rather, how is this crime to be expiated?
We hold it a thing worthy of condemnation that a man should have put forth some strange
opinions in the interpretation of the law of God; but to pervert the law itself and make it
different from that which the Apostles handed down to us,—how many times over must
this be pronounced worthy of condemnation? To the daring temerity of this act we may
much more justly apply your words: “Which of all the wise and holy men who have gone
before you has dared to put his hand to that work?” Which of them would have presumed
thus to profane the book of God, and the sacred words of the Holy Spirit? Who but you
would have laid hands upon the divine gift and the inheritance of the Apostles?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">     
<pb n="1227"/>
<p>33. There has been from the first in the churches of God, and especially in that of Jerusalem,
a plentiful supply of men who being born Jews have become Christians; and their
perfect acquaintance with both languages and their sufficient knowledge of the law is shewn
by their administration of the pontifical office. In all this abundance of learned men, has
there been one who has dared to make havoc of the divine record handed down to the
Churches by the Apostles and the deposit of the Holy Spirit? For what can we call it but
havoc, when some parts of it are transformed, and this is called the correction of an error?
For instance, the whole of the history of Susanna, which gave a lesson of chastity to the
churches of God, has by him been cut out, thrown aside and dismissed. The hymn of the
three children, which is regularly sung on festivals in the Church of God, he has wholly
erased from the place where it stood. But why should I enumerate these cases one by one,
when their number cannot be estimated? This, however, cannot be passed over. The seventy
translators, each in their separate cells, produced a version couched in consonant and
identical words, under the inspiration, as we cannot doubt, of the Holy Spirit; and this version
must certainly be of more authority with us than a translation made by a single man under
the inspiration of Barabbas. But, putting this aside, I beg you to listen, for example, to this
as an instance of what we mean. Peter was for twenty-four years Bishop of the Church of
Rome. We cannot doubt that, amongst other things necessary for the instruction of the
church, he himself delivered to them the treasury of the sacred books, which, no doubt, had
even then begun to be read under his presidency and teaching. What are we to say then?
Did Peter the Apostle of Christ deceive the church and deliver to them books which were
false and contained nothing of truth? Are we to believe that he knew that the Jews possessed
what was true, and yet determined that the Christians should have what was false? But perhaps
the answer will be made that Peter was illiterate, and that, though he knew that the
books of the Jews were truer than those which existed in the church, yet he could not
translate them into Latin because of his linguistic incapacity. What then! Was the tongue
of fire given by the Holy Spirit from heaven of no avail to him? Did not the Apostles speak
in all languages?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">     
<pb n="1228"/>
<p>34. But let us grant that the Apostle Peter was unable to do what our friend has lately
done. Was Paul illiterate? we ask; He who was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, touching the law
a Pharisee, brought up at the feet of Gamaliel? Could not he, when he was at Rome, have
supplied any deficiencies of Peter? Is it conceivable that they, who prescribed to their disciples
that they should give attention to reading,2987 did not give them correct and true reading?
These men who bid us not attend to Jewish fables and genealogies, which minister questioning
rather than edification; and who, again, bid us beware of, and specially watch, those of the
circumcision; is it conceivable that they could not foresee through the Spirit that a time
would come, after nearly four hundred years, when the church would find out that the
Apostles had not delivered to them the truth of the old Testament, and would send an embassy
to those whom the apostles spoke of as the circumcision, begging and beseeching
them to dole out to them some small portion of the truth which was in their possession:
and that the Church would through this embassy confess that she had been for all those
four hundred years in error; that she had indeed been called by the Apostles from among
the Gentiles to be the bride of Christ, but that they had not decked her with a necklace of
genuine jewels; that she had fondly thought that they were precious stones, but now had
found out that those were not true gems which the Apostles had put upon her, so that she
felt ashamed to go forth in public decked in false instead of true jewels, and that she therefore
begged that they would send her Barabbas, even him whom she had once rejected to be
married to Christ, so that in conjunction with one man chosen from among her own people,
he might restore to her the true ornaments with which the Apostles had failed to furnish
her.</p>

<p>35. What wonder is there then that he should tear me to pieces, being as I am of no account;
or that he should wound Ambrose, or find fault with Hilary, Lactantius and Didymus?
I must not greatly grieve over any injury of my own in the fact that he has attempted to do
my work of translating over again, when he is only treating me with the same contempt
with which he has treated the Seventy translators. But this emendation of the Seventy, what
are we to think of it? Is it not evident, how greatly the grounds for the heathens’ unbelief
have been increased by this proceeding? For they take notice of what is going on amongst
us. They know that our law has been amended, or at least changed; and do you suppose they
do not say among themselves, “These people are wandering at random, they have no fixed
truth among them, for you see how they make amendments and corrections in their laws
whenever they please,” and indeed it is evident that there must have been previous error
where amendment has supervened, and that things which undergo change at the hand of
man cannot possibly be divine. This has been the present which you have made us with
your excess of wisdom, that we are all judged even by the heathen as lacking in wisdom. I
reject the wisdom which Peter and Paul did not teach. I will have nothing to do with a truth
which the Apostles have not approved. These are your own words:2988 “The ears of simple
men among the Latins ought not after four hundred years to be molested by the sound of
new doctrines.” Now you are yourself saying: “Every one has been under a mistake who
thought that Susanna had afforded an example of chastity to both the married and the unmarried.
It is not true. And every one who thought that the boy Daniel was filled with the
Holy Spirit and convicted the adulterous old men, was under a mistake. That also was not
true. And every congregation throughout the universe, whether of those who are in the body
or of those who have departed to be with the Lord, even though they were holy martyrs or
confessors, all who have sung the Hymn of the three children have been in error, and have
sung what is false. Now therefore after four hundred years the truth of the law comes forth
for us, it has been bought with money from the Synagogue. When the world has grown old
and all things are hastening to their end, let us change the inscriptions upon the tombs of
the ancients, so that it may be known by those who had read the story otherwise, that it was
not a gourd2989 but an ivy plant under whose shade Jonah rested; and that, when our legislator
pleases, it will no longer be the shade of ivy but of some other plant.</p>
<note type="footnote">2988 Jer. Letter lxxxiv. c. 8.</note>

<p>36. But Origen also, you will tell us, in composing his work called the Hexapla, adopted
the asterisks,2990 taking them from the translation of Theodotion. How is this? You produce
Origen sometimes for condemnation, sometimes for imitation, at your own caprice. But
can it be admitted as right that you should bring in the same man as your advocate whom
just now you were accusing? Can you take as an authority for your actions one whom you
yourself have previously condemned, and to the condemnation of whom you stirred up the
Roman senate? You ought to have made provision for this beforehand. No man begins by
cutting the trunk of a tree when he is intending to lean against it; and no man first impugns
the faith of another and then invokes his faith in his own defence. Whether Origen did as
you say or not, makes no difference to you. If you wish that his case should be a precedent
for yours, read over your judgment upon him, and see what you have said. You used the
expression: “This is not clearing yourself but only seeking abettors of your crime.” Apply
this to yourself; your business is not to seek abettors of your crime, but to find means of
justification for your conduct. However, let us see whether anything of the kind was done
by Origen whom you make both plaintiff and defendant. I do not find a single passage which
he translated from the Hebrew. How then can your action and his be said to be alike? What
he did was this. He proved that apostates and Jews had translated the writings which the
Jews specially read: and, since it would frequently happen in the course of discussion that
they falsely asserted that some things had been taken out and others put in in our copies of
the Scriptures, Origen desired to shew to our people what reading obtained among the Jews.
He therefore wrote out each of their versions in separate pages or columns, and pointed out
by means of certain specified marks at the head of each line what had been added or subtracted
by them; and he merely put these marks of his in the work of others, not in his own; so
that we might understand not what we ourselves but what the Jews believed to have been
either removed or inserted. This was no more than what is done in the army when a list is
made out containing the names of the soldiers. If the captain wishes to see how many of
them have survived after an action, he sends a man to make inquiry; and he makes his own
mark, a (θ) (theta), for instance, as is commonly done, against the name of each soldier who
has fallen, and puts some other mark of his own to designate the survivors. Do you suppose
that he who makes one mark against the name of a dead man and another of his own against
that of a survivor, will be thought to have done anything which causes the one to be dead
and the other to be alive? He has only, as is well understood, marked the names of those
who have been killed by others, so as to call attention to the fact. Just in the same way, Origen
pointed out by certain marks of his own, namely, the signs of asterisks and obeli,2991 which
<note type="footnote">2990 The asterisks denoted that the words to which they were attached were added, and the obeli (†) that
something had been subtracted. See Jerome’s Preface to the Books of Kings in this Series.</note>
<note type="footnote">2991 Stars and spits.</note>

<pb n="1231"/>
words had been, so to speak, killed by other translators, and those which had been superfluously
introduced. But he put in no single word of his own, nor did he make it appear that
the certainty of our copies was in any point shaken; but those things which, as the actual
words run, seemed wanting in plainness and clearness, he showed to be full of the mysteries
of a spiritual meaning. What comfort then can the conduct of Origen give you in this matter,
when your work is shown to be quite unlike his, and when all your labour is spent upon
making one letter kill the next, whereas his endeavour, on the contrary, is to vindicate the
Spirit which giveth life?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">

<p>37. This action is yours, my brother, yours alone. It is clear that no one in the church
has been your companion or confederate in it, but only that Barabbas whom you mention
so frequently. What other spirit than that of the Jews would dare to tamper with the records
of the church which have been handed down from the Apostles? It is they, my brother, you
who were most dear to me before you were taken captive by the Jews, it is they who are
hurrying you into this abyss of evil. It is their doing that those books of yours are put forth
in which you brand your Christian brethren, not sparing even the martyrs, and heap up
accusations speakable and unspeakable against Christians of every degree, and mar our
peace, and cause a scandal to the church. It is they who cause you to pass sentence upon
yourself and your own writings as upon words which you once spoke as a Christian. We all
of us have become worthless in your eyes, while they and their evil acts are all your delight.
If you had but listened to Paul where he says in his Epistle:2992 “If any brother be overtaken
in a fault ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness,” you would never
have let your passions swell up so as altogether to break through the order of our spiritual
discipline. Suppose that I had written something which was injurious to you; suppose that
I had done some injustice to you a man of the highest eloquence, who were my brother and
my brother presbyter, whom also I had pronounced worthy of imitation in your method of
translation: even so, this was the first complaint which you had received of any injury on
my part since friendship had been restored between us, and that with difficulty and much
trouble. But suppose that you had reason to be offended at the fact that, in my translation
of Origen, I passed over some things which appeared to me unedifying in point of doctrine—
though in this I only did what you had done. Possibly I was deserving of blame and
correction for this. You say that some of the brethren sent letters to you demanding that
the faults of the translator should be pointed out. What then did you do, you who are a man
of spiritual attainments? What a model, what an example of conduct in such matters is this
which you have given! You not only blazen forth the shame of your brother’s nakedness to
those who are without, but you yourself tear away the covering of his nakedness. Suppose
even that what I did was not done as you had done it, suppose that, through some access of
drunkenness creeping unawares upon me, I had laid bare my own shame as the Patriarch
did; would it have been a curse which you would have incurred if you had walked backward
and made your reply like a soft cloak to cover my reproach, if the letter of the brother who
was wide-awake had veiled the brother who lay exposed through his own drowsiness in
writing?</p>

<p>38. But you will say, It was impossible for me to reply otherwise than I did. The letter
which I received was such that, if I had not replied and retranslated literally the books which
you had translated paraphrastically, I should myself have been thought to be a follower of
Origen. I will not at present say anything as to the character of that letter, except that it bears
the name of a man of high rank, Pammachius: but I ask, would there have been anything
uncourteous in such a reply as this: “My brothers we ought not readily to judge of other
men’s works. You remember what you did when I had sent my books against Jovinian to
Rome,2993 and when some persons understood them in a different sense from that in which,
if my memory serves me, I had composed them. They were read by a great many people,
and almost every one was offended by them, you yourself, as was believed, amongst them.
Did you not on that occasion withdraw from circulation the copies which had been exposed
to sale publicly in the forum, and send them, not to some one else, but to me, at the same
time pointing out the grounds on which you thought so many had been offended? And I,
as you remember, wrote an Apology in new terms, so as to give a sounder meaning, as far
as I could, to expressions to which a different sense had been attributed. Well, it is but fair
that as we would that men should do to us so we should do to them: and therefore, as you
sent me back my books for correction, so do now with these books: send them back to their
author, and hint to him what you think blameable in them, so that, if in anything he has
gone wrong, he may correct it. Besides, though I have exercised my talents on many subjects,
and laboured out many works, this is almost the first work which he has attempted, and
possibly even this he has done under compulsion, so that it is not strange if he has not gone
quite straight at first. We should not seize upon opportunities for disparaging men who are
Christians, but seek their advantage by correcting what they have done wrong.”</p>

<p>39. If your reply to him had been couched in terms like these, would you not have
ministered grace and edification both to him, since he has been initiated into the fear of
God, and to all your other readers, whereas these invectives of yours are the cause of sadness
and confusion to all who fear God, since they see you a prey to this hideous lust of detraction,
and me driven to the wretched necessity of recrimination. But, as I have said, this evidence
was unnecessary. You yourself in the books you published against Jovinian, at one time assert,
as can be shewn, the same things which you blamed in him, while at another you fall into
the opposite extreme, and declare marriage to be so disgraceful a state that its stain cannot
even be washed away by the blood of martyrdom. But, if it appeared to you an easy thing
for your friend to procure what amounts to a correction of the dogma of the Manichæans
as it was originally expressed in these books, and that when they were already published
and placed in the hands of many persons to copy, what difficulty would there have been in
my correcting a work which was not my own but a translation of that of another man, if
any mistakes could be pointed out in it, I will not say by reason, but even by envy? especially
when it was still in rough sheets, which I had not read over again or corrected, and which
were not published when your friends took possession of them. Was it an impossibility to
get these writings corrected which were then in an uncorrected state? But the sting does not
proceed from that quarter; he would have found nothing to blame there. It proceeds wholly
from the fact that he was afraid that it might come to light what is the source of all that he
says, and whence he gains the reputation of a learned man and a great expounder of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>40. I explained the reasons which induced me to make the translation so that it should
be seen that I acted, not in the spirit of contention and rivalry, in which he so often acts, but
from the necessity which I have explained above; and I did it as an aid to a good and useful
undertaking.2994 I hoped that it might impart something both of lucidity and of brightness
to one who, though with little culture, was composing a serious work. Do we not know cases
in which old houses have been of use in the construction of new ones? Sometimes a stone
is taken from the parts of an old house which are remote and concealed, to decorate the
portal of the new house and adorn its entrance. And at times an edifice of modern architecture
is supported by the strength of a single ancient beam. Are we then to place ourselves
in opposition to those who rightly use what is old in building up what is new? Are we to
say, You are not allowed to transfer the materials of the old house to the new, unless you
join each beam to its beam, each stone to its stone, unless you make a portico of what was
a portico before, a chamber of what was a chamber; and this must further involve building
up the most secret recesses from what were such before, and the sewers from the former
sewers: for every large house must have such places. This is the process of translating word
for word, which in former days you esteemed inadmissible, but which you now approve.
But you claim that what is in itself unlawful is lawful for you, while for us even what is lawful
you impute as a crime. You think it right that you should be praised for changing the words
of the Sacred Books and Divine volumes; but if we, when we imitate you in translating a
human work, pass over anything which seems to us not to be edifying, we are to have no
pardon for this at your hands, though you yourself set us the example.</p>

<p>41. However, let him act in these matters as he himself thinks lawful or expedient. Let
me recapitulate in the end of this book what I have said in a scattered way in my own defence.
He had said of me that it seemed as if I could not be a heretic without him; I therefore set
forth my belief and, in respect of the resurrection of the dead I proved that he rather than
I was in error, since he spoke of the resurrection body as frail. I shewed also that he did away
with the distinction of sex in the other world, saying that bodies would become souls women
men. I next revealed the causes which had led to my translation—very proper causes in my
opinion; I shewed that it was not because I was stimulated by contentiousness, nor because
I was desirous of glory, but because I was incited by the fear of God, that I imported a store
of old Greek material to be used in the new Latin construction, that I furbished up the old
armour which had become enveloped in rust, not with a view to excite a civil war but to
repel a hostile attack. I then introduced the chief matter on which they have laid their forgers’
hands, the adulterous blasphemy against the Son of God and the Holy Spirit, a thing quite
alien from me, but brought in by these men in their wickedness as I shewed by quotations.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">     
<pb n="1237"/>
<p>42. I then took up one by one the points in which he had blamed Origen, with the intention
of striking at me and discrediting my work of translation. I shewed from those very
Commentaries of his from which he had said that we might expect to learn and test his belief,
that on three points, namely the previous state of the soul, the restitution of all things, and
his views concerning the devil and apostate angels, he has himself written the same things
which he blames in Origen. I convicted him of having said that the souls of men were held
bound in this body as in a prison; and I proved that he had asserted in these very Commentaries
that the whole rational creation of angels and of human souls formed but a single body.
I next shewed that, as to an association for perjury, there was no one who had so much to
do with it in its deepest mysteries as himself; and in accordance with this I proved that the
doctrine that truth and the higher teaching ought not to be disclosed to all men was taught
by him in these same Commentaries. I next took up the question of secular literature, as to
which he had made this declaration to Christ as he sat on the judgment seat and ordered
him to be beaten: “If ever I read or possess the books of the heathen, I have denied Thee;”
and I shewed clearly that he not only reads and possesses these books now, but that he
supports all the bragging of which his teaching is full on his knowledge of them; so much
so that he boasts of having been introduced to the knowledge of logic through the Introduction
of Porphyry the prince of unbelievers. And, while he says that it is a doctrine of the
heathen, to speak in this or that manner both about the soul and about other creatures, I
shewed that he had spoken of God in a more degrading manner than any of the heathen
when he said that God had a mother-in-law. But further, whereas he had declared that he
had only mentioned Origen in two short Prefaces, and then not as a man of apostolic rank
but merely as a man of talent, I, though for brevity’s sake only bringing forward ten of his
Prefaces, established the fact that in each of them he had spoken of him not only as an
apostolic man but as a teacher of the churches next after the apostles, and as one whose
teaching was followed by himself and all wise men.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="47">     
<pb n="1238"/>
<p>43. Moreover, I pointed out clearly that it is habitual to him to disparage all good men,
and that, if he can find something to blame in one man after another of those who are highly
esteemed and have gained a name in literature, he thinks that he has added to his own
reputation. I shewed also how shamefully some of Christ’s2995 priests have been assailed by
him; and how he has spared neither the monks nor the virgins, nor those who live in continency,
whom he had praised before; how he has defamed in his lampoons every order and
degree of Christians; how shamefully and foully he assailed even Ambrose, that saintly man,
the memory of whose illustrious life still lives in the hearts of all men: how even Didymus,
whom he had formerly ranked among the seer-prophets and Apostles, now he places among
those whose teaching diverges from that of the churches; how he brands with the marks of
ignorance or of folly every single writer of ancient and of modern days; and finally does not
spare even the martyrs. All these things I have brought to the proof of his own works and
his own testimony, not to that of external witnesses. I have gone through each particular,
and have brought out the evidence from those very books of his which he most commends,
books which alone he excepted as containing nothing of which he needed to repent, while
he says that he repents of all his other sayings and writings; not that his repentance is sincere,
but that he is driven into such straits that he must choose either to feign penitence or to
forfeit the vantage ground which enables him to bite and wound any one whom he pleases.
I therefore preferred not to touch his other writings, so that his conviction might come out
of those alone out of which he had himself closed the door of repentance. Last of all I have
shown that he has altered the sacred books which the Apostles had committed to the churches
as the trustworthy deposit of the Holy Spirit, and that he who calls out about the audacity
shewn in translating mere human works himself commits the greater crime of subverting
the divine oracles.</p>

<p>44. It remains that every reader of this book should give his suffrage for one or the
other of us, judging as he desires that he may himself be judged by God; and that he should
not injure his own soul by favoring either party unjustly. Also, my beloved son Apronianus,
go to Pammachius, that saintly man whose letter is put forward by our friend in this Invective
or Bill of Indictment of his, and adjure him in Christ’s name to incline in his judgment to
the cause of innocence not that of party-spirit: it is the cause of truth that is at stake, and
religion not party should be our guide. It is a precept of our Lord2996 to “judge not according
to the appearance, but judge a righteous judgment,” and, just as in each one of the least of
his brethren it is Christ who is thirsty and hungry, who is clothed and fed; so in these who
are unjustly judged it is He who is judged unrighteously. When some are hated without a
cause, he will speak on their behalf and say:2997 “You have hated me without a cause.” What
judgment does he think will be formed of this cause and of his action in it before the tribunal
of Christ? He remembers well no doubt how, when the men we are speaking of had written
and published his books against Jovinian, and men were already reading them and finding
fault with them, he withdrew them from the hands of the readers, and stopped their remarks,
and blamed them for their blame of his friend; and how, further, he sent the books back to
the author, with the suggestion that he should either correct those passages which had been
found fault with, or in any way that he would set matters right. But when what I had written
fell into his hands,—it was not then a book but merely a number of imperfect, uncorrected
papers, which had been subtracted by fraud and theft by some scoundrel; he did not bring
it to me and complain of it, though I was close at hand; he did not deign even to rebuke me
or to convict me of wrong through some friend, as it might have been, or even some enemy;
but sent my papers to the East, and set to work the tongue of that man who never yet knew
how to control it. Would it have been against the precepts of our religion if he had met me
face to face? Did he think me so utterly unworthy of holding converse with him, that it was
not worth while even to argue with me? Yet for us too Christ died, for our salvation also He
shed his blood. We are sinners, I grant, but we belong to his flock and are numbered among
his sheep. Pammachius, however, must be held in honour for his excellent deeds wrought
through faith in Christ, which should be an example to all others; for he has counted his
rank as nothing worth, and has made himself equal to the humble; consequently, I was unwilling
to see him carried away by human partisanship and contention, lest his faith should
suffer damage in any way. At all events we shall see how far he preserves a right judgment
when he sees that that great master Jerome2998 taught, in the commentaries which he selected
as satisfactory even after his repentance, the very things which he condemns in others as
<note type="footnote">2996 John vii. 24</note>
<note type="footnote">2997 John xv. 25</note>
<note type="footnote">2998 The older editions do not contain the name.</note>

<pb n="1240"/>
being alien to his own teaching. We shall think that his former action was a mistake due to
ignorance if he recognizes it and sets it right. As for myself, though2999 under the compulsion
of necessity, I have endeavoured to make answer to him who had attacked me with such
great bitterness, yet for this also I ask for forgiveness if I have handled the matter too sharply;
for God is my witness how truly I can say that I have kept silence on many more points than
I have brought forward. I could not wholly keep silence in the presence of accusations which
I know to be undeserved, when I heard from many that my silence would bring their own
faith into peril.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="49">

<p>45. After this Apology had been written, one of the brethren who came to us from you
at Rome and helped me in revising it, observed that one point in my defence had been passed
over which he had heard adversely dwelt upon by my detractors there. The point turns upon
a statement in my Preface, where I said of him who is now my persecutor and accuser that
in the works of Origen which he translated there are found certain grounds of offence in
the Greek, but that he has in his translation so cleared them away that the Latin reader will
find nothing in them which is dissonant from our faith. On this sentence they remark: “You
see how he has praised his method of translation and has borne his testimony that in the
books he has translated no grounds of offence are to be found, and promised that he would
himself follow the same method. Why then is not his own translation free from grounds of
offence, as he bears witness is the case with the writings of the other?”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="50">     
<pb n="1242"/>
<p>46. I suppose it is not to be wondered at that I am always blamed for the points in which
I have praised him. It is quite right, no doubt. But to come to the matter itself. I said that
when grounds of offence appeared in the Greek he had cleared them away in his Latin
translation; and not wrongly; but he had done this just in the same sense as I have done it.
For instance, in the Homilies on Isaiah, he explains the two Seraphim as meaning the Son
and the Holy Ghost, and he adds this of his own: “Let no one think that there is a difference
of nature in the Trinity when the offices of the Persons are distinguished”; and by this he
thinks that he has been able to remedy the grounds of offence. I in a similar way occasionally
removed, altered or added a few words, in the attempt to draw the meaning of the writer
into better accordance with the straight path of the faith. What did I do in this which was
different or contrary to our friend’s system? what which was not identical with it? But the
difference lies in this, that I was judging of his writings without ill-will or detraction, and
therefore saw in them not what might lend itself to depreciation, but what the translator
aimed at; whereas he is seeking for occasions for calumniating others, and therefore finds
fault with those things in my writings which he himself has formerly written. And indeed
he is right in blaming me, since I have pronounced what he has said to be right, whereas in
his judgment it is reprehensible. This holds in reference to the doctrine he has expressed
about the Trinity; namely, that the two Seraphim are the Son and the Holy Ghost, from
which especially the charge of blasphemy is drawn, that is, if he is to be judged according
to the system which he has adopted in dealing with me. But according to the system which
I have adopted in judging of his writings, apart from the matter of calumny, he is not to be
held guilty because of what he has added on his own account to explain the author’s meaning.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">     
<pb n="1243"/>
<p>47. As regards the resurrection of the flesh, I think that my translation contains the
same doctrines which are preached in the churches. As to the other points which relate to
the various orders of created beings, I have already said that they have nothing to do with
our faith in the Deity. But if he appeals to these for the sake of calumniating others, though
they have hitherto presented no ground of offence, I do not deny his right to do so, if he
thinks well to revoke my judgment by which he might have been absolved, and to enforce
his own, by which he ought to be condemned. It is not my judgment on him which is
blameable, but his own, which takes others to task for doing what he approves in himself.
But this is a new method of judgment according to which I am defending my own accuser,
and he considers that he has at last gained the victory over me when he has brought himself
in guilty. But suppose that a Synod of Bishops should accept the sentences you have pronounced,
and should demand that all the books which contain the impugned doctrines,
together with their authors, should be condemned; then these books must be condemned
first as they stand in the Greek; and then what is condemned in Greek must undoubtedly
be condemned in the Latin. Then will come the turn of your own books; they will be found
to contain the same things, even according to your own judgment. And as it has been of no
advantage to Origen that you have praised him, so it will be of no profit to you that I have
pleaded in your behalf. I shall then be bound to follow the judgment of the Catholic Church
whether it is given against the books of Origen or against yours.</p>

<head>Jerome’s Apology for Himself Against the Books of
Rufinus.</head>
<head>Addressed to Pammachius and Marcella from Bethlehem, a.d. 402.</head>

<head>Book I.</head>
<p>The documents which Jerome had before him when he wrote his Apology were (1)
Rufinus’ Translation of Pamphilus’ Apology with the Preface prefixed to it and the book on
the Falsification of the Books of Origen, (2) the Translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν and Rufinus’
Preface, (3) The Apology of Rufinus addressed to Anastasius (see p. 430), and (4) Anastasius’
letter to John of Jerusalem (p. 432 Apol. ii, 14, iii, 20). He had also other letters of Anastasius
like that addressed to the Bishop of Milan (Jerome Letter 95. See also Apol. iii, 21). But he
had not the full text of Rufinus’ Apology (c. 4, 15). He received letters from Pammachius
and Marcella, at the beginning of the Spring of 402, when the Apology written at Aquileia
at the end of 400 had become known to Rufinus’ friends for some time. They had been unable
to obtain a full copy, but had sent the chief heads of it, and had strongly urged Jerome to
reply. At the same time his brother Paulinianus who had been some three years in the West,
returned to Palestine by way of Rome, and there heard and saw portions of Rufinus’ Apology,
which he committed to memory (Apol. i, 21, 28) and repeated at Bethlehem. To these documents
Jerome replies.</p>
<p>The heads of the First Book are as follows.</p>
<p>1. It is hard that an old friend with whom I had been reconciled should attack me in a
book secretly circulated among his disciples.</p>
<p>2. Others have translated Origen. Why does he single me out?</p>
<p>3. He gave me fictitious praise in his Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. Now, since I defend
myself, he writes 3 books against me as an enemy.</p>
<p>4, 5. He spoke of me as united in faith with him; but what is his faith? Why are his books
kept secret? I can meet any attack.</p>
<p>6. I translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν because you demanded it, and because his translation
slurred over Origen’s heresies.</p>
<p>7. My translation put away ambiguities, and showed the real character of the book, and
of the previous translation.</p>
<p>8. My translation of Origen’s Commentaries created no excitement; his first translation,
of Pamphilus’ Apology, roused all Rome to indignation.</p>
<p>9. But the work was really Eusebius’s, who tells us that Pamphilus wrote nothing.</p>

<pb n="1245"/>
<p>10. After the condemnation of Origen by Theophilus and Anastasius, it would be wise
in Rufinus to give up this pretended defence.</p>
<p>11. I had praised Eusebius as well as Origen only as writers; and was forced to condemn
them as heretics. Why should this be taken amiss?</p>
<p>12. I wrote a friendly letter to Rufinus, which my friends kept back.</p>
<p>13. There is nothing to blame in my getting the help of a Jew in translating from the
Hebrew.</p>
<p>14. There is nothing strange in my praising Origen before I knew the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</p>
<p>15. The accusations seem inconsistent, but I knew them only by report.</p>
<p>16. The office of a commentator.</p>
<p>17. We must distinguish methods of writing, and not expect a vulgar simplicity in the
various compositions of cultured men.</p>
<p>18. My assertion was true, that Origen permitted the use of falsehood.</p>
<p>19. The accusation about a mistranslation of Ps. ii is easily explained.</p>
<p>20. In the difficulties of the translator and the commentator we must get help where we
can.</p>
<p>21. In the Commentary on Ephesians I acted straightforwardly in giving the views of
Origen and others.</p>
<p>22. As to the passage “He hath chosen us before the foundation of the world.”</p>
<p>23. As to the passage “Far above all rule and authority U+0026c.”</p>
<p>24. As to the passage “That in the ages to come U+0026c.”</p>
<p>25. As to “Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>26. As to “The body fitly framed U+0026c.”</p>
<p>27. I quoted Origen’s views as, “According to another heresy.”</p>
<p>28, 29. As to “Men loving their wives as their own bodies.”</p>
<p>30. To the charge of reading secular books I reply that I remember what I learned in
youth.</p>
<p>31. Also, a promise given in a dream must not be pressed. Why should such things be
raked up by old friends against one another?</p>
<p>32. I am right in my contention that all sins are remitted in baptism.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">

<p>I have learned not only from your letter but from those of many others that cavils are
raised against me in the school of Tyrannus,3000 “by the tongue of my dogs from the enemies
by himself”3001 because I have translated the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν into Latin. What unprecedented
shamelessness is this! They accuse the physician for detecting the poison: and this in
order to protect their vendor of drugs, not in obtaining the reward of innocence but in his
partnership with the criminal; as if the number of the offenders diminished the crime, or
as if the accusation depended on our personal feelings not on the facts. Pamphlets are
written against me; they are forced on every one’s attention; and yet they are not openly
published, so that the hearts of the simple are disturbed, and no opportunity is given me of
answering. This is a new way of injuring a man, to make accusations which you are afraid
of sending abroad, to write what you are obliged to hide. If what he writes is true, why is he
afraid of the public? if it is false, why has he written it? We read when we were boys the
words of Cicero: “I consider it a lack of self-control to write anything which you intend to
keep hidden.”3002 I ask, What is it of which they complain? Whence comes this heat, this
madness of theirs? Is it because I have rejected a feigned laudation?3003 Because I refused
the praise offered in insincere words? Because under the name of a friend I detected the
snares of an enemy? I am called in this Preface brother and colleague, yet my supposed
crimes are set forth openly, and it is proclaimed that I have written in favour of Origen, and
have by my praises exalted him to the skies. The writer says that he has done this with a
good intention. How then does it come to pass that he now casts in my teeth, as an open
enemy, what he then praised as a friend? He declared that he had meant to follow me as his
predecessor in his translation, and to borrow an authority for his work from some poor
works of mine. If that was so, it would have been sufficient for him to have stated once for
all that I had written. Where was the necessity for him to repeat the same things, and to
force them on men’s notice by iteration, and to turn over the same words again and again,
as if no one would believe in his praises? A praise which is simple and genuine does not
show all this anxiety about its credit with the reader. How is it that he is afraid that, unless
he produces my own words as witnesses, no one will believe him when he praises me? You
see that we perfectly understand his arts; he has evidently been to the theatrical school, and
has learned up by constant practice the part of the mocking encomiast. It is of no use to put
on a veil of simplicity, when the schemer is detected in his malicious purpose. To have made

a mistake once, or, to stretch the point, even twice, may be an unlucky chance; but how is
it that he makes the supposed mistake with his eyes open, and repeats it, and weaves this
mistake into the whole tissue of his writings so as to make it impossible for me to deny the
things for which he praises me? A true friend who knew what he was about would, after our
previous misunderstanding and our reconciliation, have avoided all appearance of suspicious
conduct, and would have taken care not to do through inadvertence what might seem to be
done advisedly. Tully says in his book of pleadings for Galinius: “I have always felt that it
was a religious duty of the highest kind to preserve every friendship that I have formed; but
most of all those in which kindness has been restored after some disagreement. In the case
of friendships which have never been shaken, if some attention has not been paid, the excuse
of forgetfulness, or at the worst of neglect is readily accepted; but after a return to friendship,
if anything is done to cause offence, it is imputed not to neglect but to an unfriendly intention,
it is no longer a question of thoughtlessness but of breach of faith.” So Horace writes in his
Epistle to Florus</p>

<p>2. What good does it do me that he declares on his oath that it was through simplicity
that he went wrong? His praises are, as you know, cast in my teeth, and the laudation of this
most simple friend (which however has not much either of simplicity or of sincerity in it)
is imputed to me as a crime. If he was seeking a foundation of authority for what he was
doing, and wishing to shew who had gone before him in this path he had at hand the Confessor
Hilary, who translated the books of Origen upon Job and the Psalms consisting of
forty thousand lines. He had Ambrose whose works are, almost all of them, full of what
Origen has written; and the martyr Victorinus, who acts really with ‘simplicity,’ and without
setting snares for others. As to all these he keeps silence; he does not notice those who are
like pillars of the church; but me, who am but like a flea and a man of no account, he hunts
out from corner to corner. Perhaps the same simplicity which made him unconscious that
he was attacking his friend will make him swear that he knew nothing of these writers. But
who will believe that he does not know these men whose memory is quite recent, even
though they were Latins, being as he is such a very learned man, and one who has so great
a knowledge of the old writers, especially the Greeks, that, in his zeal for foreign knowledge
he has almost lost his own language?3005 The truth is it is not so much that I have been
praised by him as that those writers have not been attacked. But whether what he has written
is praise (as he tries to make simpletons believe) or an attack, (as I feel it to be from the pain
which his wounds give me), he has taken care that I should have none of my contemporaries
to bring me honor by a partnership in praise, nor consolation by a partnership in vituperation.</p>

<p>3. I have in my hands your letter,3006 in which you tell me that I have been accused, and
expect me to reply to my accuser lest silence should be taken as an acknowledgment of his
charges. I confess that I sent the reply; but, though I felt hurt, I observed the laws of friendship,
and defended myself without accusing my accuser. I put it as if the objections which
one friend had raised at Rome were being bruited about by many enemies in all parts of the
world, so that every one should think that I was replying to the charges, not to the man.
Will you tell me that another course was open to me, that I was bound by the law of
friendship to keep silence under accusation, and, though I felt my face, so to say, covered
with dirt and bespattered with the filth of heresy, not even to wash it with simple water, for
fear that an act of injustice might be imputed to him. This demand is not such as any man
ought to make or such as any man ought to accept. You openly assail your friend, and set
out charges against him under the mask of an admirer; and he is not even to be allowed to
prove himself a catholic, or to reply that the supposed heresy on which this laudation is
grounded arises not from any agreement with a heresy, but from admiration of a great
genius. He thought it desirable to translate this book into Latin; or, as he prefers to have it
thought he was compelled, though unwilling, to do it. But what need was there for him to
bring me into the question, when I was in retirement, and separated from him by vast intervals
of land and sea? Why need he expose me to the ill-will of the multitude, and do more
harm to me by his praise than good to himself by putting me forward as his example? Now
also, since I have repudiated his praise, and, by erasing what he had written, have shewn
that I am not what my friend declared, I am told that he is in a fury, and has composed three
books against me full of graceful Attic raillery, making those very things the object of attack
which he had praised before, and turning into a ground of accusation against me the impious
doctrines of Origen; although in that Preface in which he so lauded me, he says of me: “I
shall follow the rules of translation laid down by my predecessors, and particularly those
acted on by the writer whom I have just mentioned. He has rendered into Latin more than
seventy of Origen’s homiletical treatises, and a few also of his commentaries on the Apostle;
and in these, wherever the Greek text presents a stumbling block, he has smoothed it down
in his version and has so emended the language used that a Latin writer can find no word
that is at variance with our faith. In his steps, therefore, I propose to walk, if not displaying
the same vigorous eloquence, at least observing the same rules.”</p>

<p>4. These words are his own, he cannot deny them. The very elegance of the style and
the laboured mode of speech, and, surpassing all these, the Christian ‘simplicity’ which here
appears, reveal the character of their author. But there is a different phase of the matter:
Eusebius, it seems, has depraved these books; and now my friend who accuses Origen, and
who is so careful of my reputation, declares that both Eusebius and I have gone wrong together,
and then that we have held correct opinions together, and that in one and the same
work. But he cannot now be my enemy and call me a heretic, when a moment before he has
said that his belief was not dissonant from mine. Then, I must ask him what is the meaning
of his balanced and doubtful way of speaking: “The Latin reader,” he says, “will find nothing
here discordant from our faith.” What faith is this which he calls his? Is it the faith by which
the Roman Church is distinguished? or is it the faith which is contained in the works of
Origen? If he answers “the Roman,” then we are the Catholics, since we have adopted none
of Origen’s errors in our translations. But if Origen’s blasphemy is his faith, then, though
he tries to fix on me the charge of inconsistency, he proves himself to be a heretic. If the
man who praises me is orthodox, he takes me, by his own confession as a sharer in his orthodoxy.
If he is heterodox, he shews that he had praised me before my explanation because
he thought me a sharer in his error. However, it will be time enough to reply to these books
of his which whisper in corners and made their venomous attacks in secret, when they are
published and come out from their dark places into the light, and when they have been able
to reach me either through the zeal of my friends or the imprudence of my adversaries. We
need not be much afraid of attacks which their author fears to publish and allows only his
confederates to read. Then and not till then will I either acknowledge the justice of his
charges, or refute them, or retort upon the accuser the accusations he has made: and will
shew that my silence has been the result not of a bad conscience but of forbearance.</p>

<p>5. In the meantime, I desired to free myself from suspicion in the implicit judgment of
the reader, and to refute the gravest of the charges in the eyes of my friends. I did not wish
it to appear that I had been the first to strike, seeing that I have not, even when wounded,
aimed a blow against my assailant, but have only sought to heal my own wound. I beg the
reader to let the blame rest on him who struck the first blow, without respect of persons.
He is not content with striking; but, as if he were dealing with a man whom he had reduced
to silence and who would never speak again, he has written three elaborate books and has
made out from my works a list of “Contradictions” worthy of Marcion.3007 Our minds are
all on fire to know at once what his doctrine is and what is this madness of mine which we
had not expected. Perhaps he has learnt (though the time for it has been short) all that is
necessary to make him my teacher, and a sudden flow of eloquence will reveal what no one
imagined that he knew.</p>
<p>3008 “Grant it, O Father; mighty Jesus, grant.</p>

<p>Though he may brandish the spear of his accusations and hurl them against us with all
his might, we trust in the Lord our Saviour that his truth will encompass us as with a shield,
and we shall be able to sing with the Psalmist:3009 “Their blows have become as the arrows
of the little ones,” and3010 “Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
fear; though war should rise against me, even then will I be confident.” But of this at another

<p>6. His followers object to me, (and
3011 “Weary of work
They ply the arms of Ceres,”)
that I have translated into the Latin tongue the books of Origen Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, which are
pernicious and repugnant to the faith of the Church. My answer to them is brief and succinct:
“Your letters, my brother Pammachius, and those of your friends, have compelled me. You
declared that these books had been falsely translated by another, and that not a few things
had been interpolated or added or altered. And, lest your letters should fail to carry conviction,
you sent a copy of this translation, together with the Preface in which I was praised.
As soon as I had run my eye over these documents, I at once noticed that the impious doctrine
enunciated by Origen about the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, to which the ears of
Romans could not bear to listen, had been changed by the translator so as to give a more
orthodox meaning. His other doctrines, on the fall of the angels, the lapse of human souls,
his prevarications about the resurrection, his ideas about the world, or rather Epicurus’s
middle-spaces,3012 on the restitution of all to a state of equality, and others much worse
than these, which it would take too long to recount, I found that he had either translated as
they stood in the Greek, or had stated them in a stronger and exaggerated manner in words
taken from the books of Didymus, who is the most open champion of Origen. The effect of
all this is that the reader, finding that the book expressed the catholic doctrine on the Trinity,
would take in these heretical views without warning.</p>

<p>7. One who was not his friend would probably say to him: Either change everything
which is bad, or else make known everything which you think thoroughly good. If for the
sake of simple Christians you cut out everything which is pernicious, and do not choose to
put into a foreign language the things that you say have been added by heretics; tell us
everything which is pernicious. But, if you mean to make a veracious and faithful translation,
why do you change some things and leave others untouched? You make an open profession
in the prologue that you have amended what is bad and have left all that is best: and therefore,
if anything in the work is proved to be heretical, you cannot enjoy the license given to a
translator but must accept the authority of a writer: and you will be openly convicted of the
criminal intent of besmearing with honey the poisoned cup so that the sweetness which
meets the sense may hide the deadly venom. These things, and things much harder than
these, an enemy would say; and he would draw you before the tribunal of the church, not
as the translator of a bad work but as one who assents to its doctrines. But I am satisfied
with having simply defended myself. I expressed in Latin just what I found in the Greek text
of the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, not wishing the reader to believe what was in my translation, but
wishing him not to believe what was in yours. I looked for a double advantage as the result
of my work, first to unveil the heresy of the author and secondly to convict the untrustworthiness
of the translator. And, that no one might think that I assented to the doctrine which
I had translated, I asserted in the Preface how I had been compelled to make this version
and pointed out what the reader ought not to believe. The first translation makes for the
glory of the author, the second for his shame. The one summons the reader to believe its
doctrines, the other moves him to disbelieve them. In that I am claimed against my will as
praising the author; in this I not only do not praise him, but am compelled to accuse the
man who does praise him. The same task has been accomplished by each, but with a different
intention: the same journey has had two different issues. Our friend has taken away words
which existed, alleging that the books had been depraved by heretics: and he has put in those
which did not exist, alleging that the assertions had been made by the author in other places;
but of this he will never convince us unless he can point out the actual places whence he
says that he has taken them. My endeavour was to change nothing from what was actually
there; for my object in translating the work was to expose the false doctrines which I translated.
Do you look upon me as merely a translator? I was more. I turned informer. I informed
against a heretic, to clear the church of heresy. The reasons which led me formerly to praise
Origen in certain particulars are set forth in the treatise prefixed to this work. The sole cause
which led to my translation is now before the reader. No one has a right to charge me with
the author’s impiety, for I did it with a pious intention, that of betraying the impiety which
had been commended as piety to the churches.</p>

<p>8. I had given Latin versions, as my friend tauntingly says, of seventy books of Origen,
and of some parts of his Tomes, but no question was ever raised about my work; no commotion
was felt on the subject in Rome. What need was there to commit to the ears of the
Latins what Greece denounces and the whole world blames? I, though translating many of
Origen’s work in the course of many years, never created a scandal: but you, though unknown
before, have by your first and only work become notorious for your rash proceeding. Your
Preface tells us that you have also translated the work of Pamphilus the martyr in defence
of Origen; and you strive with all your might to prevent the church from condemning a
man whose faith the martyr attests. The real fact is3013 that Eusebius Bishop of Cæsarea, as
I have already said before, who was in his day the standard bearer of the Arian faction, wrote
a large and elaborate work in six books in defence of Origen, showing by many testimonies
that Origen was in his sense a catholic, that is, in our sense, an Arian. The first of these six
books you have translated and assigned it to the martyr. I must not wonder, therefore, that
you wish to make me, a small man and of no account, appear as an admirer of Origen, when
you bring the same calumny against the martyr. You change a few statements about the Son
of God and the holy Spirit, which you knew would offend the Romans, and let the rest go
unchanged from beginning to end; you did, in fact, in the case of this Apology of Pamphilus
as you call it, just what you did in the translation of Origen’s Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. If that book is
Pamphilus’s, which of the six books is Eusebius’s first? In the very volume which you pretend
to be Pamphilus’s, mention is made of the later books. Also, in the second and following
books, Eusebius says that he had said such and such things in the first book and excuses
himself for repeating them. If the whole work is Pamphilus’s, why do you not translate the
remaining books? If it is the work of the other, why do you change the name? You cannot
answer; but the facts make answer of themselves: You thought that men would believe the
martyr, though they would have turned in abhorrence from the chief of the Arians.</p>
<note type="footnote">3013 See this question fully argued out by Lightfoot in the Dict. of Christian Biography, Art. Eusebius of
Cæsaria. He says: “The Defence of Origen was the joint work of Pamphilus and Eusebius:” and “Jerome’s treatment
of this matter is a painful exhibition of disingenuousness, U+0026c.” See De V. Ill. lxxv.</note>

<p>9. Am I to say plainly what your intention was, my most simple-minded friend? Do you
think that we can believe that you unwittingly gave the name of the martyr to the book of
a man who was a heretic, and thus made the ignorant, through their trust in Christ’s witness,
become the defenders of Origen? Considering the erudition for which you are renowned,
for which you are praised throughout the West as an illustrious litterateur,3014 so that the
men of your party all speak of you as their Coryphæus, I will not suppose that you are ignorant
of Eusebius’3015 Catalogue, which states the fact that the martyr Pamphilus never wrote
a single book.3016 Eusebius himself, the lover and companion of Pamphilus, and the herald
of his praises, wrote three books in elegant language containing the life of Pamphilus. In
these he extols other traits of his character with extraordinary encomiums, and praises to
the sky his humility; but on his literary interests he writes as follows in the third book: “What
lover of books was there who did not find a friend in Pamphilus? If he knew of any of them
being in want of the necessaries of life, he helped them to the full extent of his power. He
would not only lend them copies of the Holy Scriptures to read, but would give them most
readily, and that not only to men, but to women also if he saw that they were given to
reading. He therefore kept a store of manuscripts, so that he might be able to give them to
those who wished for them whenever occasion demanded. He himself however, wrote
nothing whatever of his own, except private letters which he sent to his friends, so humble
was his estimate of himself. But the treatises of the old writers he studied with the greatest
diligence, and was constantly occupied in meditation upon them.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3014 Συγγραφεύς</note>
<note type="footnote">3015 Συντάγμα. No work of Eusebius appears to have borne this title. The work alluded to is either the Life
of Pamphilus or the Book On the Martyrs of Palestine.</note>
<note type="footnote">3016 “The existence of a work which consisted mainly of extracts from Origen with Comments, and of which
he was only the joint author, is quite reconcilable with this statement. Indeed, the very form of the expression
in the original, corresponding to ‘ipse quidem’ ‘proprii’ was probably chosen so as to exclude this work of compilation
and partnership.” Lightfoot, Art. Eusebius of Cæsarea, in Dict. of Christian Biography.</note>

<p>10. The champion of Origen, you see, the encomiast of Pamphilus, declares that
Pamphilus wrote nothing whatever, that he composed no single treatise of his own. And
you cannot take refuge in the hypothesis that Pamphilus wrote this book after Eusebius’s
publication, since Eusebius wrote after Pamphilus had attained the crown of martyrdom.
What then can you now do? The consciences of a great many persons have been wounded
by the book which you have published under the name of the martyr; they give no heed to
the authority of the bishops who condemn Origen, since they think that a martyr has praised
him. Of what use are the letters of the bishop Theophilus or of the pope Anastasius, who
follow out the heretic in every part of the world, when your book passing under the name
of Pamphilus is there to oppose their letters, and the testimony of the martyr can be set
against the authority of the Bishops? I think you had better do with this mistitled3017 volume
what you did with the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν. Take my advice as a friend, and do not be distrust-
ful of the power of your art; say either that you never wrote it, or else that it has been depraved
by the presbyter Eusebius.3018 It will be impossible to prove against you that the book was
translated by you. Your handwriting is not forthcoming to shew it; your eloquence is not
so great as that no one can imitate your style. Or, in the last resort, if the matter comes to
the proof, and your effrontery is overborne by the multitude of testimonies, sing a palinode
after the manner of Stesichnus. It is better that you should repent of what you have done
than that a martyr should remain under calumny, and those who have been deceived under
error. And you need not feel ashamed of changing your opinion; you are not of such fame
or authority as to feel disgraced by the confession of an error. Take me for your example,
whom you love so much, and without whom you can neither live nor die, and say what I
said when you had praised me and I defended myself.</p>

<p>11. Eusebius the Bishop of Cæsarea, of whom I have made mention above, in the sixth
book of his Apology for Origen makes the same complaint against Methodius the bishop
and martyr, which you make against me in your praises of me. He says: How could Methodius
dare to write now against Origen, after having said this thing and that of his doctrines?
This is not the place in which to speak of the martyr; one cannot discuss every thing in all
places alike. Let it suffice for the present to mention that one who was an Arian complains
of the same things in a most eminent and eloquent man, and a martyr, which you first make
a subject of praise as a friend and afterwards, when offended turn into an accusation. I have
given you an opportunity of constructing a calumny against me if you choose, in the present
passage. “How is it,” you may ask, “that I now depreciate Eusebius, after having in other
places praised him?” The name Eusebius indeed is different from Origen; but the ground
of complaint is in both cases identical. I praised Eusebius for his Ecclesiastical History, for
his Chronicle, for his description of the holy land; and these works3019 of his I gave to the
men of the same language as myself by translating them into Latin. Am I to be called an
Arian because Eusebius, the author of those books, is an Arian? If you should dare to call
me a heretic, call to mind your Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, in which you bear me witness
that I am of the same faith with yourself: and I at the same time entreat you to hear patiently
the expostulation of one who was formerly your friend. You enter into a warm dispute with
others, and bandy mutual reproaches with men of your own order; whether you are right
or wrong in this is for you to say. But as against a brother even a true accusation is repugnant
to me. I do not say this to blame others; I only say that I would not myself do it. We are
separated from one another by a vast interval of space. What sin had I committed against
you? What is my offence? Is it that I answered that I was not an Origenist? Are you to be
held to be accused because I defend myself? If you say you are not an Origenist and have
never been one, I believe your solemn affirmation of this: if you once were one, I accept
your repentance. Why do you complain if I am what you say that you are? Or is my offence
this that I dared to translate the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν after you had done it, and that my translation
is supposed to detract from your work? But what was I to do? Your laudation of me, or accusation
against me, was sent to me. Your ‘praise’ was so strong and so long that, if I had
acquiesced in it, every one would have thought me a heretic. Look at what is said in the end
of the letter which I received from Rome:3020 “Clear yourself from the suspicions which
men have imbibed against you, and convict your accuser of speaking falsely; for if you leave
him unnoticed, you will be held to assent to his charges.” When I was pressed by such conditions,
I determined to translate these books, and I ask your attention to the answer which
<note type="footnote">3019 Jerome translated the Chronicle and the Description of the Holy Land, but not this History. This was
done later by Rufinus.</note>
<note type="footnote">3020 Jerome Letter lxxxiii.</note>

<pb n="1258"/>
I made. It was this:3021 “This is the position which my friends have made for me, (observe
that I did not say ‘my friend,’ for fear of seeming to aim at you); if I keep silence I am to be
accounted guilty: if I answer, I am accounted an enemy. Both these conditions are hard; but
of the two I will choose the easier: for a quarrel can be healed, but blasphemy admits of no
forgiveness.” You observe that I felt this as a burden laid upon me; that I was unwilling and
recalcitrating; that I could only quiet my presentiment of the quarrel which would ensue
from this undertaking by the plea of necessity. If you had translated the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν
without alluding to me, you would have a right to complain that I had afterwards translated
them to your prejudice. But now you have no right to complain, since my work was only
an answer to the attack you had made on me under the guise of praise; for what you call
praise all understand as accusation. Let it be understood between us that you accused me,
and then you will not be indignant at my having replied. But now suppose that you wrote
with a good intention, that you were not merely innocent but a most faithful friend, out of
whose mouth no untruth ever proceeded, and that it was quite unconsciously that you
wounded me. What is that to me who felt the wound? Am I not to take remedies for my
wound because you inflicted it without evil intention? I am stricken down and stricken
through, with a wound in the breast which will not be appeased; my limbs which were white
before are stained with gore; and you say to me: “Pray leave your wound untouched, for
fear that I may be thought to have wounded you.” And yet the translation in question is a
reproof to Origen rather than to you. You altered for the better the passages which you
considered to have been put in by the heretics. I brought to light what the whole Greek
world with one voice attributes to him. Which of our two views is the truer it is not for me
nor for you to judge; let each of them be touched by the censor’s rod of the reader. The
whole of that letter in which I make answer for myself is directed against the heretics and
against my accusers. How does it touch you who profess to be both an orthodox person and
my admirer, if I am a little too sharp upon heretics, and expose their tricks before the public?
You should rejoice in my invectives: otherwise, if you are vexed at them, you may be thought
to be yourself a heretic. When anything is written against some particular vice, but without
the mention of any name, if a man grows angry he accuses himself. It would have been the
part of a wise man, even if he felt hurt, to dissemble his consciousness of wrong, and by the
serenity of his countenance to dissipate the cloud that lay upon his heart.</p>

<p>12. Otherwise, if everything which goes against Origen and his followers is supposed
to be said by me against you, we must suppose that the letters of the popes Theophilus and
Epiphanius and the rest of the bishops which at their desire I lately translated3022 are meant
to attack you and tear you to pieces; we must suppose too that the rescripts of the Emperors
which order that the Origenists should be banished from Alexandria and from Egypt have
been written at my dictation. The abhorrence shown by the Pontiff of the city of Rome
against these men was nothing but a scheme of mine. The outburst of hatred which immediately
after your translation blazed up through the whole world against Origen who before
had been read without prejudice was the work of my pen. If I have got all this power, I
wonder that you are not afraid of me. But I really acted with extreme moderation. In my
public letter3023 I took every precaution to prevent your supposing that anything in it was
directed against you; but I wrote at the same time a short letter3024 to you, expostulating
with you on the subject of your ‘praises.’ This letter my friends did not think it right to send
you, because you were not at Rome, and because, as they tell me, you and your companions
were scattering accusations of things unworthy of the Christian profession about my manner
of life. But I have subjoined a copy of it to this book, so that you may understand what pain
you gave me and with what brotherly self-restraint I bore it.</p>

<p>13. I am told, further, that you touch with some critical sharpness upon some points of
my letter, and, with the well-known wrinkles rising on your forehead and your eyebrows
knitted, make sport of me with a wit worthy of Plautus, for having said that I had a Jew
named Barabbas for my teacher. I do not wonder at your writing Barabbas for Baranina,
the letters of the names being somewhat similar, when you allow yourself such a license in
changing the names themselves, as to turn Eusebius into Pamphilus, and a heretic into a
martyr. One must be cautious of such a man as you, and give you a wide berth; otherwise I
may find my own name turned in a trice, and without my knowing it, from Jerome to
Sardanapalus. Listen, then, O pillar of wisdom, and type of Catonian severity. I never spoke
of him as my master; I merely wished to illustrate my method of studying the Holy Scriptures
by saying that I had read Origen just in the same way as I had taken lessons from this Jew.
Did I do you an injury because I attended the lectures of Apollinarius and Didymus rather
than yours? Was there anything to prevent my naming in my letter that most eloquent man
Gregory?3025 Which of all the Latins is his equal? I may well glory and exult in him. But I
only mentioned those who were subject to censure, so as to show that I only read Origen
as I had listened to them, that is, not on account of his soundness in the faith but on account
of the excellence of his learning. Origen himself, and Clement and Eusebius, and many
others, when they are discussing scriptural points, and wish to have Jewish authority for
what they say, write: “A Hebrew stated this to me,” or “I heard from a Hebrew,” or, “That
is the opinion of the Hebrews.” Origen certainly speaks of the Patriarch Huillus who was
his contemporary, and in the conclusion of his thirtieth Tome on Isaiah (that in the end of
which he explains the words3026 “Woe to Ariel which David took by storm”) uses his exposition

than that which he had previously held. He also takes as written by Moses not only the
eighty-ninth Psalm3027 which is entitled “A prayer of Moses the Man of God,” but also the
eleven following Psalms which have no title according to Huillus’s opinion; and he makes
no scruple of inserting in his commentaries on the Hebrew Scriptures the views of the
Hebrew teachers.</p>

<p>14. It is said that on a recent occasion where the letters of Theophilus exposing the errors
of Origen were read, our friend stopped his ears, and along with all present pronounced a
distinct condemnation upon the author of so much evil; and that he said that up to that
moment he had never known that Origen had written anything so wrong. I say nothing
against this: I do not make the observation which perhaps another might make, that it was
impossible for him to be ignorant of that which he had himself translated, and an apology
for which by a heretic he had published under the name of a martyr, whose defence also he
had undertaken in his own book; as to which I shall have some adverse remarks to make
later on if I have time to write them. I only make one observation which does not admit of
contradiction. If it is possible that he should have misunderstood what he translated, why
is it not possible that I should have been ignorant of the book Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν which I had not
before read, and that I should have only read those Homilies which I translated, and in
which he himself testifies that there is nothing wrong? But if, contrary to his expressed
opinion, he now finds fault with me for those things for which he before had given me praise,
he will be in a strait between two; either he praised me, believing me to be a heretic but
confessing that he shared my opinion; or else, if he praised me before as orthodox, his present
accusations come to nothing, and are due to sheer malice. But perhaps it was only as my
friend that he formerly was silent about my errors, and now that he is angry with me brings
to light what he had concealed.</p>

brings with it the suspicion of falsehood. Still I will be bold enough to go to meet him, and
to ask what heretical doctrine I have expressed, so that I may either, like him, express my
regret and swear that I never knew the bad doctrines of Origen, and that his infidelity has
now for the first time been made known to me by the Pope Theophilus; or that I may at
least prove that my opinions were sound and that he, as his habit is, had not understood
them. It is impossible that in my Commentaries on the Ephesians which I hear he makes
the ground of his accusation, I should have spoken both rightly and wrongly; that from the
same fountain should have proceeded both sweet water and bitter; and that whereas
throughout the work I condemned those who believe that souls have been created out of
angels, I should suddenly have forgotten myself and have defended the opinion which I
condemned before. He can hardly raise an objection to me on the score of folly, since he
has proclaimed me in his works as a man of the highest culture and eloquence; otherwise
such silly verbosity as he imputes is the part, one would think, of a pettifogger and a babbler
rather than of an eloquent man. What is the point of his written accusations I do not know,
for it is only report of them, not the writings, which has reached me; and, as the Apostle
tells us it is a foolish thing to beat the air. However, I must answer in the uncertainty till the
certainty reaches me: and I will begin by teaching my rival in my old age a lesson which I
learned in youth, that there are many forms of speech, and that, according to the subject
matter not only the sentences but the words also of writings vary.</p>

<p>16. For instance, Chrysippus and Antipater occupy themselves with thorny questions:
Demosthenes and Æschines speak with the voice of thunder against each other; Lysias and
Isocrates have an easy and pleasing style. There is a wonderful difference in these writers,
though each of them is perfect in his own line. Again: read the book of Tully To Herennius;
read his Rhetoricians; or, since he tells us that these books fell from his hands in a merely
inchoate and unfinished condition, look through his three books On the orator, in which
he introduces a discussion between Crassus and Antony, the most eloquent orators of that
day; and a fourth book called The Orator which he wrote to Brutus when already an old
man; and you will realize that History, Oratory, Dialogue, Epistolary writing, and Commentaries,
have, each of them, their special style. We have to do now with Commentaries. In
those which I wrote upon the Ephesians I only followed Origen and Didymus and Apollinarius,
(whose doctrines are very different one from another) so far as was consistent with
the sincerity of my faith: for what is the function of a Commentary? It is to interpret another
man’s words, to put into plain language what he has expressed obscurely. Consequently, it
enumerates the opinions of many persons, and says, Some interpret the passage in this sense,
some in that; the one try to support their opinion and understanding of it by such and such
evidence or reasons: so that the wise reader, after reading these different explanations, and
having many brought before his mind for acceptance or rejection, may judge which is the
truest, and, like a good banker, may reject the money of spurious mintage. Is the commentator
to be held responsible for all these different interpretations, and all these mutually
contradicting opinions because he puts down the expositions given by many in the single
work on which he is commenting? I suppose that when you were a boy you read the commentaries
of Asper upon Virgil and Sallust, those of Vulcatius upon Cicero’s Orations, of
Victorinus upon his Dialogues and upon the Comedies of Terence, and also those of my
master Donatus on Virgil, and of others on other writers such as Plautus, Lucretius, Flaccus,
Persius and Lucan. Will you find fault with those who have commented on these writers
because they have not held to a single explanation, but enumerate their own views and those
of others on the same passage?</p>

teaching Minerva, and the man carrying fagots into the wood. I only wonder that, being as
you are the Aristarchus3028 of our time, you should have shewn ignorance of these matters
which every boy knows. It is, no doubt, from your mind being fixed on the meaning of what
you write, but partly also from your being so sharp-sighted for the manufacture of calumnies
against me, that you despise the precepts of Grammarians and orators, that you make no
attempt to set straight words which have got transposed when the sentence has become
complicated, or to avoid some harsh collocation of consonants, or to escape from a style
full of gaps. It would be ridiculous to point to one or two wounds when the whole body is
enfeebled and broken. I will not select portions for criticism; it is for him to select any portion
which is free from faults. He must have been ignorant even of the Socratic saying: “Know

<p>Possibly he will swear that he has never learned to read and write; I can easily believe
that without an oath. Or perhaps he will take refuge in what the Apostle says of himself:
“Though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge.” But his reason for saying this is plain.
He had been trained in Hebrew learning and brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, whom,
though he had attained apostolic rank, he was not ashamed to call his master; and he thought
Greek eloquence of no account, or at all events, in his humility, he would not parade his
knowledge of it. So that3030 ‘his preaching should stand not in the persuasive wisdom of
words but in the power of the things signified.’ He despised other men’s riches since he was
rich in his own. Still it was not to an illiterate man who stumbled in every sentence that
Festus cried, as he stood before his judgment seat:</p>

<p>“Paul thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.”3031 You who can
hardly do more than mutter in Latin, and who rather creep like a tortoise than walk, ought
either to write in Greek, so that among those who are ignorant of Greek you may pass for
one who knows a foreign tongue; or else, if you attempt to write Latin, you should first have
a grammar-master, and flinch from the ferule, and begin again as an old scholar among
children to learn the art of speaking. Even if a man is bursting with the wealth of Croesus
and Darius, letters will not follow the money-bag. They are the companions of toil and of
labour, the associates of the fasting not of the full-fed, of self-mastery not of self-indul-
gence.3032 It is told of Demosthenes that he consumed more oil than wine, and that no
workman ever shortened his nights as he did. He for the sake of enunciating the single letter
Rho was willing to take a dog as his teacher; and yet you make it a crime in me that I took
a man to teach me the Hebrew letters. This is the sort of wisdom which makes men remain
unlearned: they do not choose to learn what they do not know. They forget the words of
Horace:

understanding.” The case is different with those who only wish to be read by the vulgar, and
do not care how they may offend the ears of the learned; and they despise the utterance of
the poet which brands the forwardness of noisy ignorance.

<p>18. Our friends take it amiss that I have spoken of the Origenists as confederated together
by orgies of false oaths. I named the book in which I had found it written, that is, the sixth
book of Origen’s Miscellanies, in which he tries to adapt our Christian doctrine to the
opinions of Plato. The words of Plato in the third book of the Republic3036 are as follows:
“Truth, said Socrates, is to be specially cultivated. If, however, as I was saying just now,
falsehood is disgraceful and useless to God, to men it is sometimes useful, if only it is used
as a stimulant3037 or a medicine; for no one can doubt that some such latitude of statement
must be allowed to physicians, though it must be taken out of the hands of those who are
unskilled. That is quite true, it was replied; and if one admits that any person may do this,
it must be the duty of the rulers of states at times to tell lies, either to baffle the enemy or to
benefit their country and the citizens. On the other hand to those who do not know how to
make a good use of falsehood, the practice should be altogether prohibited.” Now take the
words of Origen: “When we consider the precept3038 ‘Speak truth every man with his
neighbour,’ we need not ask, Who is my neighbour? but we should weigh well the cautious
remarks of the philosopher. He says, that to God falsehood is shameful and useless, but to
men it is occasionally useful. We must not suppose that God ever lies, even in the way of
economy;3039 only, if the good of the hearer requires it, he speaks in ambiguous language,
and reveals what he wills in enigmas, taking care at once that the dignity of truth should be
preserved and yet that what would be hurtful if produced nakedly before the crowd should
be enveloped in a veil and thus disclosed. But a man on whom necessity imposes the responsibility
of lying is bound to use very great care, and to use falsehood as he would a stimulant
or a medicine, and strictly to preserve its measure, and not go beyond the bounds observed
by Judith in her dealings with Holofernes, whom she overcame by the wisdom with which
she dissembled her words. He should act like Esther who changed the purpose of Artaxerxes
by having so long concealed the truth as to her race; and still more the patriarch Jacob who,
as we read, obtained the blessing of his father by artifice and falsehood. From all this it is
evident that if we speak falsely with any other object than that of obtaining by it some great
good, we shall be judged as the enemies of him who said, I am the truth.” This Origen wrote,
and none of us can deny it. And he wrote it in the book which he addressed to the ‘perfect,’
his own disciples. His teaching is that the master may lie, but the disciple must not. The inference
from this is that the man who is a good liar, and without hesitation sets before his

Second Psalm. In the Latin it stands: “Learn discipline,” in the Hebrew it is written Nescu
Bar; and I have given it in my commentary, Adore the Son; and then, when I translated the
whole Psalter into the Latin language, as if I had forgotten my previous explanation, I put
“Worship purely.” No one can deny, of course, that these interpretations are contrary to
each other; and we must pardon him for being ignorant of the Hebrew writing when he is
so often at a loss even in Latin. Nescu, translated literally, is Kiss. I wished not to give a distasteful
rendering, and preferring to follow the sense, gave the word Worship; for those who
worship are apt to kiss their hands and to bare their heads, as is to be seen in the case of Job
who declares that he has never done either of these things,3040 and says3041 “If I beheld the
sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart rejoiced in secret and
I kissed my hand with my mouth, which is a very great iniquity, and a lie to the most high
God.” The Hebrews, according to the peculiarity of their language use this word Kiss for
adoration; and therefore I translated according to the use of those whose language I was
dealing with. The word Bar, however in Hebrew has several meanings. It means Son, as in
the words Barjona (son of a dove) Bartholomew (son of Tholomæus), Bartimæus, Barjesus,
Barabbas. It also means Wheat, and A sheaf of corn, and Elect and Pure. What sin have I
committed, then, when a word is thus uncertain in its meaning, if I have rendered it differently
in different places? and if, after taking the sense “Worship the Son” in my Commentary,
where there is more freedom of discussion, I said “Worship purely” or “electively” in my
version of the Bible itself, so that I should not be thought to translate capriciously or give
grounds for cavil on the part of the Jews. This last rendering, moreover, is that of Aquila
and Symmachus: and I cannot see that the faith of the church is injured by the reader being
shewn in how many different ways a verse is translated by the Jews.</p>

<p>20. Your Origen allows himself to treat of the transmigration of souls, to introduce the
belief in an infinite number of worlds, to clothe rational creatures in one body after another,
to say that Christ has often suffered, and will often suffer again, it being always profitable
to undertake what has once been profitable. You also yourself assume such an authority as
to turn a heretic into a martyr, and to invent a heretical falsification of the books of Origen.
Why may not I then discuss about words, and in doing the work of a commentator teach
the Latins what I learn from the Hebrews? If it were not a long process and one which savours
of boasting, I should like even now to shew you how much profit there is in waiting at the
doors of great teachers, and in learning an art from a real artificer. If I could do this, you
would see what a tangled forest of ambiguous names and words is presented by the Hebrew.
It is this which gives such a field for various renderings: for, the sense being uncertain, each
man takes the translation which seems to him the most consistent. Why should I take you
to any outlandish writers? Go over Aristotle once more and Alexander the commentator
on Aristotle; you will recognize from reading these what a plentiful crop of uncertainties
exists; and you may then cease to find fault with your friend in reference to things which
you have never had brought to your mind even in your dreams.</p>

<p>21. My brother Paulinian tells me that our friend has impugned certain things in my
commentary on the Ephesians: some of these criticisms he committed to memory, and has
indicated the actual passages impugned. I must not therefore refuse to meet his statements,
and I beg the reader, if I am somewhat prolix in the statement and the refutation of his
charges, to allow for the necessary conditions of the discussion. I am not accusing another
but endeavouring to defend myself and to refute the false accusation of heresy which is
thrown in my teeth. On the Epistle to the Ephesians Origen wrote three books. Didymus
and Apollinarius also composed works of their own. These I partly translated, partly adapted;
my method is described in the following passage of my prologue: “This also I wish to state
in my Preface. Origen, you must know, wrote three books upon this Epistle, and I have
partly followed him. Apollinarius also and Didymus published certain commentaries on it,
from which I have culled some things, though but few; and, as seemed to me right, I put in
or took out others; but I have done this in such a way that the careful reader may from the
very first see how far the work is due to me, how far to others.” Whatever fault there is detected
in the exposition given of this Epistle, if I am unable to shew that it exists in the Greek
books from which I have stated it to have been translated into Latin, I will acknowledge that
the fault is mine and not another’s. However, that I should not be thought to be raising
quibbles, and by this artifice of self-excuse to be escaping from boldly meeting him, I will
set out the actual passages which are adduced as evidences of my fault.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">      
<pb n="1271"/>
<p>22. To begin. In the first book I take the words of Paul:3042 “As he hath chosen us before
the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and unspotted before him.” This I have
interpreted as referring not, according to Origen’s opinion, to an election of those who had
existed in a previous state, but to the foreknowledge of God; and I close the discussion with
these words:</p>
<p>“His assertion that we have been chosen before the foundation of the world that we
should be holy and without blemish before him, that is, before God, belongs to the foreknowledge
of God, to whom all things which are to be are already made, and are known before
they come into being. Thus Paul was predestinated in the womb of his mother: and
Jeremiah before his birth is sanctified, chosen, confirmed, and, as a type of Christ, sent as
a prophet to the Gentiles.”</p>
<p>There is no crime surely in this exposition of the passage. Origen explained it in a heterodox
sense, but I followed that of the church. And, since it is the duty of a commentator
to record the opinions expressed by many others, and I had promised in the Preface that I
would do this, I set down Origen’s interpretation, though without mentioning his name
which excites ill will.</p>
<p>“Another,” I said, “who wishes to vindicate the justice of God, and to shew that he does
not choose men according to a prejudgment and foreknowledge of his own but according
to the deserts of the elect, thinks that before the visible creation of sky, earth, sea and all that
is in them, there existed the invisible creation, part of which consisted of souls, which, for
certain causes known to God alone, were cast down into this valley of tears, this scene of
our affliction and our pilgrimage; and that it is to this that we may apply the Psalmist’s
prayer, he being in this low condition and longing to return to his former dwelling place:3043
“Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged; I have inhabited the habitations of Kedar, my
soul hath had a long pilgrimage.” And also the words of the Apostle:3044 “O wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” and3045 “It is better to return
and to be with Christ;” and3046 “Before I was brought low, I sinned.” He adds much more
of the same kind.”</p>
<p>Now observe that I said “Another who wishes to vindicate,” I did not say “who succeeds
in vindicating.” But if you find a stumbling block in the fact that I condensed a very long
discussion of Origen’s into a brief statement so as to give the reader a glimpse of his meaning;
<note type="footnote">3042 Eph. i. 4</note>

<note type="footnote">3046 Ps. cxix. 67</note>

<pb n="1272"/>
if you declare me to be a secret adherent of his because I have not left out anything which
he has said, I would ask you whether it was not necessary for me to do this, so as to avoid
your cavils. Would you not otherwise have declared that I had kept silence on matters on
which he had spoken boldly, and that in the Greek text his assertions were much stronger
than I represented? I therefore put down all that I found in the Greek text, though in a
shorter form, so that his disciples should have nothing which they could force upon the ears
of the Latins as a new thing; for it is easier for us to make light of things which we know
well than of things which take us unprepared. But after I had shewn Origen’s interpretations
of the passage, I concluded this section with words to which I beg your attention:</p>
<p>“The Apostle does not say ‘He chose us before the foundation of the world because we
were then holy and without blemish;’ but ‘He chose us that we might be holy and without
blemish,’ that is, that we who before were not holy and without blemish might afterwards
become such. This expression will apply even to sinners who turn to better things; and thus
the words remain true, ‘In thy sight shall no man living be justified,’ that is, no one in his
whole life, in the whole of the time that he has existed in the world. If the passage be thus
understood, it makes against the opinion that before the foundation of the world certain
souls were elected because of their holiness, and that they had none of the corruption of
sinners. It is evident that Paul and those like him were not elected because they were holy
and without blemish, but they were elected and predestinated so that in their after life, by
means of their works and their virtues, they should become holy and without blemish.”</p>
<p>Does any one dare, then, after this statement of my opinion, to accuse me of assent to
the heresy of Origen? It is now almost eighteen years since I composed those books, at a
time when the name of Origen was highly esteemed in the world, and when as yet his work
the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν had not reached the ears of the Latins: and yet I distinctly stated my belief
and pointed out what I did not agree with. Hence, even if my opponent could have pointed
out anything heretical in other places, I should be held guilty only of the fault of carelessness,
not of the perverse doctrines which both in this place and in my other works I have condemned.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">      
<pb n="1273"/>
<p>23. I will deal shortly with the second passage which my brother tells me has been marked
for blame, because the complaint is exceedingly frivolous, and bears on its face its calumnious
character. The passage3047 is that in which Paul declares that God “made him to sit at his
right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.”
After stating various expositions which have been given, I came to the offices of the ministers
of God, and spoke of the principalities and powers, the virtues and dominions: and I add:</p>
<p>“They must assuredly have others who are subject to them, who are under their power
and serve them, and are fortified by their authority: and this distribution of offices will exist
not only in the present world but in the world to come, so that each individual will rise or
fall from one step of advancement and honour to another, some ascending and some descending,
and will come successively under each of these powers, virtues, principalities, and
dominions.”</p>
<p>I then went on to describe the various divine offices and ministries after the similitude
of the palace of an earthly king, which I fully described; and I added:</p>
<p>“Can we suppose that God the Lord of lords and King of kings, is content with a single
order of servants? We speak of an archangel because there are other angels of whom he is
chief: and so there would be nothing said of Principalities, Powers and Dominions unless
it were implied that there were others of inferior rank.”</p>
<p>But, if he thinks that I became a follower of Origen because I mentioned in my exposition
these advancements and honours, these ascents and descents, increasings and diminishings;
I must point out that to say, as Origen does, that Angels and Cherubim and Seraphim are
turned into demons and men, is a very different thing from saying that the Angels themselves
have various offices allotted to them,—a doctrine which is not repugnant to that of the
church. Just as among men there are various degrees of dignity distinguished by the different
kinds of work, as the bishop, the presbyter and the other Ecclesiastical grades have each
their own order, while yet all are men; so we may believe that, while they all retain the dignity
of Angels, there are various degrees of eminence among them, without imagining that angels
are changed into men, and that men are new-made into angels.</p>

<p>24. A third passage with which he finds fault is that in which I gave a threefold interpretation
of the Apostle’s words:3048 “That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding
riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.” The first was my own opinion,
the second the opposite opinion held by Origen, the third the simple explanation given by
Apollinarius. As to the fact that I did not give their names, I must ask for pardon on the
ground that it was done through modesty. I did not wish to disparage men whom I was
partly following. and whose opinions I was translating into the Latin tongue. But, I said, the
diligent reader will at once search into these things and form his own opinion. And I repeated
at the end: Another turns to a different sense the words ‘That in the ages to come he might
shew the exceeding riches of his grace.’ “Ah,” you will say, “I see that in the character of the
diligent reader you have unfolded the opinions of Origen.” I confess that I was wrong. I
ought to have said not The diligent but The blasphemous reader. If I had anticipated that
you would adopt measures of this kind I might have done this, and so have avoided your
calumnious speeches. It is, I suppose, a great crime to have called Origen a diligent reader,
especially when I had translated seventy books of his and had praised him up to the sky,—for
doing which I had to defend myself in a short treatise3049 two years ago in answer to your
trumpeting of my praises. In those ‘praises’ which you gave me you laid it to my charge that
I had spoken of Origen as a teacher of the churches, and now that you speak in the character
of an enemy you think that I shall be afraid because you accuse me of calling him a diligent
reader. Why, even shopkeepers who are particularly frugal, and slaves who are not wasteful,
and the care-takers who made our childhood a burden to us and even thieves when they
are particularly clever, we speak of as diligent; and so the conduct of the unjust steward in
the Gospel is spoken of as wise. Moreover3050 “The children of this world are wiser than
the children of light,” and3051 “The serpent was wiser than all the beasts which the Lord
had made on the earth.”</p>

<p>25. The fourth ground of his censure is in the beginning of my Second Book, in which
I expounded the statement which St. Paul makes “For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus
Christ for you Gentiles.” The passage in itself is perfectly plain; and I give, therefore, only
that part of the comment on it which lends itself to malevolent remark:</p>
<p>“The words which describe Paul as the prisoner of Jesus Christ for the Gentiles may be
understood of his martyrdom, since it was when he was thrown into chains at Rome that
he wrote this Epistle, at the same time with those to Philemon and the Colossians and the
Philippians, as we have formerly shewn. Certainly we might adopt another sense, namely,
that, since we find this body in several places called the chain of the soul, in which it is held
as in a close prison, Paul may speak of himself as confined in the chains of the body, and so
that he could not return and be with Christ; and that thus he might perfectly fulfil his office
of preaching to the Gentiles. Some commentators, however, introduce another idea, namely,
that Paul, having been predestinated and consecrated from his mother’s womb, and before
he was born, to be a preacher to the Gentiles, afterwards took on the chains of the flesh.”</p>
<p>Here also, as before, I gave a three fold exposition of the passage: in the first my own
view, in the second the one supported by Origen, and the third the opinion of Apollinarius
going contrary to his doctrine. Read over the Greek commentaries. If you do not find the
fact to be as I state it, I will confess that I was wrong. What is my fault in this passage? The
same, I presume, as that to which I made answer before, namely, that I did not name those
whose views I quoted. But it was needless at each separate statement of the Apostle to give
the names of the writers whose works I had declared in the Preface that I meant to translate.
Besides, it is not an absurd way of understanding the passage, to say that the soul is bound
in the body until Christ returns and, in the glory of the resurrection, changes our corruptible
and mortal body for incorruption and immortality: for it is in this sense that the Apostle
uses the expression, “O wretched man that I am; who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” calling it the body of death because it is subject to vices and diseases, to disorders
and to death; until it rises with Christ in glory, and, having been nothing but fragile clay
before, becomes baked by the heat of the holy Spirit into a jar of solid consistency, thus
changing its grade of glory, though not its nature.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">      
<pb n="1276"/>
<p>26. The fifth passage selected by him for blame is the most important, that in which I
explain the statement of the Apostle.3052 “From whom all the body fitly framed and knit
together through every juncture of ministration, according to the working in due measure
of every several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.”
Here I summed up in a short sentence Origen’s exposition which is very long and goes over
the same ideas in various words, yet so as to leave out none of his illustrations or his assertions.
And when I had come to the end, I added:</p>
<p>“And so in the restitution of all things, when Jesus Christ the true physician comes to
restore to health the whole body of the Church, which now lies scattered and rent, every
one will receive his proper place according to the measure of his faith and his recognition
of the Son of God (the word ‘recognize’ implies that he had formerly known him and afterwards
had ceased to know him), and shall then begin to be what he once had been; yet not
in such a way as that, as held by another heresy, all should be placed in one rank, and, by a
renovating process, all become angels; but that each member, according to its own measure
and office shall become perfect: for instance, that the apostate angel shall begin to be that
which he was by his creation, and that man who had been cast out of paradise shall be restored
again to the cultivation of paradise;” and so on.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">

<p>27. I wonder that you with your consummate wisdom have not understood my method
of exposition. When I say, ‘But not in such a way that, as held by another heresy, all should
be placed in one rank, that is, all by a reforming process become angels,’ I clearly shew that
the things which I put forward for discussion are heretical, and that one heresy differs from
the other. Which (do you ask?) are the two heresies? The one is that which says that all
reasonable creatures will by a reforming process become angels; the other, that which asserts
that in the restitution of the world each thing will become what it was originally created; as
for instance that devils will again become angels, and that the souls of men will become such
as they were originally formed; that is, by the reforming process will become not angels but
that which God originally made them, so that the just and the sinners will be on an equality.
Finally, to shew you that it was not my own opinion which I was developing but two heresies
which I was comparing with one another, both of which I had found stated in the Greek, I
completed my discussion with this ending:</p>
<p>“These things, as I have said before, are more obscure in our tongue because they are
put in a metaphorical form in Greek; and in every metaphor, when a translation is made
word for word from one language into another, the budding sense of the word is choked as
it were with brambles.”</p>
<p>If you do not find in the Greek the very thought which I have expressed, I give you leave
to treat all that I say as my own.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">      
<pb n="1278"/>
<p>28. The sixth and last point which I am told that he brings against me (that is if my
brother has not left anything unreported) is that, in the interpretation of the Apostle’s
words,3053 “He that loveth his wife loveth himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but
nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church,” after my own simple explanation
I propounded the question raised by Origen, speaking his views though without mentioning
his name, and saying:</p>
<p>“I may be met by the objection that the statement of the Apostle is not true when he
says that no man hates his own flesh, since those who labour under the jaundice or consumption
or cancer or abscesses, prefer death to life, and hate their own bodies;” and my own
opinion follows immediately: “The words, therefore, may be more properly taken in a
metaphorical sense.”</p>
<p>When I say metaphorical, I mean to shew that what is said is not actually the case, but
that the truth is shadowed forth through a mist of allegory. However, I will set out the actual
words which are found in Origen’s third book: “We may say that the soul loves that flesh
which is to see the salvation of God, that it nourishes and cherishes it, and trains it by discipline
and satisfies it with the bread of heaven, and gives it to drink of the blood of Christ:
so that it may become well-liking through wholesome food, and may follow its husband
freely, without being weighed down by any weakness. It is by a beautiful image that the soul
is said to nourish and cherish the body as Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, since
it was he who said to Jerusalem:3054</p>
<p>“How often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings and thou wouldst not;” and that thus this corruptible may put on incorruption,
and that being poised lightly, as upon wings, may rise more easily into the air. Let us
men then cherish our wives, and let our souls cherish our bodies in a way as that wives may
be turned into men and bodies into spirits, and that there may be no difference of sex, but
that, as among the angels there is neither male nor female, so we, who are to be the Angels,
may begin to be here what it is promised that we shall be in heaven.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3053 Eph. v. 28, 29</note>
<note type="footnote">3054 Matt. xxiii. 37</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">      
<pb n="1279"/>
<p>29. The simple explanation of my own opinion in reference to the passage I stated before
in these words:</p>
<p>“Taking the simple sense of the words, we have a command, following on the precept
of mutual kindness between man and wife, that we should nourish and cherish our wives:
that is, that we should supply them with the food and clothing which are necessary.”</p>
<p>This is my own understanding of the passage. Consequently, my words imply that all
that follows after and might be brought up against me must be understood as spoken not
as my own view but that of my opponents. But it might be thought that my resolution of
the difficulty of the passage is too short and peremptory, and that it wraps the true sense,
according to what has been said above, in the darkness of allegory, so as to bring it down
from its true meaning to one less true. I will therefore come nearer to the matter, and ask
what there is in the other interpretation with which you need disagree. It is this I suppose,
that I said that souls should cherish their bodies as men cherish their wives, so that this
corruptible may put on incorruption, and that, being lightly poised as upon wings, it may
rise more easily into the air. When I say that this corruptible must put on incorruption, I
do not change the nature of the body, but give it a higher rank in the scale of being. And so
as regards what follows, that, being lightly poised as upon wings, it may more easily rise
into the air: He who gets wings, that is, immortality, so that he may fly more lightly up to
heaven, does not cease to be what he had been. But you may say, I am staggered by what
follows:</p>
<p>“Let us men then cherish our wives, and let our souls cherish our bodies, in such a way
as that wives may be turned into men and bodies into spirits, and that there may be no difference
of sex, but that, as among the angels there is neither male nor female, so we, who
are to be like the angels, may begin to be on earth what it is promised that we shall be in
heaven.”</p>
<p>You might justly be staggered, if I had not, after what goes before, said “We may begin
to be what it is promised that we shall be in heaven.” When I say, “We shall begin to be on
earth,” I do not take away the difference of sex; I only take away lust, and sexual intercourse,
as the Apostle does when he says, “The time is short; it remaineth therefore that those who
have wives be as though they had none;” and as the Lord implied when, in reply to the
question of which of the seven brothers the woman would be the wife, he answered:3055 “Ye
err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God; for in the resurrection they shall
neither marry nor be given in marriage: but they shall be as the angels of God.” And, indeed,
when chastity is observed between man and woman, it begins to be true that there is neither
male nor female; but, though living in the body, they are being changed into angels, among
<note type="footnote">3055 Matt. xxii</note>

<pb n="1280"/>
whom there is neither male nor female. The same is said by the same Apostle in another
place:3056 “As many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. There can be
neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female:
for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”</p>

<p>30. But now, since my pleading has steered its course out of these rough and broken
places, and I have refuted the charge of heresy which had been urged against me by looking
my accuser freely in the face, I will pass on to the other articles of charge with which he tries
to assail me. The first is that I am a scurrilous person, a detractor of every one; that I am
always snarling and biting at my predecessors. I ask him to name a single person whose
reputation I have disparaged, or whom, according to an art practised by my opponent, I
have galled by pretended praise. But, if I speak against ill-disposed persons, and wound with
the point of my pen some Luscius Lanuvinus3057 or an Asinius Pollio of the race of the
Cornelii,3058 if I repel the attacks of a man of boastful and curious spirit, and aim all my
shafts at a single butt, why does he divide with others the wounds meant for him alone?
And why is he so unwise as to shew, by the irritation of his answer to my attack, his consciousness
that it is he alone whom the cap fits?</p>
<p>He brings against me the charge of perjury and sacrilege together, because, in a book
written for the instruction of one of Christ’s virgins, I describe the promise which I once
made when I dreamed that I was before the tribunal of the Judge, that I would never again
pay attention to secular literature, and that nevertheless I have sometimes made mention
of the learning which I then condemned. I think that I have here lighted on the man who,
under the name of Sallustianus Calpurnius, and through the letter written to me by the
orator Magnus, raised a not very3059 great question. My answer on the general subject is
contained in the short treatise which I then wrote to him.3060 But at the present moment I
must make answer as to the sacrilege and perjury of my dream. I said that I would thenceforward
read no secular books: it was a promise for the future, not the abolition of my
memory of the past. How, you may ask me, can you retain what you have been so long
without reading? I must give my answer by recurring to one of these old books:3061</p>
<p>’Tis much to be inured in tender youth.</p>
<p>But by this mode of denial I criminate myself; for bringing Virgil as my witness I am
accused by my own defender. I suppose I must weave a long web of words to prove what
<note type="footnote">3057 A rival of Terence, to whom Jerome often compares Rufinus.</note>

or, as he boasts, of the stock of Asinius Pollio, is said to have accused me at Rome long ago for having translated

each man is conscious of. Which of us does not remember his infancy? I shall make you
laugh though you are a man of such extreme gravity; and you will have at last to do as Crassus
did, who, Lucilius tells us, laughed but once in his life, if I recount the memories of my
childhood: how I ran about among the offices where the slaves worked; how I spent the
holidays in play; or how I had to be dragged like a captive from my grandmother’s lap to
the lessons of my enraged Orbilius.3062 You may still more be astonished if I say that, even
now that my head is gray and bald, I often seem in my dreams to be standing, a curly youth,
dressed in my toga, to declaim a controversial thesis before the master of rhetoric; and, when
I wake, I congratulate myself on escaping the peril of making a speech. Believe me, our infancy
brings back to us many things most accurately. If you had had a literary education, your
mind would retain what it was originally imbued with as a wine cask retains its scent. The
purple dye on the wool cannot be washed out with water. Even asses and other brutes know
the inns they have stopped at before, however long the journey may have been. Are you astonished
that I have not forgotten my Latin books when you learnt Greek without a master?
I learned the seven forms of Syllogisms in the Elements of logic; I learned the meaning of
an Axiom, or as it might be called in Latin a Determination; I learned how every sentence
must have in it a verb and a noun; how to heap up the steps of the Sorites,3063 how to detect
the clever turns of the Pseudomenos3064 and the frauds of the stock sophisms. I can swear
that I never read any of these things after I left school. I suppose that, to escape from having
what I learned made into a crime, I must, according to the fables of the poets, go and drink
of the river Lethe. I summon you, who accuse me for my scanty knowledge, and who think
yourself a litérateur and a Rabbi, tell me how was it that you dared to write some of the
things you have written, and to translate Gregory,3065 that most eloquent man, with a
splendour of eloquence like his own? Whence have you obtained that flow of words, that
lucidity of statement, that variety of translations,—you who in youth had hardly more than
a first taste of rhetoric? I must be very much mistaken if you do not study Cicero in secret.
I suspect that, being yourself so cultivated a person, you forbid me under penalties the
reading of Cicero, so that you may be left alone among our church writers to boast of your
flow of eloquence. I must say, however, that you seem rather to follow the philosophers, for
your style is akin to that of the thorny sentences of Cleanthes3066 and the contortions of
Chrysippus,3067 not from any art, for of that you say you are ignorant, but from the sympathy

fatuity; on this side, therefore, you are an Epicurean, and the principle of your eloquence
is, not style but matter. For, indeed, what does it matter that no one else understands what
you wish to say, when you write for your own friends alone, not for all? I must confess that
I myself do not always understand what you write, and think that I am reading3068 Heraclitus;

<p>31. I might well reply as I have done even if it were a question of a promise made with
full consciousness. But this is a new and shameless thing; he throws in my teeth a mere
dream. How am I to answer? I have no time for thinking of anything outside my own sphere.
I wish that I were not prevented from reading even the Holy Scriptures by the throngs that
beset this place, and the gathering of Christians from all parts of the world. Still, when a
man makes a dream into a crime, I can quote to him the words of the Prophets, who say
that we are not to believe dreams; for even to dream of adultery does not condemn us to
hell, and to dream of the crown of martyrdom does not raise us to heaven. Often I have seen
myself in dreams dead and placed in the grave: often I have flown over the earth and been
carried as if swimming through the air, over mountains and seas. My accuser might, therefore,
demand that I should cease to live, or that I should have wings on my shoulders, because
my mind has often been mocked in sleep by vague fancies of this kind. How many people
are rich while asleep and wake to find themselves beggars! or are drinking water to cool
their thirst, and wake up with their throats parched and burning! You exact from me the
fulfilment of a promise given in a dream. I will meet you with a truer and closer question:
Have you done all that you promised in your baptism? Have you or I fulfilled all that the
profession of a monk demands? I beg you, think whether you are not looking at the mote
in my eye through the beam in your own. I say this against my will; it is by sorrow that my
reluctant tongue is forced into words. As to you, it is not enough for you to make up charges
about my waking deeds, but you must accuse me for my dreams. You have such an interest
in my actions that you must discuss what I have said or done in my sleep. I will not dwell
on the way in which, in your zeal to speak against me, you have besmirched your own profession,
and have done all you can by word and deed for the dishonouring of the whole body
of Christians. But I give you fair warning, and will repeat it again and again. You are attacking
a creature who has horns: and, if it were not that I lay to heart the words of the Apostle3069
“The evil speakers3070 shall not inherit the kingdom of God,” and3071 “By hating one another
you have been consumed one of another,” I would make you feel what a vast discord you
have stirred up after a slight and pretended reconciliation. What advantage is it to you to
heap up slanders against me both among friends and strangers? Is it because I am not an
Origenist, and do not believe that I sinned in heaven, that I am accused as a sinner upon
earth? And was the result of our renewal of friendship to be, that I was not to speak against
heretics for fear that my notice of them should be taken for an assault upon you? So long
as I did not refuse to be belauded by you, you followed me as a master, you called me friend
and brother, and acknowledged me as a catholic in every respect. But when I asked to be

spared your praises, and judged myself unworthy to have such a great man for my trumpeter,
you immediately ran your pen through what you had written, and began to abuse all that
you had praised before, and to pour forth from the same mouth both sweet and bitter words.
I wish you could understand what self-repression I am exerting in not suiting my words to
the boiling heat of my breast; and how I pray, like the Psalmist:3072 “Set a watch, O Lord,
before my mouth, keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to the words of malice;”
and, as he says elsewhere:3073 “While the wicked stood before me I was dumb and was
humbled and kept silence even from good words;” and again:3074 “I became as a man that
heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.” But for me the Lord the Avenger will
reply, as he says through the Prophet:3075 “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord”:
and in another place:3076 “Thou satest and spakest against thy brother, and hast slandered
thy mother’s son. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest indeed
by that I should be such an one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set them before thine
eyes;” so that you may see yourself brought in guilty of those things which you falsely lay
to another’s charge.</p>

<p>32. I am told, to take another point, that one of his followers, Chrysogonus, finds fault
with me for having said that in baptism all sins are put away,3077 and, in the case of the man
who was twice married, that he had died and risen up a new man in Christ; and further that
there were several such persons who were Bishops in the churches. I will make him a short
answer. He and his friends have in their hands my letter, for which they take me to task. Let
him give an answer to it, let him overthrow its reasoning by reasoning of his own, and prove
my writings false by his writings. Why should he knit his brow and draw in and wrinkle up
his nostrils, and weigh out his hollow words, and simulate among the common crowd a
sanctity which his conduct belies? Let me proclaim my principles once more in his ears:
That the old Adam dies completely in the laver of baptism, and a new man rises then with
Christ; that the man that is earthly perishes and the man from heaven is raised up. I say this
not because I myself have a special interest in this question, through the mercy of Christ;
but that I made answer to my brethren when they asked me for my opinion, not intending
to prescribe for others what they may think right to believe, nor to overturn their resolution
by my opinion. For we who lie hid in our cells do not covet the Bishop’s office. We are not
like some, who, despising all humility, are eager to buy the episcopate with gold; nor do we
wish, with the minds of rebels, to suppress the Pontiff chosen by God;3078 nor do we, by
favouring heretics, show that we are heretics ourselves. As for money, we neither have it
nor desire to have it.3079 “Having food and clothing, we are therewith content;” and meanwhile
we constantly chant the words describing the man who shall ascend to the hill of the
Lord:3080 “He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent;
he who doeth these things shall not be moved eternally.” We may add that he who
does the opposite to these will fall eternally.</p>
<p>Almost every sentence in this last chapter is an insidious allusion to Rufinus. His
“wrinkled-up brow” and “turned-up nose,” his weighing out his words, his supposed wealth,
are all alluded to in other places and especially in the satirical description of him given after
his death in Jerome’s letter (cxxv. c. 18) to Rusticus.</p>
<note type="footnote">3077 The allusion is to Jerome’s letter (LXIX) to Oceanus on the case of Carterius a Spanish Bishop, who had
been married before his baptism, and, his wife having died, had married again. Oceanus argued that he was to

by baptism.</note>

<head>Book II.</head>
<p>Summary of the Chapters.</p>
<p>1–3. A criticism on Rufinus’ Apology to Anastasius. His excuses for not coming to Rome
are absurd. His parents are dead and the journey is easy. No one ever heard
before of his being imprisoned or exiled for the faith.</p>
<p>4–8. His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about the Trinity, but
about Origen’s doctrines of the Resurrection, the origin of souls, and the salvability
of Satan. As to the Resurrection and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to
souls he professes ignorance.</p>
<p>9. What Latin! The poor souls must be tormented by his barbarisms.</p>
<p>10. It is not permitted to you to be ignorant of such a matter which all the churches
know.</p>
<p>11. As to translating the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, it is not a question, but a charge that you unjustifiably
altered the book.</p>
<p>12, 13. Origen asserts Christ to be a creature, and maintains universal restitution. Where
has he contradicted this?</p>
<p>14. The question is, as Anastasius says to John of Jerusalem, with what motive you
translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</p>
<p>15. You pretend not to be Origen’s defender, but you publish and enlarge the Apology
for him and allege the heretics’ falsification of his works.</p>
<p>16. Your defence gains no support from Eusebius or Didymus, who, each for his own
reason, defend the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν as it stands.</p>
<p>17. If we may allege falsification at every turn we make a chaos of all past literature.</p>
<p>18. The object of Origen’s letter, of which he translates only a part, is not to shew the
falsification of his writings but to vituperate the Bishops who condemned him.</p>
<p>19. It is only in reference to a particular point in his dispute with Candidus that Origen
alleges this falsification. The story of Hilary’s being condemned through his
writings having been falsified has no foundation.</p>
<p>20. That which you tell about myself in Damasus’ council is mere after-dinner gossip.
21–2. The attack on Epiphanius as a plagiarist of Origen is an outrage on the Bishops
generally. Origen never wrote 6000 books.</p>
<p>23. I ascertained at the library at Cæsarea that the Apology you quote as Pamphilus’ is
the work of Eusebius.</p>
<p>24. The letter falsely circulated in Africa as mine, and expressing regret for my translation
of the Old Test. from the Hebrew bears the mark of your hand. I have always
honoured the Seventy Translators.</p>

<pb n="1288"/>
<p>25–32. In proof of this, I bring forward the prefaces to my Translation of the Books
from Genesis to Isaiah.</p>
<p>33. As to Daniel, it was necessary to point out that Bel and the Dragon, and similar
stories were not found in the Hebrew.</p>
<p>34. A vindication of the importance of the Hebrew Text of Scripture.</p>
<p>35. Though the LXX has been of great value, we should be grateful for fresh translations
from the original.</p>

<p>1. Thus far I have made answer about my crimes, and indeed in defence of my crimes,
which my crafty encomiast formerly urged against me, and which his disciples still constantly
press. I have done so not as well as I ought but as I was able, putting a check upon my
complaints, for my object has been not so much to accuse others as to defend myself. I will
now come to his Apology,3081 by which he strives to justify himself to Anastasius, Bishop
of the City of Rome, and, in order to defend himself, constructs a mass of calumnies against
me. His love for me is like that which a man who has been carried away by the tempest and
nearly drowned in deep water feels for the strong swimmer at whose foot he clutches: he is
determined that I shall sink or swim with him.</p>

<p>2. He professes in the first place to be replying to insinuations made at Rome against
his orthodoxy, he being a man most fully approved in respect both of divine faith and of
charity. He says that he would have wished to come himself, were it not that he had lately
returned, after thirty years’ absence, to his parents, and that it would have seemed harsh
and inhuman to leave them after having been so long in coming to them; and also if he had
not become somewhat less robust through his long and toilsome journey, and too infirm
to begin his labours again. As he had not been able to come himself, he had sent his apology
as a kind of literary cudgel which the bishop might hold in his hand and drive away the dogs
who were raging against him. If he is a man approved for his divine faith and charity by all,
and especially by the Bishop to whom he writes; how is it that at Rome he is assailed and
reviled, and that the reports of the attacks upon his reputation grow thicker. Further, what
sort of humility is this, that a man speaks of himself as approved for his divine faith and
charity? The Apostles prayed,3082 “Lord increase our faith,” and received for answer: “If ye
had faith as a grain of mustard seed;” and even to Peter it is said:3083 “O thou of little faith,
wherefore didst thou doubt?” Why should I speak of charity, which is greater than either
faith or hope, and which Paul says he hopes for rather than assumes: without which even
the blood shed in martyrdom and the body given up to the flames has no reward to crown
it. Yet both of these our friend claims as his own: in such a way, however, that there still remain
creatures who bark against him, and who will go on barking unless the illustrious
Pontiff drives them away with his stick. But how absurd is this plea which he puts forward,
of having returned to his parents after thirty years. Why, he has got neither father nor
mother! He left them alive when he was a young man, and, now that he is old, he pines for
them when they are dead. But perhaps, he means by “parents,” what is meant in the talk of
the soldiers and the common people, his kinsfolk and relations; well, he says he does not
wish to be thought so harsh and inhuman as to desert them; and therefore he leaves his
home3084 and goes to live at Aquileia. That most approved faith of his is in great peril at
Rome, and yet he lies on his back, being a bit tired after thirty years, and cannot make that
very easy journey in a carriage along that Flaminian Way. He puts forward his lassitude
after his long journey, as if he had done nothing but move about for thirty years, or as if,
after resting at Aquileia for two years, he was still worn out with the labour of his past travels.</p>

<p>3. I will touch upon the other points, and set down the actual words of his letter:</p>
<p>“Although my faith was proved, at the time of the persecution by the heretics, when I
was living in the holy church of Alexandria, by imprisonments and exiles, to which I was
subjected because of the faith.”</p>
<p>I only wonder that he did not add3085 “The prisoner of Jesus Christ,” or “I was delivered
from the jaw of the lion,” or “I fought with beasts at Alexandria,” or “I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.”
What exiles, what imprisonments are these which he describes? I blush for this open falsehood.
As if imprisonment and exile would be inflicted without judicial sentences! I should
like to have a list of these imprisonments and of the various provinces to which he tells us
that he was forced into exile. Next there appear to have been numerous imprisonments and
an infinite number of exiles; so that he might at least name one of them all. Let us have the
acts of his confessorship produced, for hitherto we have been in ignorance of them; and so
let us have the satisfaction of reciting his deeds with those of the other martyrs of Alexandria,
and that he may be able to meet the people who bark against him with the words:3086 “From
henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>4. He goes on:</p>
<p>“Still, since there may be some persons, who may wish to prove my faith, or to hear and
learn what it is, I will declare that I thus think of the Trinity;”</p>
<p>and so on. At first you said that you entrusted your faith to the Bishop as a stick with
which he might fortify himself on your behalf against those barking dogs. Now you speak
a little less confidently, “There may be some persons who wish to prove my faith.” You begin
to hesitate when the barkings which reach your ears are so numerous. I will not stop to
discuss the forms of diction which you use, for these you look down upon and condemn: I
will answer according to the meaning alone. You are asked about one thing, and you give
account for yourself upon another. As to the doctrines of Arius, you contended against them
at Alexandria a long time ago, by imprisonment and exile, not with words but with blood.
But the question now relates to the heresy of Origen, and the feeling aroused against you
on the subject. I should be sorry that you should trouble yourself to cure wounds which are
already healed. You confess a Trinity in one Godhead. The whole world now confesses this,
and I think that even the devils confess that the Son of God was born of the Virgin Mary,
and took upon him the flesh and the soul belonging to human nature. But I must beg you
not to think me a contentious man if I examine you a little more strictly. You say that the
Son of God took the flesh and soul belonging to human nature. Well then, I would ask you
not to be vexed with me but to answer this question. That soul which Jesus took upon him,
did it exist before it was born of Mary? Was it created together with the body in that original
Virgin nature which was begotten by the Holy Spirit? or, when the body was already formed
within the womb, was it made all at once, and sent down from heaven? I wish to know which
one of these you choose as your opinion. If it existed before it was born from Mary, then it
was not yet the soul of Jesus; and it was employed in some way, and, for a reward of its virtues,
it was made his soul. If it arose by traduction,3087 then human souls, which we believe to
be eternal, are subject to the same condition as those of the brutes, which perish with the
body. But if it is created and sent into the body after the body has been formed, tell us so
simply, and free us from anxiety.</p>
<note type="footnote">3087 Ex traduce, that is, from a layer like that of the vine. This embodies the view that the soul is derived,
with the body, from the parent. There is no English word for the process; and since the word Traducianism is
used to express the theory, ‘Traduction’ is used here to express the process.</note>

<p>5. None of these answers will you give us. You turn to other things, and by your tricks
and shew of words prevent us from paying close attention to the question. What! you will
say, was not the question about the resurrection of the flesh and the punishment of the
devil? True; and therefore I ask for a brief and sincere answer. I raise no question as to your
declaration that it is this very flesh in which we live which rises again, without the loss of a
single member, and without any part of the body being cut off (for these are your own
words). But I want to know whether you hold, what Origen denies, that the bodies rise with
the same sex with which they died; and that Mary will still be Mary and John be John; or
whether the sexes will be so mixed and confused that there will be neither man nor woman,
but something which is both or neither; and also whether you hold that the bodies remain
uncorrupt and immortal, and, as you acutely suggest after the Apostle, spiritual bodies
forever; and not only the bodies, but the actual flesh, with blood infused into it, and passing
by channels through the veins and bones,—such flesh as Thomas touched; or that little by
little they are dissolved into nothing, and reduced into the four elements of which they were
compounded. This you ought either to confess or deny, and not to say what Origen also
says, but insincerely, as if he were playing upon the weakness of fools and children, “without
the loss of a single member or the cutting off of any part of the body.” Do you suppose that
what we feared was that we might rise without noses and ears, that we should find that our
genital organs would be cut off or maimed and that a city of eunuchs was built up in the
new Jerusalem?</p>

<p>6. Of the devil he thus frames his opinion:</p>
<p>“We affirm also a judgment to come, in which judgment every man is to receive the
due meed of his bodily life, according to that which he has done, whether good or evil. And,
if in the case of men the reward is according to their works how much more will it be so in
the case of the devil who is the universal cause of sin. Of the devil himself our belief is that
which is written in the Gospel, namely that both he and all his angels will receive as their
portion the eternal fire, and with him those who do his works, that is, who become the accusers
of their brethren. If then any one denies that the devil is to be subjected to eternal
fires, may he have his part with him in the eternal fire, so that he may know by experience
the fact which he now denies.”</p>
<p>I will repeat the words one by one. “We affirm also a judgment to come, in which
judgment U+0026c.” I had determined to say nothing about verbal faults. But, since his disciples
admire the eloquence of their master, I will make one or two strictures upon it. He had
already said “a future judgment;” but, being a cautious man, he was afraid of saying simply
“in which,” and therefore wrote “in which judgment;” for fear that, if he had not said
“judgment” a second time, we, forgetting what had gone before, might have supplied the
word “ass.” That which he brings in afterwards “those who become the accusers of their
brethren will with him have their portion in the eternal fire,” is in a style of equal beauty.
Who ever heard of ‘possessing3088 the flames’? It would be like ‘enjoying tortures.’ I suppose
that, being now a Greek, he had tried to translate himself, and that for the word
κληρονομήσουσιν,3089 which can be rendered in Latin by the single word Hæreditabunt,
he said Hæreditate potientur3090 supposing it to be something more elaborate and ornate.
With such trifles and such improprieties of speech his whole discourse is teeming. But to
return to the meaning of his words.</p>
<note type="footnote">3088 Potiri, rendered above ‘have their portion.’</note>
<note type="footnote">3089 Kleronomesousin, they shall inherit.</note>
<note type="footnote">3090 They will enjoy the inheritance.</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">     
<pb n="1295"/>
<p>7. To proceed:</p>
<p>“This is a great spear with which the devil is pierced, he, ‘who is the universal cause of
sin,’ if he is to render account of his works, like a man, and ‘with his angels possess the inheritance
of eternal fires.’ This, no doubt, was what was lacking to him, that, having brought
mankind into torment, he should himself ‘possess the eternal fires’ which he had all the
while been longing for.”</p>
<p>You seem to me here to speak a little too hardly of the devil, and to assail the accuser
of all with false accusations. You say ‘he is the universal cause of sin;’ and, while you make
him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault, and take away the freedom of the will.
Our Lord says that3091 ‘from our heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
thefts, false witnesses, railings,’ and of Judas we read in the Gospel;3092 “After the
sop Satan entered into him,” that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and
had not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the forbearance of
the Saviour. So also the Apostle says;3093 “Such men I delivered to Satan, that they might
be taught not to blaspheme.” He delivered to Satan as to a torturer, with a view to their
punishment, those who, before they had been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by
their own will. David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his
own will and the incentives of vice when he says3094 “Cleanse thou me from my secret faults,
and keep back thy servant from alien sins.” We read also in Ecclesiastes3095 “If the spirit of
a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;” from which we may clearly see that we
commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down
headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is,
those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you
do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you,
is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think,
what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners’ conscience,
and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the
words of Isaiah:3096 “Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.” And in
<note type="footnote">3091 Matt. xv. 19</note>

<pb n="1296"/>
the words addressed to Babylon:3097 “Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these
shall be thy help.” So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;3098 “What shall be given to
thee, or what shall be done more for thee against the false tongue? Sharp arrows of the
mighty, with desolating coals;” which means (according to him) that the arrows of God’s
precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,3099 “I lived in misery while
a thorn pierces me”) should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end
of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:3100 “I came to send
fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn” as meaning “I wish that all may repent,
and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is
written,3101 “Our God is a consuming fire;” it is no great thing then to say this of the devil,
since it is prepared also for men.” You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the
suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;3102 “Thou hast become perdition and
shalt not be for ever;” and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,3103 “Behold his
hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one
that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return
it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his words that
are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.” Hence, these things may pass as the work
of a plain man. Their bearing is evident enough to those who understand these matters; but
to the unlearned they may wear the appearance of innocence.</p>

<p>8. But what follows about the condition of souls can by no means be excused. He says:</p>
<p>“I am next informed that some stir has been made on the question of the nature of the
soul. Whether complaints on a matter of this kind ought to be entertained instead of being
put aside, you must yourself decide. If, however, you desire to know my opinion upon this
subject, I will state it frankly. I have read a great many writers on this question, and I find
that they express divers opinions. Some of these whom I have read hold that the soul is infused
together with the material body through the channel of the human seed, and of this
they give such proofs as they can. I think that this was the opinion of Tertullian or Lactantius
among the Latins, perhaps also of a few others. Others assert that God is every day making
new souls and infusing them into the bodies which have been framed in the womb; while
others again believe that the souls were all made long ago, when God made all things of
nothing, and that all that he now does is to send out each soul to be born in its body as it
seems good to him. This is the opinion of Origen, and of some others among the Greeks.
For myself, I declare in the presence of God that, after reading each of these opinions, I am
unable to hold any of them as certain and absolute: the determination of the truth in this
question I leave to God and to any to whom it shall please him to reveal it. My profession
on this point is, therefore, first, that these several opinions are those which I have found in
books, but, secondly, that I as yet remain in ignorance on the subject, except so far as this,
505
that the Church delivers it as an article of faith that God is the creator of souls as well as of
bodies.”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">     
<pb n="1298"/>
<p>9. Before I enter upon the subject matter of this passage, I must stand in admiration of
words worthy of Theophrastus:</p>
<p>“I am informed, he says, that some stir has been made on the question of the nature of
the soul. Whether complaints on a matter of this kind ought to be entertained instead of
being put aside, you must yourself decide.”</p>
<p>If these questions as to the origin of the soul have been stirred at Rome, what is the
meaning of this complaint and murmuring on the question whether they ought to be entertained
or not, a question which belongs entirely to the discretion of bishops? But perhaps
he thinks that question and complaint mean the same thing, because he finds this form of
speech in the Commentaries of Caper. Then he writes: “Some of those whom I have read
hold that the soul is infused together with the material body through the channel of the
human seed; and of these they give such proofs as they can.” What license have we here in
the forms of speech! What mixing of the moods and tenses!3104 “I have read some sayings—
they confirmed them with what assertions they could.” And in what follows: “Others
assert that God is every day making new souls and infusing them into the bodies which have
been framed in the womb; while others again believe that the souls were all made long ago
when God made all things of nothing, and that all that he now does is to send out each soul
to be born in its body as seems good to him.” Here also we have a most beautiful arrangement.
Some, he says, assert this and that; some declare that the souls were made long ago, that is,
when God made all things of nothing, and that He now sends them forth to be born in their
own body as it pleases him. He speaks so distastefully and so confusedly that I have more
trouble in correcting his mistakes than he in writing them. At the end he says: “I, however,
though I have read these things;” and, while the sentence still hangs unfinished, he adds, as
if he had brought forward something fresh: “I, however, do not deny that I have both read
each of these things, and as yet confess that I am ignorant.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3104 The words are translated literally here, so as to shew how they lend themselves to Jerome’s strictures.</note>

<p>10. Unhappy souls! stricken through with all these barbarisms as with so many lances!
I doubt whether they had so much trouble when, according to the erroneous theory of
Origen, they tell from heaven to earth, and were clothed in these gross bodies, as they have
now in being knocked about on all sides by these strange words and sentences: not to
mention that word of ill omen which says that they are infused through the channel of the
human seed. I know that it is not usual in Christian writings to criticise mere faults of style;
but I thought it well to shew by a few examples how rash it is to teach what you are ignorant
of, to write what you do not know: so that, when we come to the subject-matter, we may be
prepared to find the same amount of wisdom. He sends a letter, which he calls a very strong
stick, as a weapon for the Bishop of Rome; and on the very subject about which the dogs
are barking at him he professes entire ignorance of the question. If he is ignorant on the
subject for which ill-reports are current against him, what need was there for him to send
an Apology, which contains no defence of himself, but only a confession of his ignorance?
This course is calculated to sow a crop of suspicions, not to calm them. He gives us three
opinions about the origin of souls; and his conclusion at the end is: “I do not deny that I
have read each of them, and I confess that I still am ignorant.” You would suppose him to
be Arcesilaus3105 or Carneades3106 who declare that there is no certainty; though he surpasses
even them in his cautiousness; for they were driven by the intolerable ill-will which they
aroused among philosophers for taking all truth out of human life, to invent the doctrines
of probability, so that by making their probable assertions they might temper their agnosticism;
but he merely says that he is uncertain, and does not know which of these opinions
is true. If this was all the answer he had to make, what could have induced him to invoke
so great a Pontiff as the witness of his lack of theological culture. I presume this is the lassitude
about which he tells us that he is exhausted with his thirty-years journey and cannot come
to Rome. There are a great many things of which we are all ignorant; but we do not ask for
witnesses of our ignorance. As to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as to the nativity of our
Lord and Saviour, about which Isaiah cries,3107 “Who shall declare his generation?” he
speaks boldly, and a mystery of which all past ages knew nothing he claims as quite within
his knowledge: this alone he does not know, the ignorance of which causes men to stumble.
As to how a virgin became the mother of God, he has full knowledge; as to how he himself
was born he knows nothing. He confesses that God is the maker of souls and bodies,
whether souls existed before bodies or whether they came into being with the germs of

bodies, or are sent into them when they are already formed in the womb. In any case we
recognize God as their author. The question at issue is not whether the souls were made by
God or by another, but which of the three opinions which he states is true. Of this he professes
ignorance. Take care! You may find people saying that the reason for your confession of
your ignorance of the three is that you do not wish to be compelled to condemn one. You
spare Tertullian and Lactantius so as not to condemn Origen with them. As far as I remember
(though I may be mistaken) I am not aware of having read that Lactantius spoke of the soul
as planted at the same time as the body.3108 But, as you say that you have read it, please to
tell me in what book it is to be found, so that you may not be thought to have calumniated
him in his death as you have me in my slumber. But even here you walk with a cautious and
hesitating step. You say: “I think that, among the Latins, Tertullian or Lactantius held this
opinion, perhaps also some others.” You not only are in doubt about the origin of souls,
but you have only ‘thoughts’ as to the opinion which each writer holds: yet the matter is of
some importance. On the question of the soul, however, you openly proclaim your ignorance,
and confess your untaught condition: as to the authors, your knowledge amounts only to
‘thinking,’ hardly to ‘presuming.’ But as to Origen alone you are quite clear. “This is Origen’s
opinion,” you say. But, let me ask you: Is the opinion sound or not? Your reply is, “I do not
know.” Then why do you send me messengers and letter-carriers, who are constantly coming,
merely to teach me that you are ignorant? To prevent the possibility of my doubting
whether your incapacity is as great as you say, and thinking it possible that you are cunningly
concealing all you know, you take an oath in the presence of God that up to the present
moment you hold nothing for certain and definite on this subject, and that you leave it to
God to know what is true, and to any one to whom it may please Him to reveal it. What!
Through all these ages does it seem to you that there has been no one worthy of having this
revealed to him? Neither patriarch, nor prophet, nor apostle, nor martyr? Were not these
mysteries made clear even to yourself when you dwelt amidst princes and exiles? The Lord
says in the Gospel:3109 “Father, I have revealed thy name to men.” Did he who revealed the
Father keep silence on the origin of souls? And are you astonished if your brethren are
scandalized when you swear that you know nothing of a thing which the churches of Christ
profess to know?3110</p>

<p>11. After the exposition of his faith, or rather his lack of knowledge, he passes on to
another matter; and tries to make excuses for having turned the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν into
Latin. I will put down his words literally:</p>
<p>“I am told that objections have been raised against me because, forsooth, at the request
of some of my brethren, I translated certain works of Origen from Greek into Latin. I suppose
that every one sees that it is only through ill-will that this is made a matter of blame. For, if
there is any offensive statement in the author, why is this to be twisted into a fault of the
translator? I was asked to exhibit in Latin what stands written in the Greek text; and I did
nothing more than fit Latin words to Greek ideas. If, therefore, there is anything to praise
in these ideas, the praise does not belong to me: and similarly as to anything to which blame
may attach.”</p>
<p>“I hear,” he says, “that thence dispute has arisen.”3111 How clever this is, to speak of it
as a dispute, when it is really an accusation against him. “That I have, at the request of my
brethren, translated certain things of Origen’s into Latin.” Yes, but what are these “certain
things”? Have they no name? Are you silent? Then the bills of charge brought by the accusers
will speak for you. “I suppose,” he says, “that every one understands that it is only through
envy that these things are made matters of blame.” What envy? Are people envious of your
eloquence? Or have you done what no other man has ever been able to do? Here am I, who
have translated many works of Origen’s; yet, except you, no one shews envy towards me or
calumniates me for it. “If there is any offensive statement in the author, why is it to be
twisted into a fault of the translator? I was asked to exhibit in Latin what stands written in
the Greek text; and I did nothing more than fit Latin words to Greek ideas. If, therefore,
there is anything to praise in these ideas, the praise does not belong to me, and similarly as
to anything to which blame may attach.” Can you be astonished that men think ill of you
when you say of open blasphemies nothing more than, “If there are any offensive statements
in the author”? What is said in those books is offensive to all men; and you stand alone in
your doubt and in your complaint that this is “twisted into a fault of the translator,” when
you have praised it in your Preface. ‘You were asked to turn it into Latin as it stood in the
Greek text.’ I wish you had done what you pretend you were asked. You would not then be
the object of any ill will. If you had kept faith as a translator, it would not have been necessary
for me to counteract your false translation by my true one. You know in your own conscience
what you added, what you subtracted, and what you altered on one side or the other at your
discretion; and after this you have the audacity to tell us that what is good or evil is not to
be attributed to you but to the author. You shew your sense of the ill will aroused against
you by again toning down your words: and as if you were walking with your steps in the air
or on the tops of the ears of corn, you say, “Whether there is praise or blame in these opin-
<note type="footnote">3111 As above, the word for word rendering is given.</note>

<pb n="1302"/>
ions.” You dare not defend him, but you do not choose to condemn him. Choose which of
the two you please; the option is yours; if this which you have translated is good, praise it,
if bad, condemn it. But he makes excuses, and weaves another artifice, He says:</p>
<p>“I admit that I put something of my own into the work: as I stated in my Preface, I used
my own discretion in cutting out not a few passages; but only those as to which I had come
to suspect that the thing had not been so stated by Origen himself, and the statement appeared
to me in these cases to have been inserted by others, because in other places I had found the
author state the same matter in a catholic sense.”3112</p>
<p>What wonderful eloquence! Varied, too, with flowers of the Attic style. “Moreover
also!”3113 and “Things which came to me into suspicion!” I marvel that he should have
dared to send such literary portents to Rome. One would think that the man’s tongue was
in fetters, and bound with cords that cannot be disentangled, so that it could hardly break
forth into human speech. However, I will return to the matter in hand.</p>
<p>11 (a). I wish to know who gave you permission to cut out a number of passages from
the work you were translating? You were asked to turn a Greek book into Latin, not to
correct it; to draw out another man’s words, not to write a book of your own. You confess,
by the fact of pruning away so much, that you did not do what you were asked. And I wish
that what you curtailed had all been the bad parts, and that you had not put in many things
of your own which go to support what is bad. I will take an example, from which men may
judge of the rest. In the first book of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν where Origen had uttered that impious
blasphemy, that the Son does not see the Father, you supply the reasons for this, as if in the
name of the writer, and translate the note of Didymus, in which he makes a fruitless effort
to defend another man’s error, trying to prove that Origen spoke rightly; but we, poor simple
men, like the tame creatures spoken of by Ennius, can understand neither his wisdom nor
that of his translator. Your Preface, which you allege in explanation, in which you flatter
and praise me so highly shows you to be guilty of the most serious faults of translation. You
say that you have cut out many things from the Greek, but you say nothing of what you
have put in. Were the parts cut out good or bad? Bad, I suppose. Was what you kept good
or bad? Good, I presume; for you could not translate the bad. Then I suppose you cut off
what was bad and left what was good? Of course. But what you have translated can be shewn
to be almost wholly bad. Whatever therefore in your translation I can shew to be bad, must
be laid to your account, since you translated it as being good. It is a strange thing if you are
to act like an unjust censor, who is himself guilty of the crime, and are allowed at your will
to expel some from the Senate and keep others in it. But you say: “It was impossible to
<note type="footnote">3112 See Rufinus’ position vindicated in his treatise on the corruption of Origen’s writings, translated in this
volume.</note>
<note type="footnote">3113 Quin immo etiam, the first words of the literally, “Yes, moreover also.”</note>

<pb n="1303"/>
change everything. I only thought I might cut away what had been added by the heretics.”
Very good. Then if you cut away all that you thought had been added by the heretics, all
that you left belongs to the work which you were translating. Answer me then, are these
good or bad? You could not translate what was bad, since once for all you had cut away
what had been added by the heretics, that is, unless you thought it your duty to cut away
the bad parts due to the heretics, while translating the errors of Origen himself unaltered
into Latin. Tell me then, why you turned Origen’s heresies into Latin. Was it to expose the
author of the evil, or to praise him? If your object is to expose him, why do you praise him
in the Preface? If you praise him you are convicted of being a heretic. The only remaining
hypothesis is that you published these things as being good. But if they are proved to be bad,
then author and translator are involved in the same crime, and the Psalmist’s word is fulfilled:
3114 “When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.” It is needless to make a plain matter doubtful by arguing about it. As
to what follows, let him answer whence this suspicion arose in his mind of these additions
by heretics. “It was,” he says, “because I found the same things treated by this author in
other places in a catholic sense.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3114 Ps. l. 18</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">     
<pb n="1304"/>
<p>12. We must consider the fact, which comes first, and so in order reach the inference,
which comes after. Now I find among many bad things written by Origen the following
most distinctly heretical: that the Son of God is a creature, that the Holy Spirit is a servant:
that there are innumerable worlds, succeeding one another in eternal ages: that angels have
been turned into human souls; that the soul of the Saviour existed before it was born of
Mary, and that it is this soul which “being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be
equal with God, but emptied itself and took the form of a servant;”3115 that the resurrection
of our bodies will be such that we shall not have the same members, since, when the functions
of the members cease they will become superfluous: and that our bodies themselves will
grow aërial and spirit-like, and gradually vanish and disperse into thin air and into nothing:
that in the restitution of all things, when the fulness of forgiveness will have been reached,
Cherubim and Seraphim, Thrones, Principalities, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, Archangels
and Angels, the devil, the demons and the souls of men whether Christians Jews or Heathen,
will be of one condition and degree; and when they have come to their true form and weight,
and the new army of the whole race returning from the exile of the world presents a mass
of rational creatures with all their dregs left behind, then will begin a new world from a new
origin, and other bodies in which the souls who fall from heaven will be clothed; so that we
may have to fear that we who are now men may afterwards be born women, and one who
is now a virgin may chance then to be a prostitute. These things I point out as heresies in
the books of Origen. It is for you to point out in which of his books you have found them
contradicted.</p>
<note type="footnote">3115 Phil. ii</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">     
<pb n="1305"/>
<p>13. Do not tell me that “you have found the same things treated by the same author in
other places in a catholic sense,” and thus send me to search through the six thousand books
of Origen which you charge the most reverend Bishop Epiphanius with having read; but
mention the passages with exactness: nor will this suffice; you must produce the sentences
word for word. Origen is no fool, as I well know; he cannot contradict himself. The net
result arising from all this calculation is, then, that what you cut out was not due to the
heretics, but to Origen himself, and that you translated the bad things he had written because
you considered them good; and that both the good and the bad things in the book are to be
set to your account, since you approved his writings in the Prologue.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">     
<pb n="1306"/>
<p>14. The next passage in this apology is as follows:</p>
<p>“I am neither a champion nor a defender of Origen, nor am I the first who has translated
his works. Others before me have done the same thing: and I did it, the last of many, at the
request of my brethren. If an order is to be given that such translations are not to be made,
such an order holds good for the future, not the past: but if those are to be blamed who have
made these translations before any such order was given, the blame must begin with those
who took the first step.”</p>
<p>Here at last he has vomited forth what he wanted to say, and all his inflamed mind has
broken out into this malicious accusation against me. When he translates the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν
he declares that he is following me. When he is accused for having done it, he gives me as
his example: whether he is in danger or out of danger, he cannot live without me. Let me
tell him, therefore, what he professes not to know. No one reproaches you because you
translated Origen, otherwise Hilary and Ambrose would be condemned: but because you
translated a heretical work, and tried to gain support for it by praising me in the Preface. I
myself, whom you criminate, translated seventy homilies of Origen, and parts of his Tomes,
in order that by translating his best works I might withdraw the worst from notice: and I
also have openly translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν to prove the falsity of your translation, so as to
show the reader what to avoid. If you wish to translate Origen into Latin, you have at hand
many homilies and Tomes of his, in which some topic of morality is handled or some obscure
passage of Scripture is opened. Translate these; give these to those who ask them of you.
Why should your first labour begin with what is infamous? And why, when you were about
to translate a heretical work, did you preface and support it by the supposed book of a
martyr, and force upon the ears of Romans a book the translation of which threw the world
into panic? At all events, if you translate such a work with the view of exhibiting the author
as a heretic, change nothing from the Greek text, and make this clear in the Preface. It is
this which the Pope Anastasius most wisely embodies in the letter which he has addressed
to the Bishop John against you; he frees me who have done this from all blame, but condemns
you who would not do it. You will perhaps deny the existence of this letter; I have therefore
subjoined a copy of it; so that, if you will not listen to your brother when he advises, you
may listen to the Bishop when he condemns.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">     
<pb n="1307"/>
<p>15. You say that you are not the defender or the champion of Origen; but I will at once
confront you with your own book of which you spoke in that notorious preface to your
renowned work in these terms:</p>
<p>“The cause of this diversity I have set forth more fully for you in the Apology which
Pamphilus wrote among his treatises, adding a very short document of my own, in which
I have shewn by what appear to me evident proofs, that his works have been depraved in
many places by heretics and ill-disposed persons, and especially those which I am now
translating, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν.”</p>
<p>The defence made by Eusebius, or if you will have it so, by Pamphilus, was not sufficient
for you, but you must add something from your superior wisdom and learning to supply
what you thought insufficient in what they had said. It would be a long business if I were
to insert the whole of your book into the present treatise, and, after setting out each paragraph,
to reply to each in turn, and shew what vices there are in the style, what falsehoods
in the assertions, what inconsistency in the actual tissue of the language. And therefore, to
avoid a redundant discussion which is distasteful to me, I will compress the verbal matter
into a narrow compass, and reply to the meaning alone. As soon as he leaves the harbour
he runs his ship upon a rock. He recalls the words of the Apology of the Martyr Pamphilus
(which however, I have proved to be the work of Eusebius the Chief of the Arians) of which
he had said, “I translated it into the Latin tongue as best I was able and as the matter demanded;”
he then adds: “It is this as to which I wish to give you a charge, Macarius, man of desires,
3116 that you may feel sure that this rule of faith which I have above set forth out of his
books, is such as ought to be embraced and held fast: it is clearly shewn that there is a catholic
meaning in them all.” Although he took away many things from the book of Eusebius,
and tried to alter in a good sense the expressions about the Son and the Holy Spirit, still
there are found in it many causes of offence, and even open blasphemies, which our friend
cannot refuse to accept since he pronounces them to be catholic. Eusebius (or, if you please,
Pamphilus) says in that book that the Son is the Servant of the Father, the Holy Spirit is not
of the same substance with the Father and the Son; that the souls of men have fallen from
heaven; and, inasmuch as we have been changed from the state of Angels, that in the restitution
of all things angels and devils and men will all be equal; and many other things so
impious and atrocious that it would be a crime even to repeat them. The champion of Origen
and translator of Pamphilus is in a strange position. If there is so much blasphemy in these
parts which he has corrected, what sacrilegious things must there be in the parts which, as
he pretends, have been falsified by heretics! What makes him hold this opinion, as he says,
is that a man who is neither a fool nor a madman could not have said things mutually repug-
<note type="footnote">3116 Taken from Daniel x. 11, “Thou man greatly beloved” (“a man of desires”).</note>

<pb n="1308"/>
nant; and, that we may not suppose that he had written different things at different times,
and that he put forth contrary views according to the time of writing, he has added:</p>
<p>“What are we to say when sometimes in the same place, and, so to speak, almost in the
following paragraph, a sentence with an opposite meaning is found inserted? Can we believe
that, in the same work and in the same book, and sometimes, as I have said in the sentence
immediately following, he can have forgotten his own words? For example, could he who
had before said, we can find no passage throughout the Scriptures in which the Holy Spirit
is said to be created or made, immediately add that the Holy Spirit was made among the
rest of the creatures? or again, could he who defined the Father and the Son to be of one
substance, that namely which is called in Greek Homoousion, say in the following portions
that he was of another substance, and that he was created, when but a little before he had
declared him to be born from the nature of God the Father?”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">     
<pb n="1309"/>
<p>16. These are his own words, he cannot deny them. Now I do not want to be put off
with such expressions as “since he said above” but I want to have the name of the book in
which he first spoke rightly and then wrongly: in which he first says that the Holy Spirit and
the Son are of the substance of God, and in what immediately follows declares that they are
creatures. Do you not know that I possess the whole of Origen’s works and have read a vast
number of them?
<lg>
<l>“Your trappings to the mob! I know you well;</l>
<l>What lies within and on the skin I see.”3117</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Eusebius who was a very learned man, (observe I say learned not catholic: you must
not, according to your wont make this a ground for calumniating me) takes up six volumes
with nothing else but the attempt to shew that Origen is of his way of believing, that is of
the Arian perfidy. He brings out many test-passages, and effectually proves his point. In
what dream in an Alexandrian prison was the revelation given to you on the strength of
which you make out these passages to be falsified which he accepts as true? But possibly he
being an Arian, took in these additions of the heretics to support his own error, so that he
should not be thought to be the only one who had held false opinions contrary to the Church.
What answer will you make, then, as to Didymus, who certainly is catholic as regards the
Trinity? You know that I translated his book on the Holy Spirit into Latin. He surely could
not have assented to the passages in Origen’s works which were added by heretics; yet he
wrote some short commentaries on the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν which you have translated; in these he
never denies that what is there written was written by Origen, but only tries to persuade us
simple people that we do not understand his meaning and how these passages ought to be
taken in a good sense. So much on the Son and the Holy Spirit alone. But in reference to
the rest of Origen’s doctrines, both Eusebius and Didymus adhere to his views, and defend,
as said in a catholic and Christian sense, what all the churches reprobate.</p>
<note type="footnote">3117 Persius, iii, 30.</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">     
<pb n="1310"/>
<p>17. But let us consider what are the arguments by which he tries to prove that Origen’s
writings have been corrupted by the heretics.</p>
<p>“Clement,” he says, “who was the disciple of the Apostles, and who succeeded the apostles
both in the episcopate and in martyrdom, wrote the books which go by the name of Anagnorismus,
that is, Recognitions. In these, though, speaking generally, the doctrine which
is set forth in the name of the Apostle Peter is genuinely apostolical, yet in certain passages
the doctrine of Eunomius is brought in such a way as that you would suppose Eunomius
himself to be conducting the argument and asserting his view that the Son was created out
of nothing.”</p>
<p>And, after a passage too long to reproduce, he adds:</p>
<p>“What then are we to think of these facts? Must we believe that an Apostolic man wrote
heresy? or is it not more likely that men of perverse mind, wishing to gain support for their
own doctrines, and win easier credit for them, introduced under the names of holy men
views which they cannot be believed either to have held or to have written down?”</p>
<p>He tells us that Clement the presbyter of Alexandria also, who was a catholic man, writes
at times in his works that the Son of God is created; and that Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria,
a most learned man, in the four books in which he controverted the doctrines of Sabellius,
lapses into the dogma of Arius. What he aims at by quoting these instances is not to shew
that Churchmen and catholics have erred, but that their writings have been corrupted by
heretics, and he closes the discussion with these words:</p>
<p>“And when we find in Origen a certain diversity of doctrine, just as we have found it in
those of whom we have spoken above, will it not be sufficient for us to believe the same in
his case which we believe or understand in the case of the catholic men whom we have
passed in review? Will not the same defence hold good when the case is the same?”</p>
<p>If, I reply, we admit that everything in a book which is offensive is corruptly inserted
by others, nothing will remain belonging to the author under whose name the book passes,
but everything can be assigned to those by whom it is supposed to have been corrupted. But
then it will not belong to them either, since we do not know who they were: and the result
will be that every book belongs to everybody and nothing to any one in particular. In this
confusion which this method of defence introduces, it will be impossible to convict Marcion
of error, or Manichæus or Arius or Eunomius; because, as soon as we point out a statement
of their unbelief, their disciples will answer that was not what the master wrote, but was
corruptly inserted by his opponents. According to this principle, this very book of yours
will not be yours nor mine. And as to this very book in which I am making reply to your
accusations, whatever you find fault with in it will be held not be written by me but by you

<pb n="1311"/>
who now find fault with it. And further, while you assign everything to the heretics, there
will be nothing left which you can assign to churchmen as their own.</p>
<p>But you may ask, How is it then that in their books some false views occur? Well, if I
answer that I do not know the parties whence these false views came, I must not be thought
to have said that they are heretics. It is possible that they may have fallen into error unawares,
or that the words bore a different meaning, or that they may have been gradually corrupted
by unskilful copyists. It must be admitted that, before Arius arose in Alexandria as a demon
of the south, things were said incautiously which cannot be defended against a malevolent
criticism. But when glaring faults are exposed in Origen, you do not defend him but accuse
others; you do not deny the faults, but summon up a host of criminals. If you were asked
to name those who have been the companions of Origen in his heresies, it would be right
enough to call in these others. But what you are now asked to tell us is whether those statements
in the books of Origen are good or evil; and you say nothing, but bring in irrelevant
matters, such as: This is what Clement says; this is an error of which Dionysius is found
guilty; these are the words in which the bishop Athanasius defends the error of Dionysius;
in a similar way the writings of the Apostle have been tampered with: and then, while the
charge of heresy is fastened upon you, you say nothing in your own defence, but make
confessions about me. I make no accusations, and am content with answering for myself. I
am not what you try to prove me: whether you are what you are accused of being, is for you
to consider. The fact that I am acquitted of blame does not prove me innocent nor the fact
that you are accused prove you a criminal.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">     
<pb n="1312"/>
<p>18. After this preface as to the falsification by heretics of the apostles, of both the Clements,
and of Dionysius, he at last comes to Origen; and these are his words:</p>
<p>“I have shewn from his own words and writings how he himself complains of this and
deplores it: He explains clearly in the letter which he wrote to some of his intimate friends
at Alexandria what he suffered while living here in the flesh and in the full enjoyment of his
senses, by the corruption of his books and treatises, or by spurious editions of them.”</p>
<p>He subjoins a copy of this letter; and he who implores to the heretics the falsification
of Origen’s writings himself begins by falsifying them, for he does not translate the letter as
he finds it in the Greek, and does not convey to the Latins what Origen states in his letter.
The object of the whole letter is to assail Demetrius the Pontiff of Alexandria, and to inveigh
against the bishops throughout the world, and to tell them that their excommunication of
him is invalid; he says further that he has no intention of retorting their evil speaking; indeed
he is so much afraid of evil speaking that he does not dare to speak evil even of the devil;
insomuch that he gave occasion to Candidus an adherent of the errors of Valentinian to
represent him falsely as saying that the devil is of such a nature as could be saved. But our
friend takes no notice of the real purport of the letter, and makes up for Origen an argument
which he does not use. I have therefore translated a part of the letter, beginning a little way
below what has been already spoken of, and have appended it to the part which has been
translated by him in a curtailed and disingenuous manner, so that the reader may perceive
the object with which he suppressed the earlier part. He is contending, then, against the
Bishops of the church generally, because they had judged him unworthy of its communion;
and he continues as follows:</p>
<p>“Why need I speak of the language in which the prophets constantly threaten and reprove
the pastors, elders, the priests and the princes? These things you can of yourselves without
my aid draw out from the Holy Scriptures, and you may clearly see that it may well be the
present time of which it is said3118 ‘Trust not in your friends, and do not hope in princes,’
and that the prophecy is now gaining its fulfilment,3119 ‘The leaders of my people have not
known me; my sons are fools and not wise: they are wise to do evil, but know not to do
good.’ We ought to pity them, not to hate them, to pray for them, not to curse them. For
we have been created for blessing, not for cursing. Therefore even Michael,3120 when he
disputed against the devil concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a railing accusation
even for so great an evil, but said; ‘The Lord rebuke thee.’ And we read something

salem rebuke thee.’ So also we desire that those who will not humbly accept the rebuke of
their neighbours may be rebuked of the Lord. But, since Michael says, ‘The Lord rebuke
thee, O Satan,’ and Zechariah says the same, the devil knows well whether the Lord rebukes
him or not; and must acknowledge the manner of the rebuke.”</p>
<p>Then, after a passage too long to insert here, he adds:</p>
<p>“We believe that not only those who have committed great sins will be cast out from
the kingdom of heaven, such as fornicators and adulterers, and those who defile themselves
with mankind, and thieves, but those also who have done evil of a less flagrant kind, since
it is written;3122 ‘Neither drunkards nor evil speakers shall inherit the kingdom of God;’
and that the standard by which men will be judged is as much the goodness as the severity
of God. Therefore we strive to act thoughtfully in all things, in drinking wine, and in moderation
of language, so that we dare not speak evil of any man. Now, because, through the
fear of God, we are careful not to utter maledictions against any one, remembering that the
words ‘He dared not bring against him a railing accusation,’ are spoken of Michael in his
dealing with the devil; as it is said also in another place,3123 ‘They set at naught dominions
and rail at dignities;’ certain of these men who seek for matters of contention, ascribe to us
and our teaching the blasphemy (as to which they have to lay to heart the words which apply
to them, ‘Neither drunkards nor evil speakers shall inherit the kingdom of God’), namely,
that the father of wickedness and perdition of those who shall be cast out of the kingdom
of God can be saved; a thing which not even a madman can say.”</p>
<p>The rest which comes in the same letter he has3124 set down instead of the later words
of Origen which I have translated: “Now, because through the fear of God we are careful
not to utter maledictions against any one,” and so on; he fraudulently cuts off the earlier
part, on which the later depends, and begins to translate the letter, as though the former
part began with this statement, and says:</p>
<p>“Some of those who delight in bringing complaints against their neighbours, ascribe to
us and our teaching the crime of a blasphemy, which we have never spoken, (as to which
they must consider whether they are willing to stand by the decree which says ‘The evil
speakers shall not inherit the kingdom of God,’) for they say that I assert that the father of
the wickedness and perdition of those who shall be cast out of the kingdom of God, that is,
the devil, will be saved; a thing which no man even though he had taken leave of his senses
and was manifestly insane could say.”</p>

<p>19. Now compare the words of Origen, which I have translated word for word above,
with these which by him have been turned into Latin, or rather overturned; and you will
see clearly how great a discrepancy between them there is, not only of word but of meaning.
I beg you not to consider my translation wearisome because it is longer; for the object I had
in translating the whole passage was to exhibit the purpose which he had in suppressing the
earlier part. There exists in Greek a dialogue between Origen and Candidus the defender
of the heresy of Valentinian, in which I confess it seems to me when I read it that I am
looking on at a fight between two Andabatian gladiators. Candidus maintains that the Son
is of the substance of the Father, falling into the error of asserting a Probolé or Production.
3125 On the other side, Origen, like Arius and Eunomius, refuses to admit that He is
produced or born, lest God the Father should thus be divided into parts; but he says that
He was a sublime and most excellent creation who came into being by the will of the Father
like other creatures. They then come to a second question. Candidus asserts that the devil
is of a nature wholly evil which can never be saved. Against this Origen rightly asserts that
he is not of perishable substance, but that it is by his own will that he fell and can be saved.
This Candidus falsely turns into a reproach against Origen, as if he had said that the
diabolical nature could be saved. What therefore Candidus had falsely accused him of,
Origen refutes. But we see that in this Dialogue alone Origen accuses the heretics of having
falsified his writings, not in the other books about which no question was ever raised. Otherwise,
if we are to believe that all which is heretical is not due to Origen but to the heretics,
while almost all his books are full of these errors, nothing of Origen’s will remain, but
everything must be the work of those of whose names we are ignorant.</p>
<p>It is not enough for him to calumniate the Greeks and the men of old time, about whom
the distance either of time or space gives him the power to tell any falsehood he pleases. He
comes to the Latins, and first takes the case of Hilary the Confessor, whose book, he states,
was falsified by the heretics after the Council of Ariminum. A question arose about him on
this account in a council of bishops, and he then ordered the book to be brought from his
own house. The book in its heretical shape was in his desk, though he did not know it; and
when it was produced, the author of the book was condemned as a heretic and excommunicated,
and left the council room. This is the story, a mere dream of his own, which he tells
to his intimates; and he imagines his authority to be so great that no one will dare to contradict
him when he says such things. I will ask him a few questions. In what city was the synod
held by which Hilary was excommunicated? What were the names of the Bishops present?
Who subscribed the sentence? Who were content, and who non-content? Who were the
<note type="footnote">3125 A bringing forth of one thing from another, that is, according to Valentinian, of Christ as a production
from another Æon.</note>

<pb n="1315"/>
consuls of the year? and who was the emperor who ordered the assembly of the council?
Were the Bishops present those of Gaul alone, or of Italy and Spain as well? and for what
purpose was the council called together? You tell us none of these things; yet, in order to
defend Origen, you treat as a criminal and as excommunicated a man of the highest eloquence,
the very clarion of the Latin tongue against the Arians. But we are in the presence
of a confessor, and even his calumnies must be borne with patience. He next passes to
Cyprian the illustrious martyr, and he tells us that a book by Tertullian entitled “On the
Trinity” is read as one of his works by the partisans of the Macedonian heresy at Constantinople.
In this charge of his he tells two falsehoods. The book in question is not Tertullian’s,
nor does it pass under the name of Cyprian. It is by Novatian and is called by his
name; the peculiarity of the style proves the authorship of the work.</p>

<p>20. What nonsense is this out of which they fabricate a charge against me! It seems
hardly worth while to notice it. It is a story of my own about the council held by Damasus
Bishop of Rome, and I, under the name of a certain friend of his, am attacked for it. He had
given me some papers about church affairs to get copied; and the story describes a trick
practised by the Apollinarians who borrowed one of these, a book of Athanasius’ to read in
which occur the words3126 ‘Dominicus homo,’ and falsified it by first scratching out the
words, and then writing them in again on the erasure, so that it might appear, not that the
book had been falsified by them, but that the words had been added by me. I beg you, my
dearest friend, that in these matters of serious interest to the church, where doctrinal truth
is in question, and we are seeking for the authority of our predecessors for the well-being
of our souls to put away silly stuff of this kind, and not take mere after-dinner stories as if
they were arguments. For it is quite possible that, even after you have heard the true story
from me, another who does not know it may declare that it is made up, and composed in
elegant language by you like a mine of Philistion or a song of Lentulus or Marcellus.</p>

<p>21. To what point will not rashness reach when once the reins which check it are relaxed?
After telling us of the excommunication of Hilary, the heretical book falsely bearing the
name of Cyprian, the successive erasure and insertion in the work of Athanasius made while
I was asleep, he as a last effort breaks forth into an attack upon the pope Epiphanius: the
chagrin engendered in his heart because Epiphanius in the letter which he wrote to the
bishop John had called him a heretic, he pours out in his apology for Origen, and comforts
himself with these words:</p>
<p>“The whole truth, which has been hidden, must here be laid bare. It is impossible that
any man should exercise so unrighteous a judgment as to judge unequally where the cases
are equal. But the fact is, the prompters of those who defame Origen are men who either
make it a habit to discourse in the churches at great length or write books, the whole of
which, both books and discourse are taken from Origen. To prevent men therefore from
discovering their plagiarism, the crime of which can be concealed so long as they act ungratefully
towards their master, they deter all simple persons from reading him. One of them,
who considers himself to have a necessity laid upon him to speak evil of Origen through
every nation and tongue, as if that were to preach the Gospel, once declared in the audience
of a vast multitude of the brethren that he had read six thousand of his books. If he read
them, as he is wont to declare, in order to know what harm there was in him, ten or twenty
books, or at most thirty, would have been sufficient for that knowledge. To read six thousand
books is not like one who wants to know the harm and the errors that are in him, but like
one who consecrates almost his whole life to studies conducted under his tuition. How then
can he claim to be listened to when he blames those who, for the sake of instruction, have
read a small portion of his works, taking care to maintain whole their own system of belief
and their piety?”</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">     
<pb n="1318"/>
<p>22. Who are these men who are wont to dispute at such great length in the churches,
and to write books, and whose discourses and writings are taken wholly from Origen; these
men who are afraid of their literary thefts becoming known, and shew ingratitude towards
their master, and who therefore deter men of simple mind from reading him? You ought
to mention them by name, and designate the men themselves. Are the reverend bishops3127
Anastasius and Theophilus, Venerius and Chromatius, and the whole council of the Catholics
both in the East and in the West, who publicly denounce him as a heretic, to be esteemed
to be plagiarists of his books? Are we to believe that, when they preach in the churches, they
do not preach the mysteries of the Scriptures, but merely repeat what they have stolen from
Origen? Is it not enough for you to disparage them all in general, but you must specially
aim the spear of your pen against a reverend and eminent Bishop of the church? Who is
this who considers that he has a necessity laid on him of reviling Origen, as the Gospel which
he must preach among all nations and tongues? this man who proclaimed in the audience
of a vast multitude of the brethren that he had read six thousand of his books? You yourself
were in the very centre of that multitude and company of the brethren, when, as he complains
in his letter,3128 the monstrous doctrines of Origen were enlarged upon by you. Is it to be
imputed to him as a crime that he knows the Greek, the Syrian, the Hebrew, the Egyptian,
and in part also the Latin language? Then, I suppose, the Apostles and Apostolic men, who
spoke with tongues, are to be condemned; and you who know two languages may deride
me who know three. But as for the six thousand books which you pretend that he has read,
who will believe that you are speaking the truth, or that he was capable of telling such a lie?
If indeed Origen had written six thousand books, it is possible that a man of great learning,
who had been trained from his infancy in sacred literature might have read books alien from
his own convictions, because he had an inquiring spirit and a love of learning. But how
could be read what Origen never wrote? Count up the index contained in the third volume
of Eusebius, in which is his life of Pamphilus: you will not find, I do not say six thousand,
but not a third of that number of books. I have by me the letter of the above named Pontiff,
in which he gives his answer to this calumny of yours uttered when you were still in the
East; and it confutes this most manifest falsehood with the open countenance of truth.</p>

<p>23. After all this you dare to say in your Apology, that you are not the defender nor the
champion of Origen, though you think that Eusebius and Pamphilus said all too little in his
defence. I shall try to write a reply to those works in another treatise if God grants me a
sufficient span of life. For the present let it suffice that I have met your assertions, and that
I have set the careful reader on his guard by stating that I never saw in writing the book
which was known as the work of Pamphilus till I read it in your own manuscript. It was no
great concern of mine to know what was written in favour of a heretic, and therefore I always
took it that the work of Pamphilus was different from that of Eusebius; but, after the question
had been raised, I wished to reply to their works, and with this object I read what each of
them had to say in Origen’s behalf; and then I discerned clearly that the first of Eusebius’
six books was the same which you had published both in Greek and Latin as the single book
of Pamphilus, only altering the opinion about the Son and the Holy Spirit, which bore on
their face the mark of open blasphemy. It was thus that, when my friend, Dexter, who held
the office of prætorian prefect, asked me, ten years ago, to make a list for him of the writers
of our faith,3129 placed among the various treatises assigned to various authors this book
as composed by Pamphilus, supposing the matter to be as it had been brought before the
public by you and by your disciples. But, since Eusebius himself says that Pamphilus wrote
nothing except some short letters to his friends, and the first of his six books contains the
precise words which are fictitiously given by you under the name of Pamphilus, it is plain
that your object in circulating this book was to introduce heresy under the authority of a
martyr. I cannot allow you to make my mistake a cloak for your fraud, when you first pretend
that the book is by Pamphilus and then pervert many of its passages so as to make them
different in Latin from what they are in Greek. I believed the book to be by the writer whose
name it bore, just as I did in reference to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, and many other of the works of
Origen and of other Greek writers, which I never read till now, and am now compelled to
read, because the question of heresy has been raised, and I wish to know what ought to be
avoided and what opposed. In my youth, therefore, I translated only the homilies which he
delivered in public, and in which there are fewer causes of offence; and this in ignorance
and at the request of others: I did not try to prejudice men by means of the parts which they
approved in favour of the acceptance of those which are evidently heretical. At all events,
to cut short a long discussion, I can point out whence I received the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, namely,
from those who copied it from your manuscript. We want in like manner to know whence
your copy of it came; for if you are unable to name any one else as the source from which
it was derived, you will yourself be convicted of falsifying it.3130 “A good man from the good

<p>24. My brother Eusebius writes to me that, when he was at a meeting of African bishops
which had been called for certain ecclesiastical affairs, he found there a letter purporting to
be written by me, in which I professed penitence and confessed that it was through the influence
of the press in my youth that I had been led to turn the Scriptures into Latin from
the Hebrew; in all of which there is not a word of truth. When I heard this, I was stupefied.
But one witness was not enough; even Cato was not believed on his unsupported evidence:3131
“In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.” Letters were soon
brought me from many brethren in Rome asking about this very matter, whether the facts
were as was stated: and they pointed in a way to make me weep to the person by whom the
letter had been circulated among the people. He who dared to do this, what will he not dare
to do? It is well that ill will has not a strength equal to its intentions. Innocence would be
dead long ago if wickedness were always allied to power, and calumny could prevail in all
that it seeks to accomplish. It was impossible for him, accomplished as he was, to copy any
style and manner of writing, whatever their value may be; amidst all his tricks and his
fraudulent assumption of another man’s personality, it was evident who he was. It is this
same man, then, who wrote this fictitious letter of retractation in my name, making out that
my translation of the Hebrew books was bad, who, we now hear, accuses me of having
translated the Holy Scriptures with a view to disparage the Septuagint. In any case, whether
my translation is right or wrong, I am to be condemned: I must either confess that in my
new work I was wrong, or else that by my new version I have aimed a blow at the old. I
wonder that in this letter he did not make me out as guilty of homicide, or adultery or sacrilege
or parricide or any of the vile things which the silent working of the mind can revolve
within itself. Indeed I ought to be grateful to him for having imputed to me no more than
one act of error or false dealing out of the whole forest of possible crimes. Am I likely to
have said anything derogatory to the seventy translators, whose work I carefully purged
from corruptions and gave to Latin readers many years ago, and daily expound it at our
conventual gatherings;3132 whose version of the Psalms has so long been the subject of my
meditation and my song? Was I so foolish as to wish to forget in old age what I learned in
youth? All my treatises have been woven out of statements warranted by their version. My
commentaries on the twelve prophets are an explanation of their version as well as my own.
How uncertain must the labours of men ever be! and how contrary at times to their own
intentions are the results which men’s studies reach. I thought that I deserved well of my
countrymen the Latins by this version, and had given them an incitement to learning; for
it is not despised even by the Greeks now that it is retranslated into their language; yet it is

now made the subject of a charge against me; and I find that the food pressed upon them
turns upon the stomach. What is there in human life that can be safe if innocence is made
the object of accusation? I am the householder3133 who finds that while he slept the enemy
has sown tares among his wheat.3134 “The wild boar out of the wood has rooted up my
vineyard, and the strange wild beast has devoured it.” I keep silence, but a letter that is not
mine speaks against me. I am ignorant of the crime laid against me, yet I am made to confess
the crime all through the world.3135 “Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man

<p>25. All my prefaces to the books of the Old Testament, some specimens of which I
subjoin, are witnesses for me on this point; and it is needless to state the matter otherwise
than it is stated in them. I will begin therefore with Genesis. The Prologue is as follows:</p>
<p>I have received letters so long and eagerly desired from my dear Desiderius3137 who, as
if the future had been foreseen, shares his name with Daniel,3138 entreating me to put our
friends in possession of a translation of the Pentateuch from Hebrew into Latin. The work
is certainly hazardous and it is exposed to the3139 attacks of my calumniators, who maintain
that it is through contempt of the Seventy that I have set to work to forge a new version to
take the place of the old. They thus test ability as they do wine; whereas I have again and
again declared that I dutifully offer, in the Tabernacle of God what I can, and have pointed
out that the great gifts which one man brings are not marred by the inferior gifts of another.
But I was stimulated to undertake the task by the zeal of Origen, who blended with the old
edition Theodotion’s translation and used throughout the work as distinguishing marks the
asterisk * and the obelus †, that is the star and the spit, the first of which makes what had
previously been defective to beam with light, while the other transfixes and slaughters all
that was superfluous. But I was encouraged above all by the authoritative publications of
the Evangelists and Apostles, in which we read much taken from the Old Testament which
is not found in our manuscripts. For example, ‘Out of Egypt have I called my Son’ (Matt.
ii. 15): ‘For he shall be called a Nazarene’ (Ibid. 23): and ‘They shall look on him whom they
pierced’ (John xix. 37): and ‘Rivers of living water shall flow out of his belly’ (John vii. 38):
and ‘Things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man,
which God hath prepared for them that love him’ (1 Cor. ii. 9), and many other passages
which lack their proper context. Let us ask our opponents then where these things are
written, and when they are unable to tell, let us produce them from the Hebrew. The first
passage is in Hosea, (xi. 1), the second in Isaiah (xi. 1), the third in Zechariah (xii. 10), the
fourth in Proverbs (xviii. 4), the fifth also in Isaiah (lxiv. 4). Being ignorant of all this many
follow the ravings of the Apocrypha, and prefer to the inspired books the melancholy trash
which comes to us from Spain.3140 It is not for me to explain the causes of the error. The

in Spain, and especially in Lusitania, have been deceived into accepting as truth the marvels of Basilides and
Balsaneus’ treasury, and even of Barbelo and Leusiboras.” Jerome goes on to add that Irenæus in explaining the
origin of many heresies pointed out that the Gnostics deceived many noble women of the parts of Gaul about
the Rhone, and afterwards those of Spain, framing a system partly of myths partly of immorality, and calling
their folly by the name of philosophy. See also, Ep. Jer. Letter 120 to Hedibia, and Com. on Amos cf. III.</note>

Jews say it was deliberately and wisely done to prevent3141 Ptolemy who was a monotheist
from thinking the Hebrews acknowledged two deities. And that which chiefly influenced
them in thus acting was the fact that the king appeared to be falling into Platonism. In a
word, wherever Scripture evidenced some sacred truth respecting Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, they either translated the passage differently, or passed it over altogether in silence,
so that they might both satisfy the king, and not divulge the secrets of the faith. I do not
know whose false imagination led him to invent the story of the3142 seventy cells at Alexandria,
in which, though separated from each other, the translators were said to have written
the same words. Aristeas,3143 the champion of that same Ptolemy, and Josephus, long after,
relate nothing of the kind; their account is that the Seventy assembled in one basilica consulted
together, and did not prophesy. For it is one thing to be a prophet, another to be a
translator. The former through the Spirit, foretells things to come; the latter must use his
learning and facility in speech to translate what he understands. It can hardly be that we
must suppose Tully was inspired with oratorical spirit when he translated Xenophon’s
OEconomics, Plato’s Protagoras, and the oration of Demosthenes in defence of Ctesiphon.
Otherwise the Holy Spirit must have quoted the same books in one sense through the Seventy
Translators, in another through the Apostles, so that, whereas they said nothing of a given
matter, these falsely affirm that it was so written. What then? Are we condemning our predecessors?
By no means; but following the zealous labours of those who have preceded us
we contribute such work as lies in our power in the name of the Lord. They translated before
the Advent of Christ, and expressed in ambiguous terms that which they knew not. We after
His Passion and Resurrection write not prophecy so much as history. For one style is suitable
to what we hear, another to what we see. The better we understand a subject, the better we
describe it. Hearken then, my rival: listen, my calumniator; I do not condemn, I do not
censure the Seventy, but I am bold enough to prefer the Apostles to them all. It is the Apostle
through whose mouth I hear the voice of Christ, and I read that in the classification of
spiritual gifts they are placed before prophets (1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11), while interpreters

on the contrary, I confessed in the very beginning of the Preface that he was a prophet. But
I wished to show what was the opinion upheld by the Jews; and what were the arguments
on which they relied for its proof. I also told the reader that the version read in the Christian
churches was not that of the Septuagint translators but that of Theodotion. It is true, I said
that the Septuagint version was in this book very different from the original, and that it was
condemned by the right judgment of the churches of Christ; but the fault was not mine who
only stated the fact, but that of those who read the version. We have four versions to choose
from: those of Aquila, Symmachus, the Seventy, and Theodotion. The churches choose to
read Daniel in the version of Theodotion. What sin have I committed in following the
judgment of the churches? But when I repeat what the Jews say against the Story of Susanna
and the Hymn of the Three Children, and the fables of Bel and the Dragon, which are not
contained in the Hebrew Bible, the man who makes this a charge against me proves himself
to be a fool and a slanderer; for I explained not what I thought but what they commonly
say against us. I did not reply to their opinion in the Preface, because I was studying brevity,
and feared that I should seem to be writing not a Preface but a book. I said therefore, “As
to which this is not the time to enter into discussion.” Otherwise from the fact that I stated
that Porphyry had said many things against this prophet, and called, as witnesses of this,
Methodius, Eusebius, and Apollinarius, who have replied to his folly in many thousand
lines, it will be in his power to accuse me for not having written in my Preface against the
books of Porphyry. If there is any one who pays attention to silly things like this, I must tell
him loudly and freely that no one is compelled to read what he does not want; that I wrote
for those who asked me, not for those who would scorn me, for the grateful not the carping,
for the earnest not the indifferent. Still, I wonder that a man should read the version of
Theodotion the heretic and judaizer, and should scorn that of a Christian, simple and sinful
though he may be.</p>

<p>34. I beg you, my most sweet friend, who are so curious that you even know my dreams,
and that you scrutinize for purposes of accusations all that I have written during these many
years without fear of future calumny; answer me, how is it you do not know the prefaces of
the very books on which you ground your charges against me? These prefaces, as if by some
prophetic foresight, gave the answer to the calumnies that were coming, thus fulfilling the
proverb, “The antidote before the poison.” What harm has been done to the churches by
my translation? You bought up, as I knew, at great cost the versions of Aquila, Symmachus,
and Theodotion, and the Jewish authors of the fifth and sixth translations. Your Origen, or,
that I may not seem to be wounding you with fictitious praises, our Origen, (for I may call
him ours for his genius and learning, though not for the truth of his doctrines) in all his
books explains and expounds not only the Septuagint but the Jewish versions. Eusebius and
Didymus do the same. I do not mention Apollinarius, who, with a laudable zeal though not
according to knowledge, attempted to patch up into one garment the rags of all the translations,
and to weave a consistent text of Scripture at his own discretion, not according to any
sound rule of criticism. The Hebrew Scriptures are used by apostolic men; they are used, as
is evident, by the apostles and evangelists. Our Lord and Saviour himself whenever he refers
to the Scriptures, takes his quotations from the Hebrew; as in the instance of the words3145
“He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water,” and in the words used on the cross itself, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,” which is by
interpretation “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” not, as it is given by the
Septuagint, “My God, my God, look upon me, why hast thou forsaken me?” and many
similar cases. I do not say this in order to aim a blow at the seventy translators; but I assert
that the Apostles of Christ have an authority superior to theirs. Wherever the Seventy agree
with the Hebrew, the apostles took their quotations from that translation; but, where they
disagree, they set down in Greek what they had found in the Hebrew. And further, I give a
challenge to my accuser. I have shown that many things are set down in the New Testament
as coming from the older books, which are not to be found in the Septuagint; and I have
pointed out that these exist in the Hebrew. Now let him show that there is anything in the
New Testament which comes from the Septuagint but which is not found in the Hebrew,
and our controversy is at an end.</p>

<p>35. By all this it is made clear, first that the version of the Seventy translators which has
gained an established position by having been so long in use, was profitable to the churches,
because that by its means the Gentiles heard of the coming of Christ before he came; secondly,
that the other translators are not to be reproved, since it was not their own works that they
published but the divine books which they translated; and, thirdly, that my own familiar
friend should frankly accept from a Christian and a friend what he has taken great pains to
obtain from the Jews and has written down for him at great cost. I have exceeded the bounds
of a letter; and, though I had taken pen in hand to contend against a wicked heresy, I have
been compelled to make answer on my own behalf, while waiting for my friend’s three
books, and in a state of constant mental suspense about the charges he had heaped up against
me. It is easier to guard against one who professes hostility than to make head against an
enemy who lurks under the guise of a friend.</p>

<head>Book III.</head>
<p>The two first books formed a complete whole, but it was intimated that there might be
more to come when Jerome should have received Rufinus’ work in full. The two first books
were brought to Rufinus by the captain of a merchant-ship trading with Aquileia, together
with a copy of Jerome’s friendly letter which had been suppressed by Pammachius. The
bearer had (as stated by Rufinus, though Jerome mocks at this as impossible) only two days
to wait. Chromatius the Bishop of Aquileia urged that the strife should now cease, and
prevailed so far as that Rufinus made no public reply. He wrote a private letter, however, to
Jerome, which has not come down to us, and which does not seem, from the extracts given
in c. 4, 6, etc., to have been of a pacific tenor. Its details may be gathered from Jerome’s reply.
Jerome intimates that it sought to involve him in heresy, that it renewed and aggravated the
former accusations, speaking of him in language fit only for the lowest characters on the
stage; and that it declared that, if its writer had been so minded, he could have produced
facts which would have been the destruction of his adversary. Jerome, though receiving
some expressions of the desire of Chromatius that he should not reply (perhaps also the
regretful expostulation of Augustin,—Jer. Letter cx, 6, Aug. Letter 73) declared that it was
impossible for him to yield. He could not refrain from defending himself from a capital
charge, nor could he spare the heretics. Peace could only come by unity in the faith.</p>
<p>1. Your letter is full of falsehood and violence. I will try not to take the same tone.</p>
<p>2. Why cannot we differ as friends? Why do you, by threats of death, compel me to answer?</p>
<p>3, 4. Your shameful taunt that I wished to get copies of your Apology by bribing your
Secretary is an imputation to me of practices which are your own.</p>
<p>5. Eusebius should not have accused you; but your charges against him will not stand.</p>
<p>6. You taunt me with boasting of my eloquence. Will you boast of your illiteracy?</p>
<p>7, 8. You wish first to praise, then to amend me, but both with fisticuffs; and make it
impossible for me to keep silence.</p>
<p>9. Why cannot you join with me in condemning Origen, and so put an end to our
quarrel?</p>
<p>10. The assertion that you had only two days for your answer is a fiction.</p>
<p>11. Your translation, contrariwise to my Commentaries, vouches for the soundness of
Origen.</p>
<p>12. You try to shield Origen by falsely attributing the Apology for him to Pamphilus.</p>
<p>13. In my Commentaries my quotation of opposite opinions shows that neither is mine.</p>
<p>14. Had you translated honestly, you would not have had Origen’s heresies imputed to
you.</p>
<p>15. You say the Bishops of Italy accept your views on the Resurrection. I doubt it.</p>

<pb n="1330"/>
<p>16. You rashly say that you will agree to whatever Theophilus lays down. You have to
consider your friendship for Isidore now his enemy.</p>
<p>17, 18. You speak of the Egyptian Bishop Paul. We received him, though an Origenist,
as a stranger; and he has united himself to the orthodox faith. Not only Theophilus
but the Emperors condemn Origen.</p>
<p>19. Against Vigilantius I wrote only what was right. I knew who had stirred him up
against me.</p>
<p>20. As to the letter of Pope Anastasius condemning you, you will find that it is genuine.</p>
<p>21. Siricius who is dead may have written in your favour; Anastasius who is living writes
to the East against you.</p>
<p>22. My departure from Rome for the East had nothing blameable in it as you insinuate.</p>
<p>23. Epiphanius, it is true, gave you the kiss of peace; but he showed afterwards that he
had come to distrust you.</p>
<p>24. When we parted as friends I believed you a true believer; no one was sent to Rome
to injure you.</p>
<p>25. You swear that you did not write my pretended retractation. Your style betrays you,
and I have given a full answer about my translations already.</p>
<p>26. You bid me beware of falsification and treachery. You warn me against yourself.</p>
<p>27. There is nothing inconsistent in praising a man for some things and blaming him
in others. You have done it in my case.</p>
<p>28–31. My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your ignorance as
to the origin of souls. You ought, according to your boasting dream to know
everything. The thing of most importance was forgotten in your cargo of Eastern
wares.</p>
<p>32. Your dream was a boast: mine of which you accuse me humbled me.</p>
<p>33. It was not I who first disclosed your heresies, but Epiphanius long ago and Aterbius
before him.</p>
<p>34–36. As to our translations of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, yours was doing harm, and mine was
necessary in self-defence. You should be glad that heresy is exposed.</p>
<p>37. Your Apology for Origen did not save him but involved you in heresy.</p>
<p>38. My friendly letter was to prevent discord: the other to crush false opinions.</p>
<p>39, 40. Pythagoras was rightly quoted by me. I produce some of his sayings.</p>
<p>41, 42. You threaten me with destruction. I will not reply in the same way. Personalities
should be excluded from controversies of faith.</p>
<p>43, 44. The way of peace is through the wisdom taught in the Book of Proverbs, and
through unity in the faith.</p>

<p>I have read the letter3146 which you in your wisdom have written me. You inveigh
against me, and, though you once praised me and called me true partner and brother, you
now write books to summon me to reply to the charges with which you terrify me. I see that
in you are fulfilled the words of Solomon:3147 “In the mouth of the foolish is the rod of3148
contumely,” and3149 “A fool receives not the words of prudence, unless you say what is
passing in his heart;” and the words of Isaiah:3150 “The fool will speak folly, and his heart
will understand vain things, to practise iniquity and speak falsehood against the Lord.” For
what need was there for you to send me whole volumes full of accusation and malediction,
and to bring them before the public, when in the end of your letter you threaten me with
death if I dare to reply to your slanders—I beg pardon—to your praises? For your praises
and your accusations amount to the same thing; from the same fountain proceed both sweet
and bitter. I beg you to set me the example of the modesty and shamefacedness which you
recommend to me; you accuse another of lying: cease to be a liar yourself. I wish to give no
one an occasion of stumbling, and I will not become your accuser; for I have not to consider
merely what you deserve but what is becoming in me. I tremble at our Savior’s words.3151
“Whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me to stumble, it were better
for him that a great mill stone were hanged about his neck and he were drowned in the
depths of the sea;” and3152 “Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling: for it
must needs be that occasions arise; but woe to the man through whom the occasion cometh.”
It would have been possible for me too to pile up falsehoods against you and to say that I
had heard or seen what no one had observed, so that among the ignorant my effrontery
might be taken for veracity, and my violence for resolution. But far be it from me to be an
imitator of you, and to do myself what I denounce in you. He who is capable of doing filthy
things may use filthy words.3153 “The evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth
forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” You may
count it as good fortune that one whom you once called friend but now accuse has no mind
to make vile imputations against you. I say this not from any dread of the sword of your
accusation, but because I prefer to be accused than to be the accuser, to suffer an injury than
to do one. I know the precept of the Apostle:3154 “Dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but

rather give place unto wrath: for it is written Vengeance is mine, I will repay saith the Lord.

of the Lord.</p>

<p>2. But, before I make my answer to your letter, I must expostulate with you; you who
are first in age among the monks, good presbyter, follower of Christ; is it possible for you
to wish to kill your brother, when even to hate him is to be a homicide? Have you learned
from your Saviour the lesson that if one strike you on the one cheek you should turn to him
the other also? Did not he make answer to the man who struck him,3155 “If I have spoken
evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why smitest thou me?” You threaten me with death,
which can be inflicted on us even by serpents. To die is the lot of all, to commit homicide
only of the weak man. What then? If you do not kill me shall I never die? Perhaps I ought
to be grateful to you that you turn this necessity into a virtue. We read of Apostles quarrelling,
namely Paul and Barnabas who were angry with each other on account of John whose surname
was Mark; those who were united by the bonds of Christ’s gospel were separated for
a voyage; but they still remained friends. Did not the same Paul resist Peter to the face because
he did not walk uprightly in the Gospel? Yet he speaks of him as his predecessor in the
Gospel, and as a pillar of the church; and he lays before him his mode of preaching,3156 ‘lest
he should be running, or had run in vain.’ Do not children differ from parents and wives
from husbands in religious matters, while yet domestic affections remain unimpaired. If
you are as I am, why should you hate me? Even if you believe differently, why should you
wish to kill me? Is it so, that whoever differs from you is to be slain? I call upon Jesus who
will judge what I am now writing and your letter also, as a witness upon my conscience, that
when the reverend bishop Chromatius begged me to keep silence, my wish was to do so,
and thus to make an end of our dissensions, and to overcome evil with good. But, now that
you threaten me with destruction, I am compelled to reply; otherwise, my silence will be
taken as an acknowledgment of the crime, and you will interpret my moderation as the sign
of an evil conscience.</p>

<p>3. The dilemma in which I am placed is of your making: it is brought out, not from the
resources of dialectics, of which you are ignorant, but from among the tools of the murderer
and with an intention like his. If I keep silence, I am held guilty: if I speak, I become an evil
speaker. You at once forbid me to answer and compel me. Well, then; I must shun excess
on both sides. I will say nothing that is injurious; but I must dissipate the charges made
against me, for it is impossible not to be afraid of a man who is prepared to kill you. And I
will do this in the order of what you have now set before me, leaving the rest as they are in
those most learned books of yours which I confuted before I had read them.</p>
<p>You say that ‘you sent your accusation against me not to the many but only to those
who had been offended by what I had said; for one ought to speak to Christians not for
display but for edification.’ Whence then, I beg you to consider, did the report of your
having written these books reach me? Who was it that sowed them broadcast through Rome
and Italy and the islands of the coast of Dalmatia? How did these charges against me ever
come to my ears, if they were only lurking in your desk, and those of your friends? How can
you dare to say that you are speaking as a Christian not for display but for edification when
you set yourself in mature age to say things against your equal which a murderer could
hardly say of a thief, or a harlot against one of her class, or a buffoon against a farce-player?
You have for ever so long been labouring to bring forth these mountains of accusations
against me and sharpening these swords to pierce my throat. Your cries have been as loud
as Ceres’ complaints3157 or a driver’s shouts to his horses. Was this to make all the provinces
through which they resounded read the praise you wrote of me? and recite your panegyrics
upon me in every street, every corner, even in the weaving-shops of the women? This is the
religious restraint and Christian edification of which you speak. Your reserve, your reticence
is such that men come to me from the West, crowd upon crowd, and tell me of your abuse
of me; and this, though only from memory, yet with such exact agreement that I was obliged3158
to make my answer, not to your writings which I had not then read, but to what
was said to be contained in them, and to intercept with the shield of truth the missiles of
mendacity which were flying about through all the world.</p>

<p>4. Your letter goes on:</p>
<p>“Pray do not trouble yourself to give a large sum of gold to bribe my secretary, as your
friends did in the case of my papers containing the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, before they had been corrected
and brought to completion, so that they might more easily falsify documents which
no one possessed, or at least very few. Accept the document which I send you gratis, though
you would be glad to pay a large sum to buy it.”</p>
<p>I should have thought you would be ashamed of such a beginning of your work. What!
I bribe your Secretary! Is there any one who would attempt to vie with the wealth of
Croesus3159 and Darius?3160 who is there that does not tremble when he is suddenly confronted
with a Demaratus3161 or a Crassus?3162 Have you become so brazen-faced, that you
put your trust in lies and think lies will protect you and that we shall believe every fiction
which you choose to frame? Who then was it who stole that letter in which you were so
highly praised, from the cell of our brother Eusebius? Whose artfulness was it, and whose
accomplices, through which a certain document was found in the lodgings of that Christian
woman Fabiola and of that wise man Oceanus, which they themselves had never seen? Do
you think that you are innocent because you can cast upon others all the imputations which
properly belong to you? Is every one who offends you, however guiltless and harmless he
may be, at once held to become a criminal? You think so, I suppose, because you are possessed
of that through which the chastity of Danaë3163 was broken down, that which had more

<p>5. Let us understand what was the wrong done by my friend3165 who, you say ‘falsified
parts of your papers when they had not yet been corrected nor carried to completion, and
it was the more possible to falsify them because very few if any as yet possessed them.’3166
I have already said, and I now repeat, with protestations in the presence of God, that I did
not approve his accusing you, nor of any Christian accusing another Christian; for what
need is there that matters which can be corrected or set right in private should be published
abroad to the stumbling and fall of many? But since each man lives for his own gullet, and
a man does not by becoming your friend become master of your will, while I blame the accusing
of a brother even when it is true, so also I cannot accept against a man of saintly
character this accusation of falsifying your papers. How could a man who only knows Latin
change anything in a translation from the Greek? Or how could he take out or put in anything
in such books as the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, in which everything is so closely knit together that one
part hangs upon another, and anything that may be taken out or put in to suit your will
must at once show out like a patch on a garment? What you ask me to do, it is for you to
do yourself. Put on at least a small measure of natural if not of Christian modesty in your
assertions; do not despise and trample upon your conscience, and imagine yourself justified
by a show of words, when the facts are against you. If Eusebius bought your uncorrected
papers for money in order to falsify them, produce the genuine papers which have not been
falsified: and if you can shew that there is nothing heretical in them, he will become amenable
to the charge of forgery. But, however much you may alter or correct them, you will not
make them out to be catholic. If the error existed only in the words or in some few statements,
what is bad might be cut off and what is good be substituted for it. But, when the whole
discussion3167 proceeds on a single principle, namely, the notion that the whole universe
of reasonable creatures have fallen by their own will, and will hereafter return to a condition
of unity: and that again from that starting point another fall will begin: what is there that
you can amend, unless you alter the whole book? But if you were to think of doing this, you
would no longer be translating another man’s work but composing a work of your own.</p>
<p>However, I hardly see which way your argument tends. I suppose you mean that the
papers being uncorrected and not having undergone a final revising were more easily falsified
by Eusebius. Perhaps I am stupid; but the argument appears to me somewhat foolish and
pointless. If the papers were uncorrected and had not undergone their final revision, the
errors in them must be imputed not to Eusebius but to your sloth and delay in putting off
their correction; and all the blame that can be laid upon him is that he circulated among
<note type="footnote">3165 Necessarius. This no doubt applies to Eusebius of Cremona or to Paulinian, Jerome’s brother, (Jer. Ap.
1, 21, 28.) See Ruf. Ap. i, 19, where a similar charge is made.</note>

<pb n="1337"/>
the body of Christians writings which you had intended in course of time to correct. But if,
as you assert, Eusebius falsified them, why do you put forward the allegation that they were
uncorrected, and that they had gone out before the public without their final revision? For
papers whether corrected or uncorrected are equally susceptible of falsification. But, No
one, you say possessed these books, or very few. What contradictions this single sentence
exhibits! If no one had these books, how could they be in the hands of a few? If a few possessed
them, why do you state falsely that there were none? Then, when you say that a few
had them, and by your own confession the statement that no one had them is overthrown,
what becomes of your complaint that your secretary was bribed with money? Tell us the
secretary’s name, the amount of the bribe, the place, the intermediary, the recipient. Of
course the traitor has been cast off from you, and one convicted of so great a crime has been
separated from all familiarity with you. Is it not more likely to be true that the copies of the
work which Eusebius obtained were given him by those few friends whom you speak of,
especially since these copies agree and coincide with one another so completely that there
is not the difference of a single stroke. We might ask also whether it was quite wise to give
a copy to others which you had not yet corrected? The documents had not received their
last corrections, and yet other men possessed these errors of yours which needed correction.
Do you not see that your falsehood will not hold together? Besides, what profit was there
for you, at that particular moment—how would it have helped you in escaping from the
condemnation of the bishops—that the book which was the subject of discussion should be
open to everyone, and that you should thus be refuted by your own words? From all this it
is clear, according to the epigram of the famous orator, that you have a good will for a lie,
but not the art of framing it.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<p>6. I will follow the order of your letter, and subjoin your very words as you spoke them.
“I admit, that, as you say, I praised your eloquence in my Preface; and I would praise it again
now were it not that contrary to the advice of your Tully, you make it hateful by excessive
boastfulness.” Where have I boasted of my eloquence? I did not even accept willingly the
praise which you bestowed on it. Perhaps your reason for saying this is that you do not wish,
yourself, to be flattered by public praise given in guile. Rest assured you shall be accused
openly; you reject one who would praise you; you shall have experience of one who openly
arraigns you. I was not so foolish as to criticize your illiterate style; no one can expose it to
condemnation so strongly as you do whenever you write. I only wished to show your fellowdisciples
who shared your lack of literary training what progress you had made during your
thirty years in the East, an illiterate writer, who takes impudence for eloquence, and universal
evil speaking a sign of a good conscience. I am not going to administer the ferule; I do not
assume, as you put it, to apply the strokes of the leather thong to teach an aged pupil his
letters. But the fact is your eloquence and teaching is so sparkling that we mere tract-writers
cannot bear it, and you dazzle our eyes with the acuteness of your talents to such an extent
that we must all seem to be envious of you; and we must really join in the attempt to suppress
you, for, if once you obtain the primacy among us as a writer, and stand on the summit of
the rhetorical arch, all of us who profess to know anything will not be allowed to mutter a
word. I am, according to you, a philosopher and an orator, grammarian, dialectician, one
who knows Hebrew, Greek and Latin, a ‘trilingual’ man. On this estimate, you also will be
‘bilingual,’ who know enough Latin and Greek to make the Greek think you a Latin scholar
and the Latin a Greek: and the bishop Epiphanius will be a ‘pentaglossic3168 man’ since he
speaks in five languages against you and your favorite.3169 But I wonder at the rashness
which made you dare to say to one so accomplished as you profess to think me: “You, whose
accomplishments give you so many watchful eyes, how can you be pardoned if you go
wrong? How can you fail to be buried in the silence of a never ending shame?” When I read
this, and reflected that I must somewhere or other have made a slip in my words (for3170
“if any man does not go wrong in word, the same is a perfect man”) and was expecting that
he was about to expose some of my faults; all of a sudden I came upon the words: “Two days
before the carrier of this letter set out your declamation against me was put into my hands.”
What became then of those threats of yours, and of your words: “How can you be pardoned
if you go wrong? How can you fail to be covered with the silence of a never ending shame?”
Yet perhaps, notwithstanding the shortness of the time, you were able to put this in order;
or else you were intending to hire in one of the learned sort, who would expect to find in

my works the ornaments and gems of an eloquence like yours. You wrote before this: “Accept
the document which I send which you wished to buy at a great price;” but now you speak
with the pretence of humility. “I intended to follow your example; but, since the messenger
who was returning to you was hurrying back again I thought it better to write shortly to you
than at greater length to others.” In the meantime you boldly take pleasure in your illiteracy.
Indeed you once confessed it, declaring that ‘it was superfluous to notice a few faults of style,
when it was acknowledged that there were faults in every part.’ I will not therefore find fault
with you for putting down that a document was acquired when you meant that it was bought;
though acquiring is said of things like in kind, whereas buying implies the counting out of
money: nor for such a sentence as “as he who was returning to you was hurrying back again”
which is a redundancy worthy of the poorest style of diction. I will only reply to the arguments,
and will convict you, not of solæcisms and barbarisms, but of falsehood, cunning
and impudence.</p>

<p>7. If it is true that you write a letter to me so as to admonish me, and, because you wish
that I should be reformed, and that you do not wish that men should have a stumbling block
put in their way, and that some may be driven mad and others be put to silence; why do you
write books addressed to others against me, and scatter them by your myrmidons for the
whole world to read? And what becomes of your dilemma in which you try to entangle me,
“Whom, best of masters, did you think to correct? If those to whom you wrote, there was
no fault to find with them; if me whom you accuse, it was not to me that you wrote”? And
I will reply to you in your own words: “Whom did you wish to correct, unlearned master?
Those who had done no wrong? or me to whom you did not write? You think your leaders
are brutish and are all incapable of understanding your subtilty, or rather your ill will, (for
it was in this that the serpent was more subtile than all the beasts in paradise,) in asking that
my admonition to you should be of a private character, when you were pressing an indictment
against me in public. You are not ashamed to call this indictment of yours an Apology: And
you complain that I oppose a shield to your poniard, and with much religiosity and sanctimoniousness
you assume the mask of humility, and say: “If I had erred, why did you write
to others, and not try to confute me?” I will retort on you this very point. What you complain
that I did not do, why did you not do yourself? It is as if a man who is attacking another
with kicks and fisticuffs, and finds him intending to shew fight, should say to him: “Do you
not know the command, ‘If a man smites you on the cheek, turn to him the other’?” It comes
to this, my good sir, you are determined to beat me, to strike out my eye; and then, when I
bestir myself ever so little, you harp upon the precept of the Gospel. Would you like to have
all the windings of your cunning exposed?—those tricks of the foxes who dwell among the
ruins, of whom Ezekiel writes,3171 “Like foxes in the desert, so are thy prophets, O Israel.”
Let me make you understand what you have done. You praised me in your Preface in such
a way that your praises are made a ground of accusation against me, and if I had not declared
myself to be without any connexion with my admirer, I should have been judged as a heretic.
After I repelled your charges, that is your praises, and without shewing ill will to you personally,
answered the accusations, not the accuser, and inveighed against the heretics, to shew
that, though defamed by you, I was a catholic; you grew angry, and raved and composed
the most magnificent works against me; and when you had given them to all men to read
and repeat, letters came to me from Italy, and Rome and Dalmatia, shewing each more
clearly than the last, what all the encomiums were worth with which in your former laudation
you had decorated me.</p>

<p>8. I confess, I immediately set to work to reply to the insinuations directed against me,
and tried with all my might to prove that I was no heretic, and I sent these books of my
Apology to those whom your book had pained, so that your poison might be followed by
my antidote. In reply to this, you sent me your former books, and now send me this last
letter, full of injurious language and accusations. My good friend, what do you expect me
to do? To keep silence? That would be to acknowledge myself guilty. To speak? But you
hold your sword over my head, and threaten me with an indictment, no longer before the
church but before the law-courts. What have I done that deserves punishment? Wherein
have I injured you? Is it that I have shewn myself not to be a heretic? or that I could not esteem
myself worthy of your praises? or that I laid bare in plain words the tricks and perjuries
of the heretics? What is all this to you who boast yourself a true man and a catholic, and
who shew more zeal in attacking me than in defending yourself? Must I be thought to be
attacking you because I defend myself? or is it impossible that you should be orthodox unless
you prove me to be a heretic? What help can it give you to be connected with me? and what
is the meaning of your action? You are accused by one set of people and you answer only
by attacking another. You find an attack made on you by one man, and you turn your back
upon him and attack another who was for leaving you alone.</p>

<p>9. I call Jesus the Mediator to witness that it is against my will, and fighting against necessity,
that I come down into the arena of this war of words, and that, had you not challenged
me, I would have never broken silence. Even now, let your charges against me cease, and
my defence will cease. For it is no edifying spectacle that is presented to our readers, that of
two old men engaging in a gladiatorial conflict on account of a heretic; especially when both
of them wish to be thought catholics. Let us leave off all favouring of heretics, and there will
be no dispute between us. We once were zealous in our praise of Origen; let us be equally
zealous in condemning him now that he is condemned by the whole world. Let us join hands
and hearts, and march with a ready step behind the two trophy-bearers of the East and
West.3172 We went wrong in our youth, let us mend our ways in our age. If you are my
brother, be glad that I have seen my errors; if I am your friend, I must give you joy on your
conversion. So long as we maintain our strife, we shall be thought to hold the right faith not
willingly but of necessity. Our enmity prevents our affording the spectacle of a true repentance.
If our faith is one, if we both of us accept and reject the same things, (and it is from
this, as even Catiline testifies, that firm friendships arise), if we are alike in our hatred of
heretics, and equally condemn our former mistakes, why should we set out to battle against
each other, when we have the same objects both of attack and defence? Pardon me for having
praised Origen’s zeal for Scriptural learning in my youthful days before I fully knew his
heresies; and I will grant you forgiveness for having written an Apology for his works when
your head was grey.</p>

<p>10. You state that my book came into your hands two days before you wrote your letter
to me, and that therefore you had no sufficient leisure to make a reply. Otherwise, if you
had spoken against me after full thought and preparation, we might think that you were
casting forth lightnings rather than accusations. But even so veracious a person as you will
hardly gain credence when you tell us that a merchant of Eastern wares whose business is
to sell what he has brought from these parts and to buy Italian goods to bring over here for
sale, only stayed two days at Aquileia, so that you were obliged to write your letter to me in
a hurried and extempore fashion. For your books which it took you three years to put into
complete shape are hardly more carefully written. Perhaps, however, you had no one at
hand then to amend your sorry productions, and this is the reason why your literary journey
is destitute of the aid of Pallas, and is intersected by faults of style, as by rough places and
chasms at every turn. It is clear that this statement about the two days is false; you would
not have been able in that time even to read what I wrote, much less to reply to it; so that it
is evident that either you took a good many days in writing your letter, which its elaborate
style makes probable; or, if this is your hasty style of composition, and you can write so well
off-hand, you would be very negligent in your composition to write so much worse when
you have had time for thought.</p>

<p>11. You state, with some prevarication, that you have translated from the Greek what I
had before translated into Latin; but I do not clearly understand to what you are alluding,
unless you are still bringing up against me the Commentary on the Ephesians, and hardening
yourself in your effrontery, as if you had received no answer on this head. You stop your
ears and will not hear the voice of the charmer. What I have done in that and other commentaries
is to develop both my own opinion and that of others, stating clearly which are
catholic and which heretical. This is the common rule and custom of those who undertake
to explain books in commentaries: They give at length in their exposition the various opinions,
and explain what is thought by themselves and by others. This is done not only by
those who expound the holy Scriptures but also by those who explain secular books
whether in Greek or in Latin. You, however, cannot screen yourself in reference to the Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν by this fact; for you will be convicted by your own Preface, in which you undertake
that the evil parts and those which have been added by heretics have been cut off but that
all that is best remains; so that all that you have written, whether good or bad, must be held
to be the work, not of the author whom you are translating, but of yourself who have made
the translation. Perhaps, indeed, you ought to have corrected the errors of the heretics, and
to have set forth publicly what is wrong in Origen. But on this point, (since you refer me to
the document itself,) I have made you my answer before reading your letter.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">

<p>12. About the book of Pamphilus, what happened to me was, not comical as you call it,
but perhaps ridiculous; 3173 namely that after I had asserted it to be by Eusebius not by
Pamphilus, I stated at the end of the discussion that I had for many years believed that it
was by Pamphilus, and that I had borrowed a copy of this book from you. You may judge
how little I fear your derision from the fact that even now I make the same statement. I took
it from your manuscript as being a copy of a work of Pamphilus. I trusted in you as a
Christian and as a monk: I did not imagine that you would be guilty of such a wicked imposture.
But, after that the question of Origen’s heresy was stirred throughout the world on
account of your translation of his work, I was more careful in examining copies of the book,
and in the library of Cæsarea I found the six volumes of Eusebius’ Apology for Origen. As
soon as I had looked through them, I at once detected the book on the Son and the Holy
Spirit which you alone have published under the name of the martyr, altering most of its
blasphemies into words of a better meaning. And this I saw must have been done either by
Didymus or by you or some other (it is quite clear that you did it in reference to the Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν) by this decisive proof, that Eusebius tells us that Pamphilus published nothing of
his own. It is for you therefore to say from whence you obtained your copy; and do not, for
the sake of avoiding my accusation, say that it was from some one who is dead, or, because
you have no one to point to, name one who cannot answer for himself. If this rivulet has its
source in your desk, the inference is plain enough, without my drawing it. But, suppose that
the title of this book and the name of the author has been changed by some other lover of
Origen, what motive had you for turning it into Latin? Evidently this, that, through the
testimony given to him by a martyr, all should trust to the writings of Origen, since they
were guaranteed beforehand by a witness of such authority. But the Apology of this most
learned man was not sufficient for you; you must write a treatise of your own in his defence,
and, when these two documents had been widely circulated, you felt secure in proceeding
to translate the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν itself from the Greek, and commended it in a Preface, in which
you said that some things in it had been corrupted by the heretics, but that you had corrected
them from a study of others of Origen’s writings. Then come in your praises of me for the
purpose of preventing any of my friends from speaking against you. You put me forward
as the trumpeter of Origen, you praise my eloquence to the skies, so that you may drag down
the faith into the mire; you call me colleague and brother, and profess yourself the imitator
of my works. Then, while on the one hand you cry me up as having translated seventy
homilies of Origen, and some of his short treatises on the Apostle, in which you say that I
so smoothed things down that the Latin reader will find nothing in them which is discrepant
from the Catholic faith; now on the other hand you brand these very books as heretical;
and, obliterating your former praise, you accuse the man whom you had preached up when
<note type="footnote">3173 non ridiculosa ut tu scribis sed ridicula. Jerome seems to object to ridiculosus as bad Latin.</note>

<pb n="1346"/>
you thought he would figure as your ally, because you find that he is the enemy of your
perfidy. Which of us two is the calumniator of the martyr? I, who say that he was no heretic,
and that he did not write the book which is condemned by every one; or you, who have
published a book written by a man who was an Arian and changed his name into that of
the martyr? It is not enough for you that Greece has been scandalized; you must press the
book upon the ears of the Latins, and dishonor an illustrious martyr as far as in you lies by
your translation. Your intention no doubt was not this; it was not to accuse me but to make
me serve for the defence of Origen’s writings. But let me tell you that the faith of Rome
which was praised by the voice of an Apostle, does not recognize tricks of this kind. A faith
which has been guaranteed by the authority of an Apostle cannot be changed though an
Angel should announce another gospel than that which he preached. Therefore, my brother,
whether the falsification of the book proceeds from you, as many believe, or from another,
as you will perhaps try to persuade us, in which case you have only been guilty of rashness
in believing the composition of a heretic to be that of a martyr, change the title, and free the
innocence of the Romans from this great peril. It is of no advantage to you to be the means
of a most illustrious martyr being condemned as a heretic: of one who shed his blood for
Christ being proud to be an enemy of the Christian faith. Take another course: say, I found
a book which I believed to be the work of a martyr. Do not fear to be a penitent. I will not
press you further. I will not ask from whom you obtained it; you can name some dead man
if you please, or say you bought it from an unknown man in the street: for I do not wish to
see you condemned, but converted. It is better that it should appear that you were in error
than that the martyr was a heretic. At all events, by some means or other, draw out your
foot from its present entanglement: consider what answer you will make in the judgment
to come to the complaints which the martyrs will bring against you.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">

<p>13. Moreover, you make a charge against yourself which has been brought by no one
against you, and make excuses where no one has accused you. You say that you have read
these and in my letter: “I want to know who has given you leave when translating a book,
to remove some things, change others, and again add others.” And you go on to answer
yourself, and to speak against me: “I say this to you Who I pray, has given you leave, in your
Commentaries, to put down some things out of Origen, some from Apollinarius, some of
your own, instead of all from Origen or from yourself or from some other?” All this while,
while you are aiming at something different, you have been preferring a very strong charge
against yourself; and you have forgotten the old proverb, that those who speak falsehood
should have good memories. You say that I in my Commentaries have set down some things
out of Origen, some from Apollinarius, some of my own. If then these things which I have
set down under the names of others are the words of Apollinarius and of Origen; what is
the meaning of the charge which you fasten upon me, that, when I say “Another says this,”
“The following is some one’s conjecture,” that “other” or “some one” means myself? Between
Origen and Apollinarius there is a vast difference of interpretation, of style, and of doctrine.
When I set down discrepant opinions on the same passage, am I to be supposed to accept
both the contradictory views? But more of this hereafter.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">     
<pb n="1348"/>
<p>14. Now I ask you this: Who may have blamed you for having either added or changed
or taken away certain things in the books of Origen, and have put you to the question like
a man on the horse-rack;3174 Are those things which you put down in your translation bad
or good? It is useless for you to simulate innocence, and by some silly question to parry the
force of the true inquiry. I have never accused you for translating Origen for your own satisfaction.
I have done the same, and so have Victorinus, Hilary, and Ambrose; but I have
accused you for fortifying your translation of a heretical work by writing a preface approving
of it. You compel me to go over the same ground, and to walk in the lines I myself have
traced. For you say in that Prologue that you have cut away what had been added by the
heretics; and have replaced it with what is good. If you have taken out the false statement
of the heretics, then what you have left or have added must be either Origen’s, or yours, and
you have set them down, presumably, as good. But that many of these are bad you cannot
deny. “What is that,” you will say, “to me?” You must impute it to Origen; for I have done
no more than alter what had been added by the heretics. Tell us then for what reason you
took out the bad things written by the heretics and left those written by Origen untouched.
Is it not clear that parts of the false doctrines of Origen you condemned under the designation
of the doctrines of heretics, and others you accepted because you judged them to be not
false but true and consonant with your faith? It was these last about which I inquired
whether those things which you praised in your Preface were good or bad: it was these which
you confessed you have left as perfectly good when you cut out all that was worst; and I thus
have placed you, as I said, on the horse-rack, so that, if you say that they are good, you will
be proved to be a heretic, but if you say they are bad, you will at once be asked: “Why then
did you praise these bad things in your Preface?” And I did not add the question which you
craftily pretend that I asked; “Why did you by your translation bring evil doctrines to the
ears of the Latins?” For to exhibit what is bad may be done at times not for the sake of
teaching them but of warning men against them: so that the reader may be on his guard not
to follow the error, but may make light of the evils which he knows, whereas if unknown
they might become objects of wonder to him. Yet after this, you dare to say that I am the
author of writings of this kind, whereas you, as a mere translator would be going beyond
the translator’s province if you had chosen to correct anything, but, if you did not correct
anything, you acted as a translator alone. You would be quite right in saying this if your
translation of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν had no Preface; just as Hilary, when he translated Origen’s
homilies took care to do it so that both the good and evil of them should be imputed not to
the translator but to their own author. If you had not boasted that you had cut out the worst
and left the best, you would, in some way or other, have escaped from the mire. But it is this
that brings to nought the trick of your invention, and keeps you bound on all sides, so that
<note type="footnote">3174 Equuleus, the little horse, an instrument of torture.</note>

<pb n="1349"/>
you cannot get out. And I must ask you not to have too mean an opinion of the intelligence
of your readers nor to think that all who will read your writings are so dull as not to laugh
at you when they see you let real wounds mortify while you put plasters on a healthy body.</p>

<p>15. What your opinions are on the resurrection of the flesh, we have already learned
from your Apology. “No member will be cut off, nor any part of the body destroyed.” This
is the clear and open profession which you make in your innocence, and which you say is
accepted by all the bishops of Italy. I should believe your statement, but that the matter of
that book which is not Pamphilus’ makes me doubt about you. And I wonder that Italy
should have approved what Rome rejected; that the bishops should have accepted what the
Apostolic see condemned.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">

<p>16. You further write that it was by my letters that you had been informed that the pope
Theophilus lately put forth an exposition of the faith which has not yet reached you and
you promise to accept whatever he may have written. I am not aware that I ever said this,
or that I sent any letters of the sort. But you consent to things of which you are still in uncertainty,
and things as to which you do not know what and of what kind they will turn out
to be, so that you may avoid speaking of things which you know quite well, and may not be
bound by the consent you have given to them. There are two letters of Theophilus,3175 a
Synodal and a Paschal letter, against Origen and his disciples, and others against Apollinarius
and against Origen also, which, within the last two years or thereabouts, I have translated
and given to the men who speak our language for the edification of the church. I am not
aware that I have translated anything else of his. But, when you say that you assent to the
opinion of the pope Theophilus in everything, you must take care not to let your masters
and disciples hear you, and not to offend these numerous persons who call me a robber and
you a martyr, and also not to provoke the wrath of the man3176 who wrote letters to you
against the bishop Epiphanius, and exhorted you to stand fast in the truth of the faith, and
not to change your opinion for any terror. This epistle in its complete form is held by those
to whom it was brought. After this you say, after your manner: “I will satisfy you even when
you rage against me, as I have in the matter you spoke of before.” But again you say, “What
do you want? have you anything more at which you may shoot with the bow of your oratory?”
And yet you are indignant if I find fault with your distasteful way of speaking, though you
take up the lowest expressions of the Comedians, and in writing on church affairs adopt
language fit only for the characters of harlots and their lovers on the stage.</p>

<p>17. Now, as to the question which you raise, when it was that I began to admit the authority
of the pope Theophilus, and was associated with him in community of belief. You
make answer to yourself: “Then, I suppose, when you were the supporter of Paul whom he
had condemned and made the greatest effort to help him, and instigated him to recover
through an imperial rescript the bishopric from which he had been removed by the episcopal
tribunal.” I will not begin by answering for myself, but first speak of the injury which you
have here done to another. What humanity or charity is there in rejoicing over the misfortunes
of others and in exhibiting their wounds to the world? Is that the lesson you have
learned from that Samaritan who carried back the man that was half dead to the inn? Is this
what you understand by pouring oil into his wounds, and paying the host his expenses? Is
it thus that you interpret the sheep brought back to the fold, the piece of money recovered,
the prodigal son welcomed back? Suppose that you had a right to speak evil of me, because
I had injured you, and, to use your words, had goaded you to madness and stimulated you
to evil speaking: what harm had a man who remains in obscurity done you, that you should
lay bare his scars, and when they were skinned over, should tear them open by inflicting
this uncalled for pain? Even if he was worthy of your reproaches, were you justified in doing
this? If I am not mistaken, those whom you wish to strike at through him (and I speak the
open opinion of many) are the enemies of the Origenists; you use the troubles of one of
them to show your violence against both.3177 If the decisions of the pope Theophilus so
greatly please you, and you think it impious that an episcopal decree should be nullified,
what do you say about the rest of those whom he has condemned? And what do you say
about the pope Anastasius, about whom you assert most truly that no one thinks him capable
as the bishop of so great a city, of doing an injury to an innocent or an absent man? I do not
say this because I set myself up as a judge of episcopal decisions, or wish what they have
determined to be rescinded; but I say, Let each of them do what he thinks right at his own
risk, it is for him alone to consider how his judgment will be judged. Our duties in our
monastery are those of hospitality; we welcome all who come to us with the smile of human
friendliness. We must take care lest it should again happen that Mary and Joseph do not
find room in the inn, and that Jesus should be shut out and say to us, “I was a stranger and
ye took me not in.” The only persons we do not welcome are heretics, who are the only
persons who are welcomed by you: for our profession binds us to wash the feet of those who
come to us, not to discuss their merits. Bring to your remembrance, my brother, how he
whom we speak of had confessed Christ: think of that breast which was gashed by the
scourges: recall to mind the imprisonment he had endured, the darkness, the exile, the work
in the mines, and you will not be surprised that we welcomed him as a passing guest. Are

<p>18. I can tell you of something which may make him still dearer to us, though more
odious to you. A short time ago, the faction of the heretics which was scattered away from
Egypt and Alexandria came to Jerusalem, and wished to make common cause with him, so
that as they suffered together, they might have the same heresy imputed to them. But he
repelled their advances, he scorned and cast them from him: he told them that he was not
an enemy of the faith and was not going to take up arms against the Church: that his previous
action had been the result of vexation not of unsoundness in the faith; and that he had
sought only to prove his own innocence, not to attack that of others. You profess to consider
an imperial rescript upsetting an episcopal decree to be an impiety. That is a matter for the
responsibility of the man who obtained it. But what is your opinion of men who, when they
have been themselves condemned, haunt the palaces of the great, and in a serried column
make an attack on a single man who represents the faith of Christ? However, as to my own
communion with the Pope Theophilus, I will call no other witness than the very man whom
you pretend that I injured.3178 His letters were always addressed to me, as you well know,
even at the time when you prevented their being forwarded to me, and when you used daily
to send letter carriers to him repeating to him with vehemence that his opponent was my
most intimate friend, and telling the same falsehoods which you now shamelessly write, so
that you might stir up his hatred against me and that his grief at the supposed injury done
him might issue in oppression against me in matters of faith. But he, being a prudent man
and a man of apostolical wisdom, came through time and experience to understand both
our loyalty to him and your plots against us. If, as you declare, my followers stirred up a
plot against you at Rome and stole your uncorrected manuscripts while you were asleep;
who was it that stirred up the pope Theophilus against the public enemy in Egypt? Who
obtained the decrees of the princes against them, and the consent of the whole of this quarter
of the world? Yet you boast that you from your youth were the hearer and disciple of
Theophilus, although he, before he became a bishop, through his native modesty, never
taught in public, and you, after he became a Bishop, were never at Alexandria. Yet you dare,
in order to deal a blow at me, to say “I do not accuse, or change, my masters.” If that were
true it would in my opinion throw a grave suspicion on your Christian standing. As for
myself, you have no right to charge me with condemning my former teachers: but I stand
in awe of those words of Isaiah:3179 “Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that
put darkness for light and light for darkness, that call bitter sweet and sweet bitter.” But it
is you who drink alike the honeywine of your masters and their poisons, who have fallen
away from your true master the Apostle, who teaches that neither he himself or an angel, if
they err in matters of faith, must not be followed.</p>

<p>19. You allude to Vigilantius. What dream this is that you have dreamed about him I
do not know. Where have I said that he was defiled by communion with heretics at Alexandria?
Tell me the book, produce the letter: but you will find absolutely no such statement.
Yet with your wonted carelessness of statement or rather impudence of lying, which makes
you imagine that every one will believe what you say, you add: “When you quoted a text of
Scripture against him in so insulting a way that I do not dare to repeat it with my own
mouth.” You do not dare to repeat it because you can make the charge seem worse by
keeping silence; and, because your accusation has no facts to rest upon, you simulate modesty,
so that the reader may imagine that you are acting from consideration towards me, although
your lies show that you do not consider your own soul. What is this text of Scripture which
is too shameful to proceed out of that most shameless mouth of yours? What shameful thing,
indeed, can you mention in the sacred books? If you are ashamed to speak, at any rate you
can write it down, and then I shall be convinced of wantonness by my own words. I might
be silent on all other points, and I should still prove by this single passage how brazen is
your effrontery. You know how little I fear your impeachment. If you produce the evidence
with which you threaten me, all the blame which now rests on you will rest on me. I gave
my reply to you when I dealt with Vigilantius; for he brought the same charges against me
which you bring first in the guise of friendly eulogy, afterwards in that of hostile accusation.
I am aware who it was that stirred up his ravings against me; I know your plots and vices;
I am not ignorant of his simplicity which is proclaimed by every one. Through his folly your
hatred against me found an outlet for its fury; and, if I wrote a letter to suppress it, so that
you should not be thought to be the only one who possesses a literary cudgel, that does not
justify you in inventing shameful expressions which you can find in no part of my writings
whatever. You must accept and confess the fact that the same document which answered
his madness aroused also your calumnies.</p>

<p>20. In the matter of the letter of the pope Anastasius, you seem to have come on a slippery
place; you walk unsteadily, and do not see where to plant your feet. At one moment you say
that it must have been written by me; at another that it ought to have been transmitted to
you by him to whom it was sent. Then again you charge the writer with injustice; or you
protest that it matters nothing to you whether he wrote it or not, since you hold his predecessor’s
testimonial, and, while Rome was begging you to give her the honor of your presence,
you disdained her through love of your own little town. If you have any suspicion that the
letter was forged by me, why do you not ask for it in the chartulary of the Roman See and
then, when you discover that it was not written by the bishop, hold me manifestly guilty of
the crime? You would then instead of trying to bind me with cobwebs, hold me fast bound
in a net of strong cords. But if it is as written by the Bishop of Rome, it is an act of folly on
your part to ask for a copy of the letter from one to whom it was not sent, and not from him
who sent it, and to send to the East for evidence the source of which you have in your own
country. You had better go to Rome and expostulate with him as to the reproach which he
has directed against you when you were both absent and innocent. You might first point
out that he had refused to accept your exposition of faith, which, as you say, all Italy has
approved, and that he made no use of your literary cudgel against the dogs you spoke of.
Next, you might complain that he had sent to the East a letter aimed at you which branded
you with the mark of heresy, and said that by your translation of Origen’s books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν
the Roman church which had received the work in its simplicity was in danger of losing the
sincerity of faith which it had learned from the Apostle; and that he had raised yet more ill
will against you by daring to condemn this very book, though it was fortified by the attestation
of your Preface. It is no light thing that the pontiff of so great a city should have fastened
this charge upon you or have rashly taken it up when made by another. You should go about
the streets vociferating and crying over and over again, “It is not my book, or, if it is, the
uncorrected sheets were stolen by Eusebius. I published it differently, indeed I did not
publish it at all; I gave it to nobody, or at all events to few; and my enemy was so unscrupulous
and my friends so negligent, that all the copies alike were falsified by him.” This, my dearest
brother, is what you ought to have done, not to turn your back upon him and to direct the
arrows of your abuse across the sea against me; for how can it cure your wounds that I
should be wounded? Does it comfort a man who is stricken for death to see his friend dying
with him?</p>

<p>21. You produce a letter of Siricius3180 who now sleeps in Christ, and the letter of the
living Anastasius you despise. What injury you ask, can it do you that he should have written
(or perhaps not written at all) when you knew nothing of it? If he did write, still it is enough
for you that you have the witness of the whole world in your favor, and that no one thinks
it possible that the bishop of so great a city could have done an injury to an innocent man,
or even to one who was simply absent. You speak of yourself as innocent, though your
translation made all Rome shudder; you say you were absent, but it is only because you dare
not reply when you are accused. And you so shrink from the judgment of the city of Rome
that you prefer to subject yourself to an invasion of the barbarians3181 than to the opinion
of a peaceful city. Suppose that the letter of last year was forged by me; who then wrote the
letters which have lately been received in the East? Yet in these last the pope Anastasius pays
you such compliments that, when you read them, you will be more inclined to set to work
to defend yourself than to accuse me.</p>
<p>I should like you to consider how inevitable is the wisdom which you are shunning and
the Attic Salt and the eloquence of your diction in religious writing. You are attacked by
others, you are pierced through by their condemnation, yet it is against me that you toss
yourself about in your fury, and say: “I could unfold a tale as to the manner of your departure
from Rome; as to the opinions expressed about you at the time, and written about you afterwards,
as to your oath, the place where you embarked, the pious manner in which you
avoided committing perjury; all this I could enlarge upon, but I have determined to keep
back more than I relate.” These are specimens of your pleasant speeches. And if after this I
say anything sharp in answer to you threaten me with immediate proscription and with the
sword. You are a most eloquent person, and have all the tricks of rhetoric; you pretend to
be passing over things which you really reveal, so that what you cannot prove by an open
charge, you may make into a crime by seeming to put it aside. All this is your simplicity;
this is what you mean by sparing your friend and reserving your statements for the judicial
tribunal; you spare me by heaping up a mass of charge against me.</p>

<p>22. If any one wishes to hear the arrangements for my journey from Rome, they were
these. In the month of August,3182 when the etesian winds were blowing, accompanied by
the reverend presbyter Vincentius and my young brother, and other monks who are now
living at Jerusalem, I went on board ship at the port of Rome, choosing my own time, and
with a very large body of the saints attending me, I arrived at Rhegium. I stood for a while
on the shore of Scylla, and heard the old stories of the rapid voyage of the versatile Ulysses,
of the songs of the sirens and the insatiable whirlpool of Charybdis. The inhabitants of that
spot told me many tales, and gave me the advice that I should sail not for the columns of
Proteus but for the port where Jonah landed, because the former of those was the course
suited for men who were hurried and flying, but the latter was best for a man who was imprisoned;
but I preferred to take the course by Malea and the Cyclades to Cyprus. There I
was received by the venerable bishop Epiphanius, of whose testimony to you you boast. I
came to Antioch, where I enjoyed the communion of Paulinius the pontiff and confessor
and was set forward by him on my journey to Jerusalem, which I entered in the middle of
winter and in severe cold. I saw there many wonderful things, and verified by the judgment
of my own eyes things which had before come to my ears by report. Thence I made my way
to Egypt. I saw the monasteries of Nitria, and perceived the snakes3183 which lurked among
the choirs of the monks. Then making haste I at once returned to Bethlehem, which is now
my home, and there poured my perfume upon the manger and cradle of the Saviour. I saw
also the lake of ill-omen. Nor did I give myself to ease and inertness, but I learned many
things which I did not know before. As to what judgment was formed of me at Rome, or
what was written afterwards, you are quite welcome to speak out, especially since you have
writings to trust to; for I am not to be tried by your words which you at your will either veil
in enigma or blurt out with open falsehood, but by the documents of the church. You may
see how little I am afraid of you. If you can produce against me a single record of the Bishop
of Rome or of any other church, I will confess myself to be chargeable with all the iniquities
which I find assigned to you. It would be easy for me to tell of the circumstances of your
departure, your age, the date of sailing, the places in which you lived, the company you kept.
But far be it from me to do what I blame you for doing, and in a discussion between
churchmen, to make up a story worthy of the ravings of quarrelling hags. Let this word be
enough for your wisdom to remember. Do not adopt a method with another which can at
once be retorted on yourself.</p>

<p>23. As regards our reverend friend Epiphanius, this is strange shuffling of yours, when
you say that it was impossible for him to have written against you after his giving you the
kiss and joining with you in prayer. It is as if you were to contend that he would not be dead
if a short time before he had been alive, or as if it were not equally certain that he had first
reproved you and then, after the kiss of peace, excommunicated you. “They went out from
us,” it is said,3184 “but they were not of us; otherwise they would no doubt have continued
with us.” The apostle bids us avoid a heretic after first and second admonition: of course
this implies that he was a member of the flock of the church before he was avoided or condemned.
I confess I cannot restrain my laughter when, at the prompting of some clever
person, you strike up a hymn in honour of Epiphanius. Why, this is the ‘silly old man,’ the
‘anthropomorphite,’ this is the man who boasted in your presence of the six thousand books
of Origen that he had read, who ‘thinks himself entrusted with the preaching of the Gospel
against Origen among all nations in their own tongue’ who ‘will not let others read Origen
for fear they should discover what he has stolen from him.’ Read what he has written, and
the letter, or rather letters, one of which I will adduce as a testimonial to your orthodoxy,
so that it may be seen how worthy he is of your present praise.3185 “May God set you free,
my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is entrusted to you, and all the brethren
who are with you, and especially the Presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and all
other heresies, and from the perdition which they bring. For if many heresies have been
condemned by the Church on account of one word or of two, which are contrary to the
faith, how much more must that man be counted a heretic who has invented so many perverse
things, so many false doctrines! He stands forth as the enemy of God and of the church.”
This is the testimony which this saintly man bears to you. This is the garland of praise which
he gives you to parade in. Thus runs the letter which your golden coins extracted from the
chamber of our brother Eusebius, so that you might calumniate the translator of it, and
might fix upon me the guilt of a most manifest crime—that of rendering a Greek word as
‘dearest’ which ought to have been ‘honourable!’ But what is all this to you who can control
all events by your prudent methods, and can trim your path between different possibilities,
first saying, if you can find any one to believe you, that neither Anastasius nor Epiphanius
ever wrote a line against you; and, secondly, when their actual letters cry out against you,
and break down your audacious effrontery, despising the judgment of them both, and say
it does not matter to you whether they wrote or not, since it was impossible for them to
write against an innocent and an absent man.</p>
<p>Then again, you have no right to speak evil of that saintly man, as you do when you say
“that it may be seen that he gave me peace with his words and his kiss, but kept evil and

<pb n="1360"/>
deceit in his heart”—for this is your reasoning, and it is thus that you defend yourself. That
this is the letter of Epiphanius and that it is hostile to you, all the world knows: and that it
came in its genuine form into your hands we can prove; and it is therefore an astounding
shame or rather utter shamelessness in you to deny what you cannot doubt to be true. What!
Is Epiphanius to be befouled with the imputation that he gave you the sign of peace but had
deceit in his heart? Is it not much truer to believe that he first admonished you because he
wished to save you from error and bring you back to the right way; and that therefore he
did not reject your Judas kiss, wishing to break down by his forbearance the betrayer of the
faith,—but that afterwards when he found that all his toil was fruitless, and that the leopard
could not change its spots nor the Ethiopian his skin, he proclaimed in his letter what had
before been only a suspicion in his mind?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">

<p>24. It is somewhat the same argument which you use against the pope Anastasius,
namely, that, since you hold the letters of the bishop Siricius, it was impossible that he should
write against you. I am afraid you suspect that some injury has been done you. I cannot
understand how a man of your acuteness and capacity can condescend to such nonsense;
you suppose that your readers are foolish, but you shew that you are foolish yourself. Then
after this extraordinary argumentation, you subjoin this little sentence: “Far be such conduct
from these reverend persons. It is from your school that such actions proceed. You gave us
all the signs of peace at our departure, and then threw missiles charged with venom from
behind our backs.” In this clause or rather declamatory speech, you intended, no doubt, to
shew your rhetorical skill. It is true we gave you the signs of peace, but not to embrace heresy;
we joined hands, we accompanied you as you set forth on your journey, on the understanding
that you were catholic not that we were heretical. But I want to learn what these poisoned
missiles are which you complain that I threw from behind your back. I sent the presbyters,
Vincentius, Paulinianus, Eusebius, Rufinus. Of these, Vincentius went to Rome long before
you; Paulinianus and Eusebius set out a year after you had sailed; Rufinus two years after,
for the cause of Claudius; all of them either for private reasons, or because another was in
peril of his life. Was it possible for me to know that when you entered Rome, a nobleman
had dreamed that a ship full of merchandise was entering with full blown sails? or that all
questions about fate were being solved by a solution which should not itself be fatuous? or
that you were translating the book of Eusebius as if it were Pamphilus’? or that you were
putting your own cover upon Origen’s poisoned dish by lending your majestic eloquence
to this translation of his notorious work Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν? This is a new way of calumniating a
man. We sent out the accusers before you had committed the crime. It was not, I repeat, it
was not by our plan, but by the providence of God, that these men, who were sent out for
another reason, came to fight against the rising heresy. They were sent, like Joseph, to relieve
the coming famine by the fervour of their faith.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">

<p>25. To what point will not audacity burst forth when once it is freed from restraints?
He has imputed to himself the charge made against another so that we may be thought to
have invented it. I made a charge against some one unnamed, and he takes it as spoken
against himself; he purges himself from another man’s sins, being only sure of his own innocence.
For he takes his oath that he did not write the letter that passed under my name
to the African bishops, in which I am made to confess that I had been induced by Jewish
influence to make false translations of the Scriptures; and he sends me writings which contain
all these things which he declares to be unknown to him. It is remarkable to know how his
subtlety has coincided with another man’s malice, so that the lies which this other told in
Africa, he in accord with him declared to be true; and also how that elegant style of his could
be imitated by some chance and unskilled person. You alone have the privilege of translating
the venom of the heretics, and of making all nations drink a draught from the cup of Babylon.
You may correct the Latin Scriptures from the Greek. and may deliver to the Churches to
read something different from what they received from the Apostles; but I am not to be allowed
to go behind the Septuagint version which I translated after strict correction for the
men of my native tongue a great many years ago, and, for the confutation of the Jews, to
translate the actual copies of the Scriptures which they confess to be the truest, so that when
a dispute arises between them and the Christians, they may have no place of retreat and
subterfuge, but may be smitten most effectually with their own spear. I have written pretty
fully on this point if I rightly remember, in many other places, especially in the end of my
second book; and I have checked your popularity-hunting, with which you seek to arouse
ill will against me among the innocent and the inexperienced, by a clear statement of fact.
To that I think it enough to refer the reader.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">     
<pb n="1363"/>
<p>26. I think it a point which should not be passed over, that you have no right to complain
that the falsifier of your papers holds in my esteem the glorious position of a confessor, since
you who are guilty of this very crime are called a martyr and an apostle by all the partisans
of Origen, for that exile and imprisonment of yours at Alexandria. On your alleged inexperience
in Latin composition I have answered you above. But, since you repeat the same things,
and, as if forgetful of your former defence, again remind me that I ought to know that you
have been occupied for thirty years in devouring Greek books, and therefore do not know
Latin, I would have you observe that it is not a few words of yours with which I find fault,
though indeed all your writing is worthy of being destroyed. What I wished to do was to
shew your followers, whom you have taken so much pains in teaching to know nothing, to
understand what amount of modesty there is in a man who teaches what he does not know,
who writes what he is ignorant of, so that they may expect to find the same wisdom in his
opinions. As to what you add “That it is not faults of words which are offensive, but sins,
such as lying, calumny, disparagement, false witness, and all evil speaking, and that the
mouth which speaketh lies kills the soul,” and your deprecation, “Let not that ill-savour
reach my nostrils;” I would believe what you say, were it not that I discover facts inconsistent
with this. It is as if a fuller or a tanner in speaking to a dealer in pigments should warn him
that he had better hold his nose as he passed their shops. I will do what you recommend; I
will stop my nose, so that it may not be put to the torture by the delightful odour of your
truth-speaking and your benedictions.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">     
<pb n="1364"/>
<p>27. In reference to your alternate praise and disparagement of me, you argue with great
acuteness that you have the same right to speak good and evil of me that I have to find fault
with Origen and Didymus whom I once praised. I must instruct you, then, wisest of men
and chief of Roman dialecticians, that there is no fault of logic in praising a man in certain
respects while you blame him in others, but only in approving and disapproving one and
the same thing. I will take an example, so that, though you may not understand, the wise
reader may join me in understanding the point. In the case of Tertullian we praise his great
talent, but we condemn his heresy. In that of Origen we admire his knowledge of the
Scriptures, but nevertheless we do not accept his false doctrine. As to Didymus, however,
we extol both his powers of memory, and the purity of his faith in the Trinity, while on the
other point in which he erred in trusting to Origen we withdraw from him. The vices of our
teachers are not to be imitated, their virtues are. There was a man at Rome who had an
African, a very learned man, as his grammar teacher; and he thought that he was rising to
an equality with his teacher because he copied his strident voice and his faulty pronunciation.
You in your Preface to the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν speak of me as your brother and call me your most
eloquent colleague, and proclaim my soundness in the faith. From these three points you
cannot draw back; carp at me on all other points as you please, so long as you do not openly
contradict this testimony which you bear to me; for in calling me friend and colleague, you
confess me worthy of your friendship; when you proclaim me an eloquent man, you cannot
go on accusing me of ignorance; and when you confess that I am in all points a catholic,
you cannot fix on me the guilt of heresy. Beyond these three points you may charge me with
anything you like without openly contradicting yourself. From all this calculation the net
result is that you are wrong in blaming in me what you formerly praised; but that I am not
in fault when, in the case of the same men, I praise what is laudable and blame what is censurable.</p>

which you say I raise. You want to be allowed to express ignorance on a point on which you
advisedly dissemble your knowledge; and therefore begin questioning me about angels and
archangels; as to the mode of their existence, the place and nature of their abodes, the differences,
if there be any, existing between them; and then as to the course of the sun, the waxing
and waning of the moon, the character and movements of the stars. I wonder that you did
not set down the whole of the lines:3186

<l>Whence come the earthquakes, whence the high-swoll’n seas</l>
<l>Breaking their bounds, then sinking back to rest;</l>
<l>The Sun’s eclipse, the labours of the moon;</l>

<l>Arcturus’ rainy Hyads, and the Bears:</l>
<l>Why haste the winter’s suns to bathe themselves</l>
<l>Beneath the wave, what stays its lingering nights.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Then, leaving things in heaven, and condescending to those on earth, you philosophize
on minor points. You say: “Tell us what are the causes of the fountains, and of the wind;
what makes the hail and the showers; why the sea is salt, the rivers sweet; what account is
to be given of clouds and storms, thunderbolts, and thunder and lightning.” You mean that
if I do not know all this, you are entitled to say you know nothing about the origin of souls.
You wish to balance your ignorance on a single point by mine on many. But do not you,
who in page after page stir up what you call my smoke, understand that I can see your mists
and whirlwinds? You wish to be thought a man of extensive knowledge, and among the
disciples of Calpurnius3187 to enjoy a great reputation for wisdom, and therefore you raise
up the whole physical world in front of me, as if Socrates had said in vain when he passed
over to the study of Ethics: “What is above us is nothing to us.” So then, if I cannot tell you
why the ant, which is such a little creature, whose body is a mere point, has six feet, whereas
an elephant with its vast bulk has only four to walk on; why serpents and snakes glide along
on their chests and bellies; why the worm which is commonly called the millipede has such
a swarming array of feet; I am prohibited from knowing anything about the origin of souls!
You ask me what I know about souls, so that, when I make any statement about them, you
may at once attack it. And if I say that the church’s doctrine is that God forms souls every
day, and sends them into the bodies of those who are born, you will at once bring out the

<pb n="1366"/>
snares your master invented, and ask, Where is God’s justice if he grants souls to those who
are born of adultery or incest? Is he not an accessory to men’s sins, if he creates souls for
the adulterers who make the bodies? as if, when you hear that seed corn had been stolen,
you are to suppose the fault to lie in the nature of the corn, and not in the man who stole
the wheat; and that therefore the earth had no business to nourish the seed in its bosom,
because the hands of the sower who cast them in were unclean. Hence comes also your
mysterious question, Why do infants die? since it is because of their sins, as you hold, that
they received bodies. There exists a treatise of Didymus addressed to you, in which he meets
this inquiry of yours, with the answer, that they had not sinned much, and therefore it was
enough punishment for them just to have touched their bodily prisons. He, who was your
master and mine also, when you asked this question, wrote at my request three books of
comments on the prophet Hosea, and dedicated them to me. This shows what parts of his
teaching we respectively accepted.</p>

could repeat to you the views of Lucretius who follows Epicurus, or those of Aristotle as
taught by the Peripatetics, or of Plato and Zeno by the Academics and the Stoics. Passing
to the church, where we have the rule of truth, the books of Genesis and the Prophets and
Ecclesiastes, give us much information on questions of this kind. But if we profess ignorance
about all these things, as also about the origin of souls, you ought in your Apology to acknowledge
your ignorance of all alike, and to ask your calumniators why they had the impudence
to force you to reply on this single point when they themselves know nothing of
all those great matters. But Oh! how vast was the wealth contained in that trireme3188 which
had come full of all the wares of Egypt and the East to enrich the poverty of the city of Rome.

among the mathematici,3190 and all Christians would still be ignorant of what might be said
against fatalism. You have a right to ply me with questions about astrology and the cause
of the sky and the stars, when you brought to land a ship full of such wares as these. I acknowledge
my poverty; I have not grown rich to this extent in the East like you. You learned
in your long sojourn under the shadow of the Pharos what Rome never knew: Egypt instructed
you in lore which Italy did not possess till now.</p>

<p>30. Your Apology says that there are three opinions as to the origin of souls: one held
by Origen, a second by Tertullian and Lactantius (as to Lactantius what you say is manifestly
false), a third by us simple and foolish men, who do not see that, if our opinion is true, God
is thereby shewn to be unjust. After this you say that you do not know what is the truth. I
say, then, tell me, whether you think that outside of these three opinions any truth can be
found so that all these three may be false; or whether you think one of these three is true. If
there is some other possibility, why do you confine the liberty of discussion within a closedrawn
line? and why do you put forward the views which are false and keep silence about
the true? But if one of the three is true and the two others false, why do you include false
and true in one assertion of ignorance? Perhaps you pretend not to know which is true in
order that it may be safe for you, whenever you may please, to defend the false. This is the
smoke, these are the mists, with which you try to keep away the light from men’s eyes. You
are the Aristippus3191 of our day: you bring your ship into the port of Rome full of merchandize
of all kinds; you set your professorial chair on high, and represent to us
Hermagoras3192 and Gorgias3193 of Leontinum: only, you were in such a hurry to set sail
that you left one little piece of goods, one little question, forgotten in the East. And you cry
out with reiteration that you learned both at Aquileia and at Alexandria that God is the
creator of both our bodies and our souls. This then, forsooth, is the pressing question,
whether our souls were created by God or by the devil, and not whether the opinion of
Origen is true that our souls existed before our bodies and committed some sin because of
which they have been tied to these gross bodies; or whether, again, they slept like dormice
in a state of torpor and of slumber. Every one is asking this question, but you say nothing
about it; nobody asks the other, but to that you direct your answer.</p>

say, to know what I do not know, and the parade I make of great teachers to deceive the
common and ignorant people. You, of course, are a man not of smoke but of flame, or rather
of lightning; you fulminate when you speak; you cannot contain the flames which have been
conceived within your mouth, and like Barchochebas,3194 the leader of the revolt of the
Jews, who used to hold in his mouth a lighted straw and blow it out so as to appear to be
breathing forth flame: so you also, like a second Salmoneus,3195 brighten the whole path on
which you tread, and reproach us as mere men of smoke, to whom perhaps the words might
be applied,3196 “Thou touchest the hills and they smoke.” You do not understand the allusion
of the Prophet3197 when he speaks of the smoke of the locusts; it is no doubt the beauty of
your eyes which makes it impossible for you to bear the pungency of our smoke.</p>

<p>32. As to your charge of perjury, since you refer me to your book; and since I have made
my reply to you and Calpurnius3198 in the previous books, it will be sufficient here to observe
that you exact from me in my sleep what you have never yourself fulfilled in your waking
hours. It seems that I am guilty of a great crime because I have told girls and virgins of
Christ, that they had better not read secular works, and that I once promised when warned
in a dream not to read them. But your ship which was announced by revelation to the city
of Rome, promises one thing and effects another. It came to do away with the puzzle of the
mathematici: what it does is to do away with the faith of Christians. It had made its run with
sails full set over the Ionian and Ægean, the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas, only to make
shipwreck in the Roman port. Are you not ashamed of hunting up nonsense of this kind
and putting me to the trouble of bringing up similar things against you? Suppose that some
one had seen a dream about you such as might make you vainglorious; it would have been
modest as well as wise in you not to seem to know of it, instead of boasting of other people’s
dreams as a serious testimony to yourself. What a difference there is between your dream
and mine! Mine tells how I was humbled and repressed; yours boasts over and over again
how you were praised. You cannot say, It matters nothing to me what another man dreamed,
for in those most enlightening books of yours you tell us that this was the motive which led
you to make the translation; you could not bear that an eminent man should have dreamed
in vain. This is all your endeavour. If you can make me out guilty of perjury, you think you
will be deemed no heretic.</p>

<p>33. I now come to the most serious charge of all, that in which you accuse me of having
been unfaithful after the restoration of our friendship. I confess that, of all the reproaches
which you bring against me or threaten me with, there is none which I would so much deprecate
as that of fraud, deceit and breach of faith. To sin is human, to lay snares is diabolical.
What! Was it for this that I joined hands with you over the slain lamb in the Church
of the Resurrection, that I might ‘steal your manuscripts at Rome’? or that I might ‘send out
my dogs to gnaw away your papers before they were corrected’? Can any one believe that
we made ready the accusers before you had committed the crime? Is it supposed that we
knew what plans you were meditating in your heart? or what another man had been
dreaming? or how the Greek proverb was having its fulfilment in your case, “the pig teaches
Minerva”? If I sent Eusebius to bark against you, who then stirred up the passion of Aterbius
and others against you? Is it not the fact that he thought that I also was a heretic because of
my friendship with you? And, when I had given him satisfaction as to the heresies of Origen,
you shut yourself up at home, and never dared to meet him, for fear you should have to
condemn what you wished not to condemn, or by openly resisting him should subject
yourself to the reproach of heresy. Do you think that he cannot be called as a witness against
you because he is your accuser? Before ever the reverend bishop Epiphanius came to Jerusalem,
and gave you the signs of peace by word and kiss, ‘yet having evil thoughts and guile
in his heart’; before I translated for him that letter3199 which was such a reproof to you, and
in which he wrote you down a heretic though he had before approved you as orthodox;
Aterbius was barking against you at Jerusalem, and, if he had not speedily taken himself off,
would have felt not your literary cudgel but the stick you flourish in your right hand to drive
the dogs away.3200</p>

<p>34. “But why,” you ask, “did you accept my manuscripts which had been falsified? and
why, when I had translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν did you dare to put your pen to the same work?
If I had erred, as any man may, ought you not to summon me to reply by a private letter,
and to speak smoothly to me, as I am speaking smoothly in my present letter?” My whole
fault is this that, when accusations were brought against me in the guise of disingenuous
praise, I tried to purge myself from them, and this without invidiously introducing your
name. I wished to refer to many persons a charge which you alone had brought, not so as
to retort the charge of heresy upon you, but to repel it from myself. Could I know that you
would be angry if I wrote against the heretics? You had said that you had taken away the
heretical passages from the works of Origen. I therefore turned my attacks not upon you
but upon the heretics, for I did not believe that you were a favourer of heresy. Pardon me,
if I did this with too great vehemence. I thought that I should give you pleasure. You say
that it was by the dishonest tricks of those who acted for me that your manuscripts were
brought out before the public, when they were kept secretly in your chamber, or were in
possession only of the man who had desired to have the translation made for him. But how
is this reconcilable with your former statement that either no one or very few had them? If
they were kept secret in your chamber, how could they be in the possession of the man who
had desired to have the translation made for him? If the one man for whom the manuscripts
had been written had obtained them in order to conceal them, then they were not kept secret
in your chamber, and they were not in the hands of those few who, as you now declare,
possessed them. You accuse us of having stolen them away; and then again you reproach
us with having bought them for a great sum of money and an immense bribe. In a single
matter, and in one little letter, what a tissue of various and discordant falsehoods! You have
full liberty for accusation, but I have none for defence. When you bring a charge, you think
nothing about friendship. When I begin to reply, then your mind is full of the rights of
friendship. Let me ask you: Did you write these manuscripts for concealment or for publication?
If for concealment, why were they written? If for publication, why did you conceal
them?</p>

<p>35. But my fault, you will say, was this, that I did not restrain your accusers who were
my friends. Why, I had enough to do to answer their accusations against myself; for they
charged me with hypocrisy,3201 as I could shew by producing their letters, because I kept
silence when I knew you to be a heretic; and because by incautiously maintaining peace
with you, I fostered the intestine wars of the Church. You call them my disciples; they suspect
me of being your fellow-disciple; and, because I was somewhat sparing in my rejection of
your praises, they think me to be initiated, along with you, into the mysteries of heresy. This
was the service your Prologue did me; you injured me more by appearing as my friend than
you would had you shewn yourself my enemy. They had persuaded themselves once for all
(whether rightly or wrongly is their business) that you were a heretic. If I should determine
to defend you, I should only succeed in getting myself accused by them along with you.
They cast in my teeth your laudation of me, which they suppose to have been written not
in craft but sincerity; and they vehemently reproach me with the very things which you always
praised in me. What am I to do? To turn my disciples into my accusers for your sake? To
receive on my own head the weapons which were hurled against my friend?</p>

<p>36. In the matter of the books Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, I have even a claim upon your gratitude.
You say that you cut off anything that was offensive and replaced it by what was better. I
have represented things just as they stood in the Greek. By this means both things are made
to appear, your faith and the heresy of him whom you translated. The leading Christians of
Rome wrote to me: Answer your accuser; if you keep silence, you will be held to have assented
to his charges. All of them unanimously demanded that I should bring to light the subtle
errors of Origen, and make known the poison of the heretics to the ears of the Romans to
put them on their guard. How can this be an injury to you? Have you a monopoly of the
translation of these books? Are there no others who take part in this work? When you
translated parts of the Septuagint, did you mean to prohibit all others from translating it
after your version had been published? Why, I also have translated many books from the
Greek. You have full power to make a second translation of them at your pleasure; for both
the good and the bad in them must be laid to the charge of their author. And this would
hold in your case also, had you not said that you had cut out the heretical parts and translated
only what was positively good. This is a difficulty which you have made for yourself, and
which cannot be solved, except by confessing that you have erred as all men err, and condemning
your former opinion.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37"> 
<pb n="1375"/>
<p>37. But what defence can you make in reference to the Apology which you have written
for the works of Origen, or rather in reference to the book of Eusebius, though you have
altered much, and translated the work of a heretic under the title of a martyr, yet you have
set down still more which is incompatible with the faith of the church. You as well as I turn
Latin books into Greek; can you prohibit me from giving the works of a foreigner to my
own people? If I had made my answer in the case of some other work of yours in which you
had not attacked me, it might have been thought that, in translating what you had already
translated, I was acting in hostility to you, and wishing to prove you inaccurate or untrustworthy.
But this is a new kind of complaint, when you take it amiss that an answer is made
you on a point on which you have accused me. All Rome was said to have been upset by
your translation; every one was demanding of me a remedy for this; not that I was of any
account, but that those who asked this thought me so. You say that you who had made the
translation were my friend. But what would you have had me do? Ought we to obey God
or man? To guard our master’s property or to conceal the theft of a fellow-servant? Can I
not be at peace with you unless I join with you in committing acts which bring reproach?
If you had not mentioned my name, if you had not tricked me out in your flatteries, I might
have had some way of escape, and have made many excuses for not translating what had
already been translated. But you, my friend, have compelled me to waste a good many days
on this work, and to bring out before the public eye what should have been engulfed in
Charybdis; yet still, though I had been injured, I observed the laws of friendship, and as far
as possible defended myself without accusing you. It is a too suspicious and complaining
temper which you shew when you take home to yourself as a reproach what was spoken
against the heretics. If it is impossible to be your friend unless I am the friend of heretics, I
shall more easily put up with your enmity than with their friendship.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">

<p>38. You imagine that I have contrived yet another piece of falsehood, namely, that I
have composed a letter to you in my own name, pretending that it was written long ago, in
which I make myself appear kindly and courteous; but which you never received. The truth
can easily be ascertained. Many persons at Rome have had copies of this letter for the last
three years; but they refused to send it to you knowing that you were throwing out insinuations
against my reputation, and making up stories of the most shameful kind and unworthy
of our Christian profession. I wrote in ignorance of all this, as to a friend; but they would
not transmit the letter to an enemy, such as they knew you to be, thus sparing me the effects
of my mistakes and you the reproaches of your conscience. You next bring arguments to
shew that, if I had written such a letter, I had no right to write another containing many
reproaches against you. But here is the error which pervades all that you say, and of which
I have a right to complain; whatever I say against the heretics you imagine to be said against
you. What! Am I refusing you bread because I give the heretics a stone to crush their brains?
But, in order to justify your disbelief in my letter, you are obliged to make out that of pope
Anastasius rests upon a similar fraud. On this point I have answered you before. If you really
suspect that it is not his writing, you have the means of convicting me of the forgery. But if
it is his writing, as his letters of the present year also written against you prove, you will in
vain use your false reasonings to prove my letter false, since I can shew from his genuine
letter that mine also is genuine.</p>

<p>39. In order to parry the charge of falsehood, it is your humour to become quite exacting.
You are not to be called to produce the six thousand books of Origen, of which you speak;
but you expect me to be acquainted with all the records of Pythagoras. What truth is there
in all the boastful language, which you blurted out from your inflated cheeks, declaring that
you had corrected the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν by introducing words which you had read in other books
of Origen, and thus had not put in other men’s words but restored his own? Out of all this
forest of his works you cannot produce a single bush or sucker. You accuse me of raising
up smoke and mist. Here you have smoke and mist indeed. You know that I have dissipated
and done away with them; but, though your neck is broken, you do not bow it down, but,
with an impudence which exceeds even your ignorance, you say that I am denying what is
quite evident, so as to excuse yourself, after promising mountains of gold, for not producing
even a leatherlike farthing from your treasury. I acknowledge that your animosity against
me rests on good grounds, and that your rage and passion is genuine; for, unless I made
persistent demands for what does not exist, you would be thought to have what you have
not. You ask me for the books of Pythagoras. But who has informed you that any books of
his are extant? It is true that in my letter which you criticize these words occur: “Suppose
that I erred in youth, and that, having been trained in profane literature, I at the beginning
of my Christian course had no sufficient doctrinal knowledge, and that I attributed to the
Apostles things which I had read in Pythagoras or Plato or Empedocles;” but I was speaking
not of their books but of their tenets, with which I was able to acquaint myself through
Cicero, Brutus, and Seneca. Read the short oration for3202 Vatinius, and others in which
mention is made of secret societies. Turn over Cicero’s dialogues. Search through the coast
of Italy which used to be called Magna Græcia, and you will find there various doctrines of
Pythagoras inscribed on brass on their public monuments. Whose are those Golden Rules?
They are Pythagoras’s; and in these all his principles are contained in a summary form.
Iamblicus3203 wrote a commentary upon them, following in this, at least partly, Moderatus
a man of great eloquence, and Archippus and Lysides who were disciples of Pythagoras. Of
these, Archippus and Lysides held schools in Greece, that is, in Thebes; they retained so
fully the precepts of their teacher, that they made use of their memory instead of books.
One of these precepts is: “We must cast away by any contrivance, and cut out by fire and
sword and contrivances of all kinds, disease from the body, ignorance from the soul, luxury
from the belly, sedition from the state, discord from the family, excess from all things
alike.”3204 There are other precepts of Pythagoras, such as these. “Friends have all things in
common.” “A friend is a second self.” “Two moments are specially to be observed, morning

and evening: that is, things which we are going to do, and things which we have done.”
“Next to God we must worship truth, for this alone makes men akin to God.” There are also
enigmas which Aristotle has collated with much diligence in his works: “Never go beyond
the Stater,” that is, “Do not transgress the rule of justice;” “Never stir the fire with the sword,”
that is, “Do not provoke a man when he is angry and excited with hard words.” “We must
not touch the crown,” that is “We must maintain the laws of the state.” “Do not eat out your
heart,” that is, “Cast away sorrow from your mind.” “When you have started, do not return,”
that is, “After death do not regret this life.” “Do not walk on the public road,” that is, “Do
not follow the errors of the multitude.” “Never admit a swallow into the family,” that is, “Do
not admit chatterers and talkative persons under the same roof with you.” “Put fresh burdens
on the burdened; put none on those who lay them down;” that is, “When men are on the
road to virtue, ply them with fresh precepts; when they abandon themselves to idleness,
leave them alone.” I said I had read the doctrines of the Pythagoreans. Let me tell you that
Pythagoras was the first to discover the immortality of the soul and its transmigration from
one body to another. To this view Virgil gives his adherence in the sixth book of the Æneid
in these words:3205
<lg>
<l>These, when the wheel full thousand years has turned,</l>
<l>God calls, a long sad line, in Lethe’s stream</l>
<l>To drown the past, and long once more to see</l>
<l>The skies above, and to the flesh return.</l>
</lg>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">     
<pb n="1379"/>
<p>40. Pythagoras taught, accordingly, that he had himself been originally Euphorbus, and
then Callides, thirdly Hermotimus, fourthly Pyrrhus, and lastly Pythagoras; and that those
things which had existed, after certain revolutions of time, came into being again; so that
nothing in the world should be thought of as new. He said that true philosophy was a meditation
on death; that its daily struggle was to draw forth the soul from the prison of the
body into liberty: that our learning was recollection, and many other things which Plato
works out in his dialogues, especially in the Phædo and Timæus. For Plato, after having
formed the Academy and gained innumerable disciples, felt that his philosophy was deficient
on many points, and therefore went to Magna Græcia, and there learned the doctrines of
Pythagoras from Archytas of Tarentum and Timæus of Locris: and this system he embodied
in the elegant form and style which he had learned from Socrates. The whole of this, as we
can prove, Origen carried over into his book Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, only changing the name. What
mistake, then, was I making, when I said that in my youth I had imputed to the Apostles
ideas which I had found in Pythagoras, Plato and Empedocles? I did not speak, as you
calumniously pretend, of what I had read in the books of Pythagoras, Plato and Empedocles,
but of what I had read as having existed in their writings, that is, what other men’s writings
shewed me to have existed in them. This mode of speaking is quite common. I might say,
for instance “The opinions which I read in Socrates I believed to be true,” meaning what I
read as his opinions in Plato and others of the Socratic school, though Socrates himself
wrote no books. So I might say, I wished to imitate the deeds which I had read of in Alexander
and Scipio,3206 not meaning that they described their own deeds, but that I had read in
other men’s works of the deeds which I admired as done by them. Therefore, though I may
not be able to inform you of any records of Pythagoras himself as being extant, and proved
by the attestation of his son or daughter or others of his disciples, yet you cannot hold me
guilty of falsehood, because I said not that I had read his books, but his doctrines. You are
quite mistaken if you thought to make this a screen for your falsehood, and to maintain that
because I cannot produce any book written by Pythagoras, you have a right to assert that
six thousand books of Origen have been lost.</p>

writing when you are a man of extreme gentleness and of a meekness worthy of Moses. You
declare that you are aware of crimes which I confessed to you alone when you were my most

like yours, or rather fury and madness, to keep up things false and true alike, till I was
ashamed to speak and you to hear: and to upbraid you in such a way as would condemn
either the accused or the accuser; to force myself on the reader by mere effrontery, make
him believe that what I wrote unscrupulously I wrote truly. But far be it from the practice
of Christians while offering up their lives to seek the life of others, and to become homicides
not with the sword but the will. This may agree with your gentleness and innocence; for
you can draw forth from the dung heap within your breast alike the odour of roses and the
stench of corpses; and, contrary to the precept of the Prophet, call that bitter which once
you had praised as sweet. But it is not necessary for us, in treating of Christian topics, to
throw out accusations which ought to be brought before the law courts. You shall hear
nothing more from me than the vulgar saying: “When you have said what you like, you shall
bear what you do not like.” Or if the coarse proverb seems to you too vulgar, and, being a
man of culture, you prefer the words of philosophers or poets, take from me the words of
Homer.3207</p>
<p>“What words thou speakest, thou the like shalt hear.”</p>
<p>One thing I should like to learn from one of such eminent sanctity and fastidiousness,
(whose holiness is such that in the presence of your very handkerchiefs and aprons the
devils cry out); whom do you take for your model in your writings? Has any one of the
catholic writers, in a controversy of opinions, imputed moral offences to the man with whom
he is arguing? Have your masters taught you to do this? Is this the system in which you have
been trained, that, when you cannot answer a man, you should take off his head? that when
you cannot silence a man’s tongue, you should cut it out? You have nothing much to boast
of, for you are doing only what the scorpions and cantharides do. This is what Fulvia3208
did to Cicero and Herodias to John. They could not bear to hear the truth, and therefore
they pierced the tongue that spoke truth with the pin that parted their hair. The duty of
dogs is to bark in their masters’ service; why may I not bark in the service of Christ? Many
have written against Marcion or Valentinus, Arius or Eunomius. By which of them was any
accusation brought of immoral conduct? Did they not in each case bring their whole effort
to bear upon the refutation of the heresy? It is the machination of the heretics, that is of
your masters, when convicted of betrayal of the faith, to betake themselves to evil speaking.

So Eustathius3209 the Bishop of Antioch was made into a father unawares. So Athanasius
Bishop of Alexandria cut off a third hand of Arsenius; for, when he appeared3210 alive after
having been supposed to be dead, he was found to have two. Such things also now are falsely
charged against the Bishop of the same church, and the true faith is assailed by gold, which
constitutes the power of yourself and your friends. But I need not speak of controversy with
heretics, who, though they are really without, yet call themselves Christians. How many of
our writers have contended with those most impious men, Celsus and Porphyry! but which
of them has left the cause he was engaged in to busy himself with the imputation of crime
to his adversary, such as ought to be set down not in church-writings but in the calendar of
the judge? For what advantage have you gained if you establish a man’s criminality but fail
in your argument? It is quite unnecessary that in bringing an accusation you should risk
your own head. If your object is revenge, you can hire an executioner, and satisfy your desire.
You pretend to dread a scandal, and yet you are ready to kill a man who was once your
brother, whom you now accuse, and whom you always treat as an enemy. Yet I wonder how
a man like you, who knows what he is about, should be so blinded by madness as to wish
to confer a benefit upon me by drawing forth my soul out of prison,3211 and should not
suffer it to remain with you in the darkness of this world.</p>

<p>43. If you wish me to keep silence, cease from accusing me. Lay down your sword, and
I will throw away my shield. To one thing only I cannot consent; that is, to spare the heretics,
and not to vindicate my orthodoxy. If that is the cause of discord between us, I can submit
to death, but not to silence. It would have been right to go through the whole of the Scriptures
for answers to your ravings, and, like David playing on his harp, to take the divine words
to calm your raging breast. But I will content myself with a few statements from a single
book; I will oppose Wisdom to folly; for I hope if you despise the words of men you will not
think lightly of the word of God. Listen, then, to that which Solomon the wise says about
you and all who are addicted to evil speaking and contumely:</p>
<p>“Foolish men, while they desire injuries, become impious and hate wisdom.3212 Devise
not evil against thy friend. Be not angry with a man without a cause. The impious exalt
contumely. 3213Remove from thee the evil mouth, keep far from thee the wicked lips, the
eyes of him that speaketh evil, the tongue of the unjust, the hands which shed the blood of
the just,3214 the heart that deviseth evil thoughts, and the feet which hasten to do evil. He
that resteth upon falsehood feedeth the winds, and followeth the flying birds. For he hath
left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath made the wheels of his tillage to err. He walketh
through the dry and desert places, and with his hands he gathereth barrenness.3215 The
mouth of the froward is near to destruction, and 3216he who uttereth evil words is the chief
of fools. Every simple man is a soul that is blessed; but a violent man is dishonourable. 3217By
the fault of his lips the sinner falleth into a snare. 3218All the ways of a fool are right in his
own eyes. 3219The fool showeth his anger on that very day. 3220Lying lips are an abomination
to the Lord. 3221He that keepeth his lips guardeth his own soul; but he that is rash with his
lips shall be a terror to himself. 3222The evil man in his violence doeth evil things, and the
fool spreadeth out his folly. 3223Seek for wisdom among the evil and thou shalt not find it.

3224The rash man shall eat of the fruit of his own ways. 3225The wise man by taking heed
avoideth the evil; but the fool is confident, and joins himself to it. 3226A long-suffering man
is strong in his wisdom; the man of little mind is very unwise. 3227He who oppresseth the
poor reproacheth his Maker. 3228The tongue of the wise knoweth good things, but the mouth
of fools speaketh evil. 3229A quarrelsome man preferreth strife, and every one that lifteth
up his heart is unclean before God. 3230Though hand join with hand unjustly, they shall
not be unpunished. 3231He that loveth life must be sparing to his mouth. 3232Insolence
goeth before bruising, and evil thoughts before a fall. 3233He who closeth his eyes speaketh
perverse things, and provoketh all evil with his lips. 3234The lips of a fool lead him into evil,
and the foolhardy speech calleth down death. The man of evil counsel shall suffer much
loss. 3235Better is a poor man who is just than a rich man that speaketh lies. 3236It is a glory
to a man to turn away from evil words; but he that is foolish bindeth himself therewith.
3237Love not detraction, lest thou be rooted out. 3238The bread of lying is sweet to a man,
but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 3239He that gaineth treasures with a lying
tongue followeth vanity, and shall come into the snares of death. 3240Say thou nought in
the ear of a fool, lest haply the wise mock at thy words. 3241The bludgeon and the sword
and the arrow are hurtful things; 3242so is the man who beareth false witness against his
friend. 3243As the birds and the sparrows fly away, so the curse shall be vain and shall not

become like unto him; but answer a fool according to his folly, lest he appear to himself to
be wise. 3245He who layeth wait for his friends when he is discovered saith, I did it in sport.
3246A faggot for the coals, and wood for the fire, and a man of evil words for the tumult of
strife. 3247If thine enemy ask thee aught, sparingly but with a loud voice, 3248consent thou
not to him, for there are seven degrees of wickedness in his heart. 3249The stone is heavy,
and the sand hard to be borne; but the anger of a fool is heavier than either; indignation is
cruel, anger is sharp, and envy is impatient. 3250The impious man speaketh against the poor;
and he that trusteth in the audacity of his heart is most foolish. 3251The unwise man putteth
forth all his anger, but the wise dealeth it out in parts. 3252An evil son—his teeth are swords,
and his grinders are as harrows, to consume the weak from off the earth, and the poor from
among men.”</p>

have spoken lies. Their madness is like the madness of the serpent; like the deaf adder which
stoppeth her ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers, and of the magician wisely
enchanting. God shall break their teeth in their mouth; the Lord shall break the great teeth
of the lions. They shall come to nothing, like water that runneth away. He bendeth his bow
until they be brought low. Like wax that melteth, they shall be carried away; the fire hath
fallen upon them and they have not seen the sun.”</p>

<head>A Commentary on the Apostles’ Creed.</head>
<p>This exposition of the Creed was made at the request of Laurentius, a Bishop whose see
is unknown, but is conjectured by Fontanini, in his life of Rufinus, to have been Concordia,
Rufinus’ birthplace.</p>
<p>Its exact date cannot be fixed; but from the fact that he says nothing of his difficulty in
writing Latin after being so long in the East, as he does in several of his books, and from the
comparative ease of the style, it is most probable that it was written in the later years of his
sojourn at Aquileia, that is, about 307–309.</p>
<p>Its value is considerable (1) as bearing witness to the state of the Creed in local churches
at the beginning of the 5th century, especially their variations. (In the church of Aquileia,
in Jesu Christo. Patrem invisibilem et impassibilem. Resurrectio hujus carnis); (2) as showing
the adaptation of Eastern ideas to the formation of Western theology; (3) as giving the
Canon of the books of Scripture, and the Apocrypha of both the Old and New dispensations.</p>
<p>The exposition is clear and reasonable; and, with the exception of a very few passages,
such as the argument from the Phoenix for the Virgin Birth of our Lord, is still of use to us.</p>
<p>We prefix the words of the creed on which Rufinus makes his commentary.</p>
<p>It seems desirable to give the original Latin, as well as the English version of the Creed
of Aquileia. The words or letters which are peculiar to this creed are put in italics.</p>

<p>My mind has as little inclination for writing as sufficiency, most faithful Bishop(Papa)
Laurentius,3255 for I well know that it is a matter of no little peril to submit a slender ability
to general criticism. But, since in your letter you rashly (forgive my saying so) require me,
by Christ’s sacraments, which I hold in the greatest reverence, to compose something for
you concerning the Faith, in accordance with the traditional and natural meaning of the
Creed, although in so doing you impose a burthen upon me beyond my strength to bear
(for I do not forget the opinion of the wise, which so justly says, that “to speak of God even
what is true is perilous”); still, if you will aid with your prayers the necessity which your requisition
has laid upon me, I will try to say something, moved rather by a reverential regard
for your injunction than by presumptuous confidence in my ability. What I write, however,
will hardly seem worthy of the consideration of persons of mature understanding, but suited
rather to the capacity of children and young beginners in Christ.</p>
<p>I find, indeed, that some eminent writers have published treatises on these matters piously
and briefly written. Moreover, I know that the heretic Photinus has written on the same;
but with the object, not of explaining the meaning of the text to his readers, but of wresting
things simply and truthfully said in support of his own dogma, while yet the Holy Spirit has
taken care that in these words nothing should be set down which is ambiguous or obscure,
or inconsistent with other truths: for therein is that prophecy verified, “Finishing and cutting
short the word in equity: because a short word will the Lord make upon the earth.”3256 It
shall be our endeavour, then, first to restore and emphasize the words of the Apostles in
their native simplicity; and, secondly, to supply such things as seem to have been omitted
by former expositors. But that the scope of this “short word,” as we have called it, may be
made more plain, we will enquire from the beginning how it came to be given to the
Churches.</p>
<note type="footnote">3255 Nothing is known of this Pope Laurentius. The title “Papa,” at first given to Bishops promiscuously, was
not yet restricted to the Bishop of Rome. Gregory VII., in a Council held at Rome in 1073, forbade it to be given
to any other.</note>

<p>2. Our forefathers have handed down to us the tradition, that, after the Lord’s ascension,
when, through the coming of the Holy Ghost, tongues of flame had settled upon each of the
Apostles, that they might speak diverse languages, so that no race however foreign, no tongue
however barbarous, might be inaccessible to them and beyond their reach, they were commanded
by the Lord to go severally to the several nations to preach the word of God. Being
on the eve therefore of departing from one another, they first mutually agreed upon a
standard of their future preaching, lest haply, when separated, they might in any instance
vary in the statements which they should make to those whom they should invite to believe
in Christ. Being all therefore met together, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, they composed,
as we have said, this brief formulary of their future preaching, each contributing his
several sentence to one common summary: and they ordained that the rule thus framed
should be given to those who believe.</p>
<p>To this formulary, for many and most sufficient reasons, they gave the name or Symbol.
For Symbol (κύμβολον) in Greek answers to both “Indicium” (a sign or token) and “Collatio”
(a joint contribution made by several) in Latin. For this the Apostles did in these words,
each contributing his several sentence. It is called “Indicium” or “Signum,” a sign or token,
because, at that time, as the Apostle Paul says, and as is related in the Acts of the Apostles,
many of the vagabond Jews, pretending to be apostles of Christ, went about preaching for
gain’s sake or their belly’s sake, naming the name of Christ indeed, but not delivering their
message according to the exact traditional lines. The Apostles therefore prescribed this
formulary as a sign or token by which he who preached Christ truly, according to Apostolic
rule, might be recognised. Finally, they say that in civil wars, since the armour of both sides
is alike, and the language the same, and the custom and mode of warfare the same, each
general, to guard against treachery, is wont to deliver to his soldiers a distinct symbol or
watchword—in Latin “signum” or “indicium”—so that if one is met with, of whom it is
doubtful to which side he belongs, being asked the symbol (watchword), he discloses
whether he is friend or foe. And for this reason, the tradition continues, the Creed is not
written on paper or parchment, but is retained in the hearts of the faithful, that it may be
certain that no one has learnt it by reading, as is sometimes the case with unbelievers, but
by tradition from the Apostles.</p>
<p>The Apostles therefore, as we have said, being about to separate in order to preach the
Gospel, settled upon this sign or token of their agreement in the faith; and, unlike the sons
of Noah, who, when they were about to separate from one another, builded a tower of baked
bricks and pitch, whose top might reach to heaven, they raised a monument of faith, which
might withstand the enemy, composed of living stones and pearls of the Lord, such that
neither winds might overthrow it, nor floods undermine it, nor the force of storms and
tempests shake it. Right justly, then, were the former, when, on the eve of separation, they
builded a tower of pride, condemned to the confusion of tongues, so that no one might

<pb n="1392"/>
understand his neighbour’s speech; while the latter, who were building a tower of faith, were
endowed with the knowledge and understanding of all languages; so that the one might
prove a sign and token of sin, the other of faith.</p>
<p>But it is time now that we should say something about these same pearls, among which
is placed first the fountain and source of all, when it is said,—</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">    
<pb n="1393"/>
<p>3. I Believe in God the Father Almighty.</p>
<p>But before I begin to discuss the meaning of the words, I think it well to mention that
in different Churches some additions are found in this article. This is not the case, however,
in the Church of the city of Rome; the reason being, as I suppose, that, on the one hand, no
heresy has had its origin there, and, on the other, that the ancient custom is there kept up,
that those who are going to be baptized should rehearse the Creed publicly, that is, in the
audience of the people; the consequence of which is that the ears of those who are already
believers will not admit the addition of a single word. But in other places, as I understand,
additions appear to have been made, on account of certain heretics, by means of which it
was hoped that novelty in doctrine would be excluded. We, however, follow that order which
we received when we were baptized in the Church of Aquileia.</p>
<p>I Believe, therefore, is placed in the forefront, as the Apostle Paul, writing to the Hebrews,
says, “He that cometh to God must first of all believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder
of those who believe on Him.”3257 The Prophet also says, “Except ye believe,3258 ye shall
not understand.” That the way to understand, therefore, may be open to you, you do rightly
first of all, in professing that you believe; for no one embarks upon the sea, and trusts himself
to the deep and liquid element, unless he first believes it possible that he will have a safe
voyage; neither does the husbandman commit his seed to the furrows and scatter his grain
on the earth, but in the belief that the showers will come, together with the sun’s warmth,
through whose fostering influence, aided by favouring winds, the earth will produce and
multiply and ripen its fruits. In fine, nothing in life can be transacted if there be not first a
readiness to believe. What wonder then, if, coming to God, we first of all profess that we
believe, seeing that, without this, not even common life can be lived. We have premised
these remarks at the outset, since the Pagans are wont to object to us that our religion, because
it lacks reasons, rests solely on belief. We have shewn, therefore, that nothing can possibly
be done or remain stable unless belief precede. Finally, marriages are contracted in the belief
that children will be born; and children are committed to the care of masters in the belief
that the teaching of the masters will be transferred to the pupils; and one man assumes the
ensigns of empire, believing that peoples and cities and a well-equipped army also will obey
him. But if no one enters upon any one of these several undertakings except in the belief
that the results spoken of will follow, must not belief be much more requisite if one would
come to the knowledge of God? But let us see what this “short word” of the Creed sets forth.</p>

<p>4. “I Believe in God the Father Almighty.”</p>
<p>The Eastern Churches almost universally deliver the article thus, “I believe in One God
the Father Almighty;” and again in the next article, where we say, “And in Christ Jesus, His
only Son, our Lord,” they deliver it., “And in One (Lord) our Lord Jesus Christ, His only
Son;” confessing, that is, “one God,” and “one Lord,” in accordance with the authority of
the Apostle Paul. But we shall return to this by-and-by. For the present, let us turn our attention
to the words, “In God the Father Almighty.”</p>
<p>“God,” so far as the human mind can form an idea, is the name of that nature or substance
which is above all things. “Father” is a word expressive of a secret and ineffable
mystery. When you hear the word “God,” you must understand thereby a substance without
beginning, without end, simple, uncompounded, invisible, incorporeal, ineffable, inappreciable,
which has in it nothing which has been either added or created. For He is without
cause who is absolutely the cause of all things. When you hear the word “Father,” you must
understand by this the Father of a Son, which Son is the image of the aforesaid substance.
For as no one is called “Lord” unless he have a possession or a servant whose lord he is, and
as no one is called “master” unless he have a disciple, so no one can possibly be called
“father” unless he have a son. This very name of “Father,” therefore, shews plainly that, together
with the Father there subsists a Son also.</p>
<p>But I would not have you discuss how God the Father begat the Son, nor intrude too
curiously into the profound mystery, lest haply, by prying too eagerly into the brightness
of light inaccessible, you should lose the faint glimpse which, by the gift of God, has been
vouchsafed to mortals. Or, if you suppose that this is a subject to be investigated with all
possible scrutiny, first propose to yourself questions which concern ourselves, and then, if
you are able to deal satisfactorily with them, speed on from earthly things to heavenly, from
visible to invisible. Determine first, if you can, how the mind, which is within you, generates
a word, and what is the spirit of the memory which is in it; and how these, though diverse
in reality and in operation, are yet one in substance or nature; and though they proceed
from the mind, yet are never separated from it. And if these, though they are in us and in
the substance of our own soul, yet seem to be hidden from us in proportion as they are invisible
to our bodily sight, let us take for our enquiry things which are more open to view.
How does a spring generate a river from itself? By what spirit is it borne into a rapidly
flowing stream? How happens it that, while the river and the spring are one and inseparable,
yet neither can the river be understood to be, or can be called, the spring, nor the spring the
river, and yet he who has seen the river has seen the spring also? Exercise yourself first in
explaining these, and explain, if you are able, things which you have under your hands; and
then you may come to loftier matters. Do not think, however, that I would have you ascend
all at once from the earth above the heavens: I would first, with your leave, draw your attention
to this firmament which our eyes behold, and ask you to explain, if you can, the nature

<pb n="1395"/>
of this visible luminary,—how that celestial fire generates from itself the brightness of light,
how it also produces heat; and though these are three in reality, how they are yet one in
substance. And if you are capable of investigating each of these, even then you must acknowledge
that the mystery of the Divine generation is by so much the more diverse and the more
transcendent as the Creator is more powerful than the creatures, as the artificer is more
excellent than his work, as He who ever is more noble than that which had its beginning
out of nothing.</p>
<p>That God then is the Father of His only Son our Lord is to be believed, not discussed;
for it is not lawful for a servant to dispute about the nativity of his lord. The Father hath
borne witness from heaven, saying,3259 “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased:
hear Him.” The Father saith that He is His Son and bids us hear Him. The Son saith, “He
who seeth Me seeth the Father also,”3260 and “I and the Father are one,”3261 and “I came
forth from God and am come into the world.”3262 Where is the man who can thrust himself
as a disputant between these words of Father and Son, who can divide the Godhead, separate
its volition, break asunder the substance, cut the spirit in parts, and deny that what the Truth
speaks is true? God then is a true Father as the Father of the Truth, not begetting extrinsically,
but generating the Son from that which Himself is; that is, as the All-wise He generates
Wisdom, as the Just Justice, as the Everlasting the Everlasting, as the Immortal Immortality,
as the Invisible the Invisible; because He is Light, He generates Brightness, because He is
Mind, He generates the Word.</p>

<p>5. Now whereas we said that the Eastern Churches, in their delivery of the Creed, say,
“In one God3263 the Father Almighty,” and “in one Lord,” the “one” is not to be understood
numerically but absolutely. For example, if one should say, “one man” or “one horse,” here
“one” is used numerically. For there may be a second man and a third, or a second horse
and a third. But where a second or a third cannot be added, if we say “one” we mean one
not numerically but absolutely. For example, if we say, “one Sun,” here the meaning is that
a second or a third cannot be added, for there is but one Sun. Much more then is God, when
He is said to be “one,” called “one,” not numerically but absolutely, that is, He is therefore
said to be one because there is no other. In like manner, also, it is to be understood of the
Lord, that He is one Lord, Jesus Christ, by or through Whom God the Father possesses
dominion over all, whence also, in the next clause, God is called “Almighty.”</p>
<p>God is called Almighty because He possesses rule and dominion over all things.3264 But
the Father possesses all things by His Son, as the Apostle says, “By Him were created all
things, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers.”3265 And again, writing to the Hebrews, he says, “By Him also He made the worlds,”
and “He appointed Him heir of all things.”3266 By “appointed” we are to understand “generated.”
Now if the Father made the worlds by Him, and all things were created by Him,
and He is heir of all things, then by Him He possesses rule also over all things. Because, as
light is born of light, and truth of truth, so Almighty is born of Almighty. As it is written of
the Seraphim in the Revelation of John, “And they have no rest day and night, crying Holy,
Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth, which was and which is and which is to come, the
Almighty.”3267 He then who “is to come” is called “Almighty.” And what other is there who
“is to come” but Christ, the Son of God?</p>
<p>To the foregoing is added “Invisible and Impassible.” I should mention that these two
words are not in the Creed of the Roman Church. They were added in our Church, as is
well known, on account of the Sabellian heresy, called by us “the Patripassian,” that, namely,
which says that the Father Himself was born of the Virgin and became visible, or affirms
that He suffered in the flesh. To exclude such impiety, therefore, concerning the Father, our
forefathers seem to have added these words, calling the Father “invisible and impassible.”
For it is evident that the Son, not the Father, became incarnate and was born in the flesh,
<note type="footnote">3263 Deum,not, as before, Deo.</note>
<note type="footnote">3264 Compare Cyril’s words, Quod omnium teneat potentatum—Lordship over all; ὁ παντοκράτωρ, ὁ πάντων
κρατων, ὁ πάντων ἐξουσιάζων. (Catech., 8, §3). Rufinus evidently had St. Cyril’s exposition in view here as repeatedly

and that from that nativity in the flesh the Son became “visible and passible.” Yet so far as
regards that immortal substance of the Godhead, which He possesses, and which is one and
the same with that of the Father, we must believe that neither the Father, nor the Son, nor
the Holy Ghost is “visible or passible.” But the Son, in that He condescended to assume
flesh, was both seen and also suffered in the flesh. Which also the Prophet foretold when
he said, “This is our God: no other shall be accounted of in comparison of Him. He hath
found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel
His beloved. Afterward He shewed Himself upon the earth, and conversed with men.”3268</p>

<p>6. Next there follows, “And in Christ Jesus, His Only Son, Our Lord.” “Jesus” is a Hebrew
word meaning “Saviour.” “Christ” is so called from “Chrism,” i.e. unction. For we read in
the Books of Moses, that Auses, the son of Nave,3269 when he was chosen to lead the people,
had his name changed from “Auses” to “Jesus,” to shew that this was a name proper for
princes and generals, for those, namely, who should “save” the people who followed them.
Therefore, both were called “Jesus,” both the one who conducted the people, who had been
brought forth out of the land of Egypt, and freed from the wanderings of the wilderness,
into the land of promise, and the other, who conducted the people, who had been brought
forth from the darkness of ignorance, and recalled from the errors of the world, into the
kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>“Christ” is a name proper either to High Priests or Kings. For formerly both high priests
and kings were consecrated with the ointment of chrism: but these, as mortal and corruptible,
with material and corruptible ointment. Jesus is made Christ, being anointed with the Holy
Spirit, as the Scripture saith of Him “Whom the Father hath anointed with the Holy Spirit
sent down from heaven.”3270 And Isaiah had prefigured the same, saying in the person of
the Son, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me, He hath sent
Me to preach good tidings to the poor.”3271</p>
<p>Having shewn them what “Jesus” is, Who saves His people, and what “Christ” is, Who
is made a High Priest for ever, let us now see in what follows, of Whom these things are
said, “His only Son, our Lord.” Here we are taught that this Jesus, of whom we have spoken,
and this Christ, the meaning of whose name we have expounded, is “the only Son of God”
and “our Lord.” Lest, perchance, you should think that these human names have an earthly
significance, therefore it is added that He is “the only Son of God, our Lord.” For He is born
One of One, because there is one brightness of light, and there is one word of the understanding.
Neither does an incorporeal generation degenerate into the plural number, or suffer
division, where He Who is born is in no wise separated from Him Who begets. He is “only”
(unique), as thought is to the mind, as wisdom is to the wise, as a word is to the understanding,
as valour is to the brave. For as the Father is said by the Apostle to be “alone wise,”3272
so likewise the Son alone is called wisdom. He is then the “only Son.” And, although in
glory, everlastingness, virtue, dominion, power, He is what the Father is, yet all these He
hath not unoriginately as the Father, but from the Father, as the Son, without beginning
and equal; and although He is the Head of all things, yet the Father is the Head of Him. For
so it is written, “The Head of Christ is God.”3273</p>

<p>7. When you hear the word “Son,” you must not think of a nativity after the flesh; but
remember that it is spoken of an incorporeal substance, and a simple and uncompounded
nature. For if, as we said above, whether when the understanding generates a word, or the
mind sense, or light brings forth brightness from itself, nothing of this sort is sought for, or
any manner of weakness and imperfection imagined in this kind of generation, how much
purer and more sacred ought to be our conception of the Creator of all these!</p>
<p>But perhaps you say, “The generation of which you speak is an unsubstantial generation.
For light does not produce substantial brightness, nor the understanding generate a substantial
word, but the Son of God, it is affirmed, was generated substantially.” To this we reply,
first, When in other things examples or illustrations are used, the resemblance cannot hold
in every particular, but only in some one point for which the illustration is employed. For
instance, When it is said in the Gospel, “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman
hid in three measures of meal,”3274 are we to imagine that the kingdom of heaven is in all
respects like leaven, so that like leaven it is palpable and perishable so as to become sour
and unfit for use? Obviously the illustration was employed simply for this object—to shew
how, through the preaching of God’s word which seems so small a thing, men’s minds could
be imbued with the leaven of faith. So likewise, when it is said, “The kingdom of heaven is
like unto a net cast into the sea, which draws in fishes of every kind,”3275 are we to suppose
that the substance of the kingdom of heaven is likened in all respects to the nature of twine
of which a net is made, and to the knots with which the meshes are tied? No; the sole object
of the comparison is to shew that, as a net brings fishes to the shore from the depths of the
sea, so by the preaching of the kingdom of heaven men’s souls are liberated from the depth
of the error of this world. From whence it is evident that examples or illustrations do not
answer in every particular to the things which they are brought to exemplify or illustrate.
Otherwise, if they were the same in all respects, they would no longer be called examples or
illustrations, but rather would be the things themselves.</p>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">    
<pb n="1400"/>
<p>8. Then further it is to be observed that no creature can be such as its Creator. And
therefore, as the divine substance or essence admits of no comparison, so neither does the
Divinity. Moreover, every creature is of nothing. If therefore a spark which is so unsubstantial
but yet is fire, begets of itself a creature which is of nothing, and maintains in it the essential
nature of that from which it springs, (i.e. the fire of the parent spark), why could not the
substance of that eternal Light which ever has been because it has in itself nothing which is
not substantial, produce from itself substantial brightness? Rightly, therefore, is the Son
called “only,” “unique.” For He who hath been so born is “only” and “unique.” That which
is unique can admit of no comparison. Nor can He who made all things be like in substance
to the things which He has made. This then is Christ Jesus, the only Son of God, who is also
our Lord. “Only” may be referred both to Son and to Lord. For Jesus Christ is “only” both
as truly Son and as one Lord. For all other sons, though they are called sons, are so called
by the grace of adoption, not by verity of nature; and if there be others who are called lords,
they are called so from an authority bestowed not inherent. But Christ alone is the only Son
and the only Lord, as the Apostle saith, “One Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things.”3276
Therefore, after the Creed has in due order set forth the ineffable mystery of the nativity of
the Son from the Father, it now descends to the dispensation which He vouchsafed to enter
upon for man’s salvation. And of Him whom just now it called the “only Son of God” and
“our Lord,” it now says.</p>

<p>9. “Who Was Born by (de) The Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary.” This nativity among
men is in the way of dispensation,3277 whereas the former nativity is of the divine substance;
the one results from his condescension, the other from his essential nature. He is born by
the Holy Ghost of the Virgin. Here a chaste ear and a pure mind is required. For you must
understand that now a temple hath been built within the secret recesses of a Virgin’s womb
for Him of Whom erewhile you learnt that He was born ineffably of the Father. And just as
in the sanctification of the Holy Ghost no thought of imperfection is to be admitted, so in
the Virgin-birth no defilement is to be imagined. For this birth was a new birth given to this
world, and rightly new. For He Who is the only Son in heaven is by consequence the only
Son on earth, and was uniquely born, born as no other ever was or can be.</p>
<p>The words of the Prophets concerning Him, “A Virgin shall conceive and bring forth
a Son,”3278 are known to all, and are cited in the Gospels again and again. The Prophet
Ezekiel too had predicted the miraculous manner of that birth, calling Mary figuratively
“the Gate of the Lord,” the gate, namely, through which the Lord entered the world. For he
saith, “The gate which looks towards the East shall be closed, and shall not be opened, and
no one shall pass through it, because the Lord God of Israel shall pass through it, and it shall
be closed.”3279 What could be said with such evident reference to the inviolate preservation
of the Virgin’s condition? That Gate of Virginity was closed; through it the Lord God of Israel
entered; through it He came forth from the Virgin’s womb into this world; and the Virginstate
being preserved inviolate, the gate of the Virgin remained closed for ever. Therefore
the Holy Ghost is spoken of as the Creator of the Lord’s flesh and of His temple.</p>

<p>10. Starting from this point you may understand the majesty of the Holy Ghost also.
For the Gospel witnesses of Him that when the angel said to the Virgin, “Thou shalt bring
forth a Son and shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins,”3280
she replied, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” on which the angel said to her,
“The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.
Wherefore that holy Thing which shall be born of Thee shall be called the Son of God.”3281
See here the Trinity mutually cooperating with each other. The Holy Ghost is spoken of as
coming upon the Virgin, and the Power of the Highest as overshadowing her. What is the
Power of the Highest but Christ Himself, Who is the Power of God and the Wisdom of
God? Whose is this Power? The Power of the Highest. There is here then the Highest, there
is also the Power of the Highest, there is also the Holy Ghost. This is the Trinity, everywhere
latent, and everywhere apparent, distinct in names and persons, but inseparable in the
substance of the Godhead. And although the Son alone is born of the Virgin, yet there is
present also the Highest, there is present also the Holy Ghost, that both the conception and
the bringing forth of the Virgin may be sanctified.</p>

<p>11. These things, since they are asserted upon the warrant of the Prophetical Scriptures,
may possibly silence the Jews, infidel and incredulous though they be. But the Pagans are
wont to ridicule us when they hear us speak of a Virgin-birth. We must, therefore, say a few
words in reply to their cavils. Every birth, I suppose, depends upon three conditions. There
must be a woman of mature age, she must have intercourse with a man, her womb must
not be barren. Of these three conditions, in the birth of which we are speaking, one was
wanting, the man. And this, forasmuch as He of Whose birth we speak was not an earthly
but a heavenly man, was supplied by the Heavenly Spirit, the virginity of the mother being
preserved inviolate. And yet why should it be thought marvellous for a virgin to conceive,
when it is well known that the Eastern bird, which they call the Phoenix, is in such wise born,
or born again, without the intervention of a mate, that it remains continually one, and
continually by being born or born again succeeds itself?3282 That bees know no wedlock,
and no bringing forth of young, is notorious. There are also other things which are found
to be subject to some such law of birth. Shall it be thought incredible, then, that was done
by divine power, for the renewal and restoration of the whole world, of which instances are
observed in the nativity of animals? And yet it is strange that the Gentiles should think this
impossible, who believe their own Minerva to have been born from the brain of Jupiter.
What is more difficult to believe, or what more contrary to nature? Here, there is a woman,
the order of nature is kept, there is conception, and in due time birth; there, there is no female,
but a man alone, and—birth! Why does he who believes the one marvel at the other? Again,
they say that Father Bacchus was born from Jupiter’s thigh. Here is another portent, yet it
is believed. Venus also, whom they call Aphrodite, was born, they believe, of the foam of
the sea, as her compounded name shews. They affirm that Castor and Pollux were born of
an egg, the Myrmidons of ants. There are a thousand other things which, though contrary
to nature, find credit with them, such as the stones thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha, and
the crop of men sprung from thence. And when they believe such myths and so many of
them, does one thing seem impossible to them, that a woman of mature age, not defiled by
man but impregnated by the Holy Ghost, should conceive a divine progeny? who, forsooth,
if they are hard of belief, ought in no wise to have given credence to those prodigies, being,
as they are, so many and so degrading; but if they do believe them, they ought much more
<note type="footnote">3282 The fable of the Phoenix was very generally believed in the ancient Church, and was used as an illustration
both of the Virgin-birth, as here, and of the Resurrection. Cyril of Jerusalem (xviii. 8), whom Rufinus evidently
had in view, refers to it as a providentially designed confirmation of the latter. Possibly the Septuagint translation
of Ps. xcii. 12, “The righteous shall flourish as a palm tree,” ὡς φοίνιξ may have been thought to sanction the
fable. On the Literature connected with the Phoenix, see Bp. Jacobson’s edition or the Apostolical Fathers,

<p>12. But they say, perhaps, If it was possible to God that a virgin should conceive, it was
possible also that she should bring forth, but they think it unmeet that a being of so great
majesty should enter the world in such wise, that even though there had been no defilement
from intercourse with man, there should yet be the unseemliness attendant upon the act of
delivery. To which let us reply briefly, meeting them on their own level. If a person should
see a little child in the act of being suffocated in a quagmire, and himself, a great man and
powerful, should go into the mire, just at its verge, so to say, to rescue the dying child; would
you blame this man as defiled for having stepped into a little mire, or would you praise him
as merciful, for having preserved the life of one that was perishing? But the case supposed
is that of an ordinary man. Let us return to the nature of Him Who was born. How much,
think you, is the nature of the Sun inferior to him? How much beyond doubt, the Creature
to the Creator? Consider now if a ray of the sun alights upon a quagmire, does it receive
any pollution from it? or is the sun the worse for shedding his light upon foul objects? Fire,
too, how far inferior is its nature to the things of which we are speaking? Yet no substance,
whether foul or vile, is believed to pollute fire if applied to it. When the case is plainly thus
with regard to material things, do you suppose that aught of pollution and defilement can
befall that supereminent and incorporeal nature, which is above all fire and all light? Then,
lastly, note this also: we say that man was created by God out of the clay of the earth. But if
God is thought to be defiled in seeking to recover His own work, much more must He be
thought so in making that work originally. And it is idle to ask why He passed through what
is repugnant to our sense of modesty, when you cannot tell why He made what is so repugnant.
And therefore it is not nature but general estimation that has made us think these
things to be such. Otherwise, all things that are in the body, being formed from one and the
same clay, are distinguished from one another only in their uses and natural offices.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">    
<pb n="1406"/>
<p>13. But there is another consideration which we must not leave out in the solution of
this question, namely, that the substance of God, which is wholly incorporeal, cannot be
introduced into bodies or be received by them in the first instance, unless there be some
spiritual substance as a medium, which is capable of receiving the divine Spirit. For instance,
if we say that light is able to irradiate all the members of the body, yet by none of them can
it be received except by the eye. For it is the eye alone which is receptive of light. So the Son
of God is born of a virgin, not associated with the flesh alone in the first instance, but begotten
with a soul as a medium between the flesh and God. With the soul, then, serving as a medium,
and receiving the Word of God in the secret citadel of the rational spirit, God was born of
the Virgin without any such disparagement as you imagine. And therefore nothing is to be
esteemed base or unseemly wherein was the sanctification of the Spirit, and where the soul
which was capable of God became also a partaker of flesh. Account nothing impossible
where the power of the Most High was present. Have no thought of human weakness where
there was the plenitude of Divinity.</p>

The Apostle Paul teaches us that we ought to have “the eyes of our understanding enlightened”
3283 “that we may understand what is the height and breadth and depth.”3284
“The height and breadth and depth” is a description of the Cross, of which that part which
is fixed in the earth he calls the depth, the height that which is erected upon the earth and
reaches upward, the breadth that which is spread out to the right hand and to the left. Since,
therefore, there are so many kinds of death by which it is given to men to depart this life,
why does the Apostle wish us to have our understanding enlightened so as to know the
reason why, of all of them, the Cross was chosen in preference for the death of the Saviour.
We must know, then, that that Cross was a triumph. It was a signal trophy. A triumph is a
token of victory over an enemy. Since then Christ, when He came, brought three kingdoms
at once into subjection under His sway (for this He signifies when he says, “That in the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under
the earth”),3285 and conquered all of these by His death, a death was sought answerable to
the mystery, so that being lifted up in the air, and subduing the powers of the air, He might
make a display of His victory over these supernatural and celestial powers. Moreover the
holy Prophet says that “all the day long He stretched out His hands”3286 to the people on
the earth, that He might both make protestation to unbelievers and invite believers: finally,
by that part which is sunk under the earth, He signified His bringing into subjection to
Himself the kingdoms of the nether world.</p>

<p>15. Moreover,—to touch briefly some of the more recondite topics,—when God made
the world in the beginning, He set over it and appointed certain powers of celestial virtues
by whom the race of mortal men might be governed and directed. That this was so done
Moses signifies in the Song in Deuteronomy, “When the Most High divided the nations,
He appointed the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.”3287
But some of these, as he who is called the Prince of this world, did not exercise the power
which God had committed to them according to the laws by which they had received it, nor
did they teach mankind to obey God’s commandments, but taught them rather to follow
their own perverse guidance. Thus we were brought under the bonds of sin, because, as the
Prophet saith, “We were sold under our sins.”3288 For every man, when he yields to lust, is
receiving the purchase-money of his soul. Under that bond then every man was held by
those most wicked rulers, which same bond Christ, when He came, tore down and stripped
them of this their power. This Paul signifies under a great mystery, when he says of Him,
“He destroyed the hand-writing which was against us, nailing it to His cross, and led away
principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.”3289 Those rulers, then, whom
God had set over mankind, having become contumacious and tyrannical, took in hand to
assail the men who had been committed to their charge and to rout them utterly in the
conflicts of sin, as the Prophet Ezekiel mystically intimates when he says, “In that day angels3290
shall come forth hastening to exterminate Ethiopia, and there shall be perturbation
among them in the day of Egypt; for behold He comes.”3291 Having stript them then of their
almighty power, Christ is said to have triumphed, and to have delivered to men the power
which was taken from them, as also Himself saith to His disciples in the Gospel, “Behold I
have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the might of the
enemy.”3292 The Cross of Christ, then, brought those who had wrongfully abused the authority
which they had received into subjection to those who had before been in subjection
to them. But us, that is, mankind, it teaches first of all to resist sin even unto death, and
willingly to die for the sake of religion. Next, this same Cross sets before us an example of
obedience, in like manner as it hath punished the contumacy of those who were once our
rulers. Hear, therefore, how the Apostle would teach us obedience by the Cross of Christ:
“Let this mind be in you, which was in Christ Jesus, Who, being in the form of God, thought
it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking upon Him

the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and, being found in fashion as a
man, He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.”3293 As, then, a consummate
master teaches both by example and precept, so Christ taught the obedience, which
good men are to render even at the cost of death, by Himself first dying in rendering it.</p>

<p>16. But perhaps some one is alarmed at hearing us discourse of the death of Him of
Whom, a short while since, we said that He is everlasting with God the Father, and that He
was begotten of the Father’s substance, and is one with God the Father, in dominion, majesty,
and eternity. But be not alarmed, O faithful hearer. Presently thou wilt see Him of Whose
death thou hearest once more immortal; for the death to which He submits is about to spoil
death. For the object of that mystery of the Incarnation which we expounded just now was
that the divine virtue of the Son of God, as though it were a hook concealed beneath the
form and fashion of human flesh (He being, as the Apostle Paul says, “found in fashion as
a man”),3294 might lure on the Prince of this world to a conflict, to whom offering His flesh
as a bait, His divinity underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its hook, through
the shedding of His immaculate blood. For He alone Who knows no stain of sin hath destroyed
the sins of all, of those, at least, who have marked the door-posts of their faith with
His blood. As, therefore, if a fish seizes a baited hook, it not only does not take the bait off
the hook, but is drawn out of the water to be itself food for others, so He Who had the power
of death seized the body of Jesus in death, not being aware of the hook of Divinity inclosed
within it, but having swallowed it he was caught forthwith, and the bars of hell being burst
asunder, he was drawn forth as it were from the abyss to become food for others. Which
result the Prophet Ezekiel long ago foretold under this same figure, saying, “I will draw thee
out with My hook, and stretch thee out upon the earth: the plains shall be filled with thee,
and I will set all the fowls of the air over thee, and I will satiate all the beasts of the earth
with thee.”3295 The Prophet David also says, “Thou hast broken the heads of the great
dragon, Thou hast given him to be meat to the people of Ethiopia.”3296 And Job in like
manner witnesses of the same mystery, for he says in the person of the Lord speaking to
him, “Wilt thou draw forth the dragon with a hook, and wilt thou put thy bit in his nostrils?”

<p>17. It is with no loss or disparagement therefore of His Divine nature that Christ suffers
in the flesh, but His Divine nature through the flesh descended into death, that by the infirmity
of the flesh He might effect salvation; not that He might be detained by death according
to the law of mortality, but that He might by Himself in his resurrection open the gates
of death. It is as if a king were to proceed to a prison, and to go in and open the doors, undo
the fetters, break in pieces the chains, the bars, and the bolts, and bring forth and set at
liberty the prisoners, and restore those who are sitting in darkness and in the shadow of
death to light and life. The king, therefore, is said indeed to have been in prison, but not
under the same condition as the prisoners who were detained there. They were in prison to
be punished, He to free them from punishment.</p>

<p>18. They who have handed down the Creed to us have with much forethought specified
the time when these things were done—“under Pontius Pilate,”—lest in any respect the
tradition should falter, as though vague and uncertain. But it should be known that the
clause, “He descended into Hell,” is not added in the Creed of the Roman Church, neither
is it in that of the Oriental Churches. It seems to be implied, however, when it is said that
“He was buried.” But in the love and zeal for the Divine Scriptures which possess you, you
say to me, I doubt not, “These things ought to be proved by more evident testimonies from
the Divine Scriptures. For the more important the things are which are to be believed, so
much the more do they need apt and undoubted witness.” True. But we, as speaking to those
who know the law, have left unnoticed, for the sake of brevity, a whole forest of testimonies.
But if this also be required, let us cite a few out of many, knowing, as we do, that to those
who are acquainted with the Scriptures, a very ample sea of testimonies lies open.</p>

<p>19. First of all, then, we must know that the doctrine of the Cross is not regarded by all
in the same light. It is one thing to the Gentiles, to the Jews another, to Christians another;
as also the Apostle says, “We preach Christ crucified,—to the Jews a stumbling-block, to
the Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power
of God and the wisdom of God;”3298 and, in the same place, “For the preaching of the Cross
is to those who perish foolishness, but to those who are saved,” that is, to us, it is “the Power
of God.”3299 The Jews, to whom it had been delivered out of the Law, that Christ should
abide for ever, were offended by His Cross, because they were unwilling to believe His resurrection.
To the Gentiles it seemed foolishness that God should have submitted to death,
because they were ignorant of the mystery of the Incarnation. But Christians, who had ac-
cepted His birth and passion in the flesh and His resurrection from the dead, of course believed
that it was the power of God which had overcome death.</p>
<p>First, therefore, hear how this very thing is prophetically declared by Isaiah, that the
Jews, to whom the Prophets had foretold these things, would not believe, but that they who
had never heard them from the Prophets, would believe them. “To whom He was not spoken
of they shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.”3300 Moreover, this same
Isaiah foretells that, while those who were engaged in the study of the Law from childhood
to old age believed not, to the Gentiles every mystery should be transferred. His words are:
“And the Lord of Hosts shall make a feast on this mountain unto all nations: they shall drink
joy, they shall drink wine, they shall be anointed with ointment on this mountain. Deliver
all these things to the nations.”3301 This was the counsel of the Almighty respecting all the
nations. But they who boast themselves of their knowledge of the Law will, perhaps, say to
us, “You blaspheme in saying that the Lord was subjected to the corruption of death and to
the suffering of the Cross.” Read, therefore, what you find written in the Lamentations of
Jeremiah: “The Spirit of our countenance, Christ the Lord, was taken in our3302 corruptions,
of whom we said, we shall live under His shadow among the nations.”3303 Thou hearest
how the Prophet says that Christ the Lord was taken, and for us, that is, for our sins, delivered
to corruption. Under whose shadow, since the people of the Jews have continued in unbelief,
he says the Gentiles lie, because we live not in Israel, but among the Gentiles.</p>

<p>20. But, if it does not weary you, let the point out as briefly as possible, specific references
to prophecy in the Gospels, that those who are being instructed in the first elements of the
faith may have these testimonies written on their hearts, lest any doubt concerning the
things which they believe should at any time take them by surprise. We are told in the
Gospel that Judas, one of Christ’s friends and associates at table, betrayed Him. Let the show
you how this is foretold in the Psalms: “He who hath eaten My bread hath lifted up his heel
against Me:”3304 and in another place; “My friends and My neighbours drew near and set
themselves against Me:”3305 and again; “His words were made softer than oil and yet be
they very darts.”3306 What then is meant by his words were made soft? “Judas came to Jesus
and said unto Him, Hail, Master, and kissed Him.”3307 Thus through the soft blandishment
of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of betrayal. On which the Lord said to him, “Judas,
betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?”3308 You observe that He was appraised by the
traitor’s covetousness at thirty pieces of silver. Of this also the Prophet speaks, “And I said
unto them, If ye think good, give me my price, or if not, forbear;” and presently, “I received
from them,” he says, “thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into
the foundry.”3309 Is not this what is written in the Gospels, that Judas, “repenting of what
he had done, brought back the money, and threw it down in the temple and departed?”3310
Well did He call it His price, as though blaming and upbraiding. For He had done so many
good works among them, He had given sight to the blind, feet to the lame, the power of
walking to the palsied, life also to the dead; for all these good works they paid Him death as
His price, appraised at thirty pieces of silver. It is related also in the Gospels that He was
bound. This also the word of prophecy had foretold by Isaiah, saying, “Woe unto their soul,
who have devised a most evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind the just One,
seeing that He is unprofitable to us.”3311</p>

<p>21. But, says some one, “Are these things to be understood of the Lord? Could the Lord
be held prisoner by men and dragged to judgment?” Of this also the same Prophet shall
convince you. For he says, “The Lord Himself shall come into judgment with the elders and
princes of the people.”3312 The Lord is judged then according to the Prophet’s testimony,
and not only judged, but scourged, and smitten on the face with the palms (of men’s hands),
and spitted on, and suffers every insult and indignity for our sake. And because all who
should hear these things preached by the Apostles would be perfectly amazed, therefore also
the Prophet speaking in their person exclaims, “Lord, who hath believed our report?”3313
For it is incredible that God, the Son of God, should be spoken of and preached as having
suffered these things. For this reason they are foretold by the Prophets, lest any doubt should
spring up in those who are about to believe. Christ the Lord Himself therefore in His own
person, says, “I gave My back to the scourges, and My cheeks to the palms,3314 I turned not
away My face from shame and spitting.”3315 This also is written among His other sufferings,
that they bound Him, and led Him away to Pilate. This also the Prophet foretold, saying,
“And they bound him and conducted Him as a pledge of friendship (xenium) to King Jarim.”
3316 But some one objects, “But Pilate was not a king.” Hear then what the Gospel relates
next, “Pilate hearing that He was from Galilee, sent Him to Herod, who was king in Israel
at that time.”3317 And rightly does the Prophet add the name “Jarim,” which means “a wildvine,
for Herod was not of the house of Israel, nor of that Israelitish vine which the Lord
had brought out of Egypt, and “planted in a very fruitful hill,”3318 but was a wild vine, i.e.
of an alien stock. Rightly, therefore, was he called “a wild-vine,” because he in nowise sprung
from the shoots of the vine of Israel. And whereas the Prophet used the phrase “xenium,”
“A pledge of friendship,” this also corresponds, “For Herod and Pilate,” as the Gospel witnesses,
“from being enemies were made friends,”3319 and, as though in token of their reconciliation,
each sent Jesus bound to the other. What matter, so long as Jesus, as Saviour, reconciles
those who were at variance, and restores peace, and also brings back concord!
Wherefore of this also it is written in Job, “May the Lord reconcile the hearts of the princes
of the earth.”3320</p>

<p>22. It is related that when Pilate would fain have released Him all the people cried out,
“Crucify Him, Crucify Him!”3321 This also the Prophet Jeremiah foretells, saying, in the
person of the Lord Himself, “My inheritance is become to Me as a lion in the forest. He hath
uttered his voice against Me, wherefore I have hated it. And therefore (saith He) I have
forsaken and left My house.”3322 And again in another place, “Against whom have ye opened
your mouth, and against whom have ye let loose your tongues?”3323 When He stood before
His judge, it is written that “He held His peace.”3324 Many Scriptures testify of this. In the
Psalms it is written, “I became as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.”
3325 And again, “I was as a deaf man, and heard not, and as one that is dumb and
openeth not his mouth.” And again another Prophet saith, “As a lamb before her shearer,
so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.”3326 It is
written that there was put on Him a crown of thorns. Of this hear in the Canticles the voice
of God the Father marvelling at the iniquity of Jerusalem in the insult done to His Son: “Go
forth and see, ye daughters of Jerusalem, the crown wherewith His mother hath crowned
Him.”3327 Moreover, of the thorns another Prophet makes mention: “I looked that she
should bring forth grapes, and she brought forth thorns, and instead of righteousness a
cry.”3328 But that thou mayest know the secrets of the mystery, it behoved Him, Who came
to take away the sins of the world, to free the earth also from the curse, which it had received
through the sin of the first man, when the Lord said “Cursed be the earth in thy labours:
thorns: and thistles shall it bring forth to thee.”3329 For this cause, therefore, is Jesus crowned
with thorns, that first sentence of condemnation might be remitted. He is led to the cross,
and the life of the whole word is suspended on the wood of which it is made. I would point
out how this also is confirmed by testimony from the Prophets. You find Jeremiah speaking
of it thus, “Come and let us cast wood into His bread, and crush Him out of the land of the
living.”3330 And again, Moses, mourning over them, says, “Thy life shall be suspended before
thine eyes, and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt not believe thy life.”3331 But we must

<p>23. It is written that when the side of Jesus was pierced “He shed thereout blood and
water.”3332 This has a mystical meaning. For Himself had said, “Out of His belly shall flow
rivers of living water.”3333 But He shed forth blood also, of which the Jews sought that it
might be upon themselves and upon their children. He shed forth water, therefore, which
might wash believers; He shed forth blood also which might condemn unbelievers. Yet it
might be understood also as prefiguring the twofold grace of baptism, one that which is
given by the baptism of water, the other that which is sought through martyrdom in the
outpouring of blood, for both are called baptism. But if you ask further why our Lord is said
to have poured forth blood and water from His side rather than from any other member, I
imagine that by the rib in the side the woman is signified. Since the fountain of sin and death
proceeded from the first woman, who was the rib of the first Adam, the fountain of redemption
and life is drawn from the rib of the second Adam.</p>

sixth hour until the ninth. To this also you will find the Prophet witnessing, “Thy Sun shall
go down at mid-day.”3334 And again, the Prophet Zechariah, “In that day there shall be no
more light. There shall be cold and frost in one day, and that day known to the Lord; and
it shall be neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light.”3335 What plainer
language could the Prophet have used for his words to seem not so much a prophecy of the
future as a narrative of the past? He foretold both the cold and the frost. For Peter was
warming himself at the fire because it was cold: and he was suffering cold not only in respect
of the time (the early hour), but also of his faith. There is added,3336 “and that day shall be
known to the Lord; and it shall be neither day nor night.” What is “neither day nor night?”
Did he not plainly speak of the darkness interposed in the day, and then the light afterwards
restored? That was not day, for it did not begin with sun-rise, neither was it complete night,
for it did not, when the day was ended, receive its due space from the beginning or prolong
it to the end; but the light which had been driven away by the crime of wicked men is restored
at evening time. For after the ninth hour, the darkness is driven away, and the sun is restored
to the world. Again, another Prophet witnesses of the same, “The light shall be darkened
upon the earth in the day-time.”3337</p>

themselves, and cast lots upon His vesture. The Holy Spirit provided that this also should
be witnessed beforehand by the Prophets, for David says, “They parted my garments among
them, and upon my vesture they did cast lots.”3338 Nor were the Prophets silent even as to
the robe, the scarlet robe, which the soldiers are said to have put upon Him in mockery.
Listen to Isaiah, “Who is this that cometh from Edom, red in his garments from Bozrah?
Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as though thou hadst trodden in the winepress?”
To which Himself replies, “I have trodden the wine-press alone, O daughter of
Sion.”3339 For He alone it is Who hath not sinned, and hath taken away the sins of the world.
For if by one man death could enter into the world, how much more by one man, Who was
God also, could life be restored!</p>

which is bitterer than gall. Hear what the Prophet has foretold of this: “They gave Me gall
to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave Me vinegar to drink.”3340 Agreeably with which
Moses, even in his day, said to the people, “Their vine is of the vineyards of Sodom, and
their branch of Gomorrah; their grape is a grape of gall, and their cluster a cluster of bitterness.”
3341 And again, the Prophet upbraiding them says, “Oh foolish people and unwise,
have ye thus requited the Lord?”3342 Moreover, in the Canticles the same things are foretold,
where even the garden in which the Lord was crucified is indicated: “I have come into my
garden, my sister, my spouse, and have gathered in my myrrh.”3343 Here the Prophet has
plainly set forth the wine mingled with myrrh which the Lord has given Him to drink.</p>

the Prophet, who says, addressing the Father in the Person of the Son, “Into Thy hands I
commend My Spirit.”3345 He is related also to have been buried, and a great stone laid at
the door of the sepulchre. Hear what the word of prophecy foretold by Jeremiah concerning
this also, “They have cut off my life in the pit, and have laid a stone upon Me.”3346 These
words of the Prophet point most plainly to His burial. Here are yet others, “The righteous
hath been taken away from beholding iniquity, and his place is in peace.”3347 And in another
place, “I will give the malignant for his burial;”3348 and yet once more, “He hath lain down
and slept as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who shall rouse Him up?”3349</p>

“Thou hast brought Me also into the dust of the death.”3350 And again, “What profit is there
in my blood, when I shall have descended into corruption?”3351 And again, “I descended
into the deep mire, where there is no bottom.”3352 Moreover, John says, “Art Thou He that
shall come (into hell, without doubt), or do we look for another?”3353 Whence also Peter
says that “Christ being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit which dwells in
Him, descended to the spirits who were shut up in prison, who in the days of Noah believed
not, to preach unto them;”3354 where also what He did in hell is declared. Moreover, the
Lord says by the Prophet, as though speaking of the future, “Thou wilt not leave my soul in
hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.”3355 Which again, in
prophetic language he speaks of as actually fulfilled, “O Lord, Thou hast brought my soul
out of hell: Thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.”3356 There follows

<p>29. The Third Day He Rose Again from the Dead. The glory of Christ’s resurrection
threw a lustre upon everything which before had the appearance of weakness and frailty. If
a while since it seemed to you impossible that an immortal Being could die, you see now
that He who has overcome death and is risen again cannot be mortal. But understand herein
the goodness of the Creator, that so far as you by sinning have cast yourself down, so far
has He descended in following you. And do not impute lack of power to God, the Creator
of all things, by imagining his work to have ended in the fall into an abyss which He in His
redemptive purpose was unable to reach. We speak of infernal and supernal, because we
are bounded by the definite circumference of the body, and are confined within the limits
of the region prescribed to us. But to God, Who is present everywhere and absent nowhere,
what is infernal and what supernal? Notwithstanding, through the assumption of a body
there is room for these also. The flesh which had been deposited in the sepulchre, is raised,
that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, “Thou wilt not suffer Thy
Holy One to see corruption.”3357 He returned, therefore, a victor from the dead, leading
with Him the spoils of hell. For He led forth those who were held in captivity by death, as
He Himself had foretold, when He said, “When I shall be lifted up from the earth I shall
draw all unto Me.”3358 To this the Gospel bears witness, when it says, “The graves were
opened, and many bodies of saints which slept arose, and appeared unto many, and entered
into the holy City,”3359 that city, doubtless, of which the Apostle says, “Jerusalem which is
above is free, which is the Mother of us all.”3360 As also he says again to the Hebrews, “It
became Him, for Whom are all things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many
sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.”3361 Sitting,
therefore, on the right hand of God in the highest heavens, He placed there that human
flesh, made perfect through sufferings, which had fallen to death by the lapse of the first
man, but was now restored by the virtue of the resurrection. Whence also the Apostle says,
“Who hath raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places.”3362 For
He was the potter, Who, as the Prophet Jeremiah teaches, “took up again with His hands,
and formed anew, as it seemed good to Him, the vessel which had fallen from His hands
and was broken in pieces.”3363 And it seemed good to Him that the mortal and corruptible
body which He had assumed, this body raised from the rocky sepulchre and rendered im-

mortal and incorruptible, He should now place not on the earth but in heaven, and at His
Father’s right hand. The Scriptures of the Old Testament are full of these mysteries. No
Prophet, no Lawgiver, no Psalmist is silent, but almost every one of the sacred pages speaks
of them. It seems superfluous, therefore, to linger in collecting testimonies; yet we will cite
some few, remitting those who desire to drink more largely to the well-springs of the divine
volumes themselves.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">

<p>30. It is said then in the Psalms, “I laid me down and slept, and rose up again, because
the Lord sustained me.”3364 Again, in another place, “Because of the wretchedness of the
needy and the groaning of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord.”3365 And elsewhere, as
we have said above, “O Lord, thou hast brought my soul out of hell; Thou hast saved me
from them that go down into the pit.”3366 And in another place, “Because Thou hast turned
and quickened me, and brought me out of the deep of the earth again.”3367 In the 87th
Psalm He is most evidently spoken of: “He became as a man without help, free among the
dead.”3368 It is not said “a man,” but “as a man.” For in that He descended into hell, He was
“as a man:” but He was “free among the dead,” because He could not be detained by death.
And therefore in the one nature the power of human weakness, in the other the power of
divine majesty is exhibited. The Prophet Hosea also speaks most manifestly of the third day
in this wise, “After two days He will heal us; but on the third day we shall rise and shall live
in His presence.”3369 This he says in the person of those who, rising with Him on the third
day, are recalled from death to life. And they are the same persons who say, “On the third
day we shall rise again, and shall live in His presence.” But Isaiah says plainly, “Who brought
forth from the earth the great Shepherd of the sheep.”3370 Then, that the women were to
see His resurrection, while the Scribes and Pharisees and the people disbelieved, this also
Isaiah foretold in these words, “Ye women, who come from beholding, come: for it is a
people that hath no understanding.”3371 But as to the women who are related to have gone
to the sepulchre after the resurrection, and to have sought Him without finding, as Mary
Magdalene, who is related to have come to the sepulchre before it was light, and not finding
Him, to have said, weeping, to the angels who were there, “They have taken away the Lord,
and I know not where they have laid Him”3372—even this is foretold in the Canticles: “On
my bed I sought Him Whom my soul loveth; I sought Him in the night, and found Him
not.”3373 Of those also who found Him, and held Him by the feet, it is foretold, in the same
book, “I will hold Him Whom my soul loveth, and will not let Him go.”3374 Take these
passages, a few of many; for being intent on brevity we cannot heap together more.</p>

<p>31. He Ascended into Heaven, and Sitteth on the Right Hand of the Father: from Thence
He Shall Come to Judge the Quick and the Dead. These clauses follow with suitable brevity
at the end of this part of the Creed which treats of the Son. What is said is plain, but the
question is how and in what sense it is to be understood. For to “ascend,” and to “sit,” and
to “come,” unless you understand the words in accordance with the dignity of the divine
nature, appear to point to something of human weakness. For having consummated what
was to be done on earth, and having recalled souls from the captivity of hell, He is spoken
of as ascending up to heaven, as the Prophet had foretold, “Ascending up on high He led
captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,”3375 those gifts, namely, which Peter, in the Acts
of the Apostles, spoke of concerning the Holy Ghost, “Being therefore by the right hand of
God exalted, He hath shed forth this gift which ye do see and hear.”3376 He gave the gift of
the Holy Ghost to men, because the captives, whom the devil had before carried into hell
through sin, Christ by His resurrection from death recalled to heaven. He ascended therefore
into heaven, not where God the Word had not been before, for He was always in heaven,
and abode in the Father, but where the Word made flesh had not been seated before. Lastly,
since this entrance within the gates of heaven seemed new to its ministers and princes, they
say to one another, on seeing the nature of flesh penetrating into the secret recesses of
heaven, as David full of the Holy Ghost, declares, “Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye
lift up ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter in. Who is the King of glory?
The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.”3377 Which words are spoken not
with reference to the power of the divine nature, but with reference to the novelty of flesh
ascending to the right hand of God. The same David says elsewhere, “God hath ascended
jubilantly, and the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.”3378 For conquerors are wont to
return from battle with the sound of the trumpet. Of Him also it is said, “Who buildeth up
His ascent in heaven.”3379 And again, “Who hath ascended above the cherubims, flying
upon the wings of the winds.”3380</p>

<p>32. To sit at the right hand of the Father is a mystery belonging to the Incarnation. For
it does not befit that incorporeal nature without the assumption of flesh; neither is the excellency
of a heavenly seat sought for the divine nature, but for the human. Whence it is
said of Him, “Thy seat, O God, is prepared from thence forward; Thou art from everlasting.”
3381 The seat, then, whereon the Lord Jesus was to sit, was prepared from everlasting,
“in whose name every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth, and things
under the earth; and every tongue shall confess to Him that Jesus is Lord in the glory of God
the Father;”3382 of Whom also David thus speaks, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou
on my right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”3383 Referring to which words
the Lord in the Gospel said to the Pharisees, “If therefore David in spirit calleth Him Lord,
how is He his Son?”3384 By which He shewed that according to the Spirit He was the Lord,
according to the flesh He was the Son, of David. Whence also the Lord Himself says in another
place, “Verily I say unto you, henceforth ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right
hand of the power of God.”3385 And the Apostle Peter says of Christ, “Who is on the right
hand of God, seated in the heavens.”3386 And Paul also, writing to the Ephesians, “According
to the working of the might of His power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him
from the dead, and seated Him on His right hand.”3387</p>

<p>33. That He shall come to judge the quick and the dead we are taught by many testimonies
of the divine Scriptures. But before we cite what the Prophets say on this point, we think
it necessary to remind you that this doctrine of the faith would have us daily solicitous
concerning the coming of the Judge, that we may so frame our conduct as having to give
account to the Judge who is at hand. For this is what the Prophet said of the man who is
blessed, that, “He ordereth his words in judgment.”3388 When, however, He is said to judge
the quick and the dead, this does not mean that some will come to judgment who are still
living, others who are already dead; but that He will judge both souls and bodies, where, by
souls are meant “the quick,” and the bodies “the dead;” as also the Lord Himself saith in the
Gospel, “Fear not them who are able to kill the body, but are not able to hurt the soul; but
rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”3389</p>

<pb n="1430"/>
<p>34. Now let us shew briefly, if you will, that these things were foretold by the Prophets.
You will yourself, since you are so minded, gather together more from the ample range of
the Scriptures. The Prophet Malachi says, “Behold the Lord Almighty shall come, and who
shall abide the day of His coming, or who shall abide the sight of Him? For He doth come
as the fire of a furnace and as fuller’s soap: and He shall sit, refining and purifying as it were
gold and silver.”3390 But that thou mayest know more certainly Who this Lord is of Whom
these things are said, hear what the Prophet Daniel also foretells: “I saw,” saith he, “in the
vision of the night, and, behold, One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven,
and He came nigh to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before Him; and there was
given to Him dominion, and honour, and a kingdom. And all peoples, tribes, and languages
shall serve Him. And His dominion is an eternal dominion which shall not pass away, and
His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”3391 By these words we are taught not only of His
coming and judgment, but of His dominion and kingdom, that His dominion is eternal,
and His kingdom indestructible, without end; as it is said in the Creed,3392 “and of His
kingdom there shall be no end.” So that one who says that Christ’s kingdom shall one day
have an end is very far from the faith. Yet it behoves us to know that the enemy is wont to
counterfeit this salutary advent of Christ with cunning fraud in order to deceive the faithful,
and in the place of the Son of Man, Who is looked for as coming in the majesty of His
Father, to prepare the Son of Perdition with prodigies and lying signs, that instead of Christ
he may introduce Antichrist into the world; of whom the Lord Himself warned the Jews
beforehand in the Gospels, “Because I am come in My Father’s Name, and ye received Me
not, another will come in his own name, and him ye will receive.”3393 And again, “When
ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the
holy place, let him that readeth understand.”3394 Daniel, therefore, in his visions speaks
very fully and amply of the coming of that delusion: but it is not worth while to cite instances,
for we have enlarged enough already; we therefore refer any one who may wish to know
more concerning these matters to the visions themselves. The Apostle also himself says,
“Let no than deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a
falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition, who opposeth and
exalteth himself above everything that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth

Creed of Aquileia.</note>

in the temple of God, shewing himself as though himself were God.”3395 And soon afterwards,
“Then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of
His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: whose coming is after the
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.”3396 And again, shortly afterwards,
“And therefore the Lord shall send unto them strong delusion, that they may believe
a lie, that all may be judged who have not believed the truth.”3397 For this reason, therefore,
is this “delusion” foretold unto us by the words of Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles, lest
any one should mistake the coming of Antichrist for the coming of Christ. But as the Lord
Himself says, “When they shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or lo, He is there, believe it
not. For many false Christs and false prophets shall come and shall seduce many.”3398 But
let us see how He hath pointed out the judgment of the true Christ: “As the lightning shineth
from the east unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.”3399 When, therefore,
the true Lord Jesus Christ shall come, He will sit and set up his throne of judgment. As also
He says in the Gospel, “He shall separate the sheep from the goats,”3400 that is, the righteous
from the unrighteous; as the Apostle writes, “We must all stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ, that every man may receive the awards due to the body, according as he hath
done, whether they be good or evil.”3401 Moreover, the judgment will be not only for deeds,
but for thoughts also, as the same Apostle saith, “Their thoughts mutually accusing or else
excusing one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.”3402 But on these
points let this suffice. Next follows in the order of the faith,—</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<pb n="1432"/>
<p>35. And in the Holy Ghost. What has been delivered above somewhat at large concerning
Christ relates to the mystery of His Incarnation and of His Passion, and, by thus intervening,
as belonging to His Person, has somewhat delayed the mention of the Holy Spirit. Otherwise,
if the divine nature alone be taken into account, as in the beginning of the Creed we say “I
believe in God the Father Almighty,” and afterwards, “In Jesus Christ His only Son our
Lord,” so in like manner we add, “And in the Holy Ghost.” But all of these particulars which
are spoken of above concerning Christ relate, as we have said, to the dispensation of the
flesh (to His Incarnation). By the mention of the Holy Spirit, the mystery of the Trinity is
completed. For as one Father is mentioned, and there is no other Father, and one only-begotten
Son is mentioned, and there is no other only-begotten Son, so also there is one Holy
Ghost, and there cannot be another Holy Ghost. In order, therefore, that the Persons may
be distinguished, the terms expressing relationship (the properties) are varied, whereby the
first is understood to be the Father, of Whom are all things, Who Himself also hath no
Father, the second the Son, as born of the Father, and the third the Holy Ghost, as proceeding
from both,3403 and sanctifying all things. But that in the Trinity one and the same Godhead
may be set forth, since, prefixing the preposition “in” we say that we believe “in God the
Father,” so also we say, “in Christ His Son,” so also “in the Holy Ghost.” But our meaning
will be made more plain in what follows. For the Creed proceeds,—</p>
<note type="footnote">3403 Or, according to another reading, “from the mouth of God.”</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
<pb n="1433"/>
<p>36. “The Holy Church; The Forgiveness of Sin, the Resurrection of This Flesh.” It is not
said, “In the holy Church,” nor “In the forgiveness of sins,” nor “In the resurrection of the
flesh.” For if the preposition “in” had been added, it would have had the same force as in
the preceding articles. But now in those clauses in which the faith concerning the Godhead
is declared, we say “In God the Father,” and “In Jesus Christ His Son,” and “In the Holy
Ghost,” but in the rest, where we speak not of the Godhead but of creatures and mysteries,
the preposition “in ” is not added. We do not say “We believe in the holy Church,” but “We
believe the holy Church,” not as God, but as the Church gathered together to God: and we
believe that there is “forgiveness of sins;” we do not say “We believe in the forgiveness of
sins;” and we believe that there will be a “Resurrection of the flesh;” we do not say “We believe
in the resurrection of the flesh.” By this monosyllabic preposition, therefore, the Creator is
distinguished from the creatures, and things divine are separated from things human.</p>
<p>This then is the Holy Ghost, who in the Old Testament inspired the Law and the
Prophets, in the New the Gospels and the Epistles. Whence also the Apostle says, “All
Scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable for instruction.”3404 And therefore it
seems proper in this place to enumerate, as we have learnt from the tradition of the Fathers,
the books of the New and of the Old Testament, which, according to the tradition of our
forefathers, are believed to have been inspired by the Holy Ghost, and have been handed
down to the Churches of Christ.</p>
<note type="footnote">3404 2 Tim. iii. 16</note>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
<pb n="1434"/>
<p>37. Of the Old Testament, therefore, first of all there have been handed down five books
of Moses, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Then Jesus Nave, (Joshua
the son of Nun), The Book of Judges together with Ruth; then four books of Kings (Reigns),
which the Hebrews reckon two; the Book of Omissions, which is entitled the Book of Days
(Chronicles), and two books of Ezra (Ezra and Nehemiah), which the Hebrews reckon one,
and Esther; of the Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; moreover of the twelve
(minor) Prophets, one book; Job also and the Psalms of David, each one book. Solomon
gave three books to the Churches, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles. These comprise the
books of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Of the New there are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; the Acts of the Apostles,
written by Luke; fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul, two of the Apostle Peter, one of James,
brother of the Lord and Apostle, one of Jude, three of John, the Revelation of John. These
are the books which the Fathers have comprised within the Canon, and from which they
would have us deduce the proofs of our faith.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
<pb n="1435"/>
<p>38. But it should be known that there are also other books which our fathers call not
“Canonical” but “Ecclesiastical:” that is to say, Wisdom, called the Wisdom of Solomon,
and another Wisdom, called the Wisdom of the Son of Syrach, which last-mentioned the
Latins called by the general title Ecclesiasticus, designating not the author of the book, but
the character of the writing. To the same class belong the Book of Tobit, and the Book of
Judith, and the Books of the Maccabees. In the New Testament the little book which is called
the Book of the Pastor of Hermas, [and that] which is called The Two Ways,3405 or the
Judgment of Peter; all of which they would have read in the Churches, but not appealed to
for the confirmation of doctrine. The other writings they have named “Apocrypha.” These
they would not have read in the Churches.</p>
<p>These are the traditions which the Fathers have handed down to us, which, as I said, I
have thought it opportune to set forth in this place, for the instruction of those who are being
taught the first elements of the Church and of the Faith, that they may know from what
fountains of the Word of God their draughts must be taken.</p>
<note type="footnote">3405 It is believed that this book forms part of “The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles” lately discovered and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">    
<pb n="1436"/>
<p>39. We come next in the order of belief to the Holy Church. We have mentioned above
why the Creed does not say here, as in the preceding article, “In the Holy Church.” They,
therefore, who were taught above to believe in one God, under the mystery of the Trinity,
must believe this also, that there is one holy Church in which there is one faith and one
baptism, in which is believed one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and
one Holy Ghost. This is that holy Church which is without spot or wrinkle. For many others
have gathered together Churches, as Marcion, and Valentinus, and Ebion, and Manichæus,
and Arius, and all the other heretics. But those Churches are not without spot or wrinkle
of unfaithfulness. And therefore the Prophet said of them, “I hate the Church of the malignants,
and I will not sit with the ungodly.”3406 But of this Church which keeps the faith of
Christ entire, hear what the Holy Spirit says in the Canticles, “My dove is one; the perfect
one of her mother is one.”3407 He then who receives this faith in the Church let him not
turn aside in the Council of vanity, and let him not enter in with those who practise iniquity.</p>
<p>For Marcion’s assembly is a Council of vanity in that he denies that the Father of Christ
is God, the Creator, who by His Son made the world. Ebion’s is a Council of vanity since
he teaches that, while we believe in Christ, we are withal to observe the circumcision of the
flesh, the keeping of the Sabbath, the accustomed sacrifices, and all the other ordinances
according to the letter of the Law. Manichæus’ is a Council of vanity in regard of his teaching;
first in that he calls himself the Paraclete, then that he says that the world was made by an
evil God, denies God the Creator, rejects the Old Testament, asserts two natures, one good
the other evil, mutually opposing one another, affirms that men’s souls are co-eternal with
God, that, according to the Pythagoreans, they return through divers circles of nativity into
cattle and animals and beasts, denies the resurrection of our flesh, maintains that the passion
and nativity of the Lord were not in the verity of flesh, but only in appearance. It was the
Council of vanity when Paul of Samosata and his successor Photinus afterwards taught, that
Christ was not born of the Father before the world, but had His beginning from Mary, and
believed not that being God He was born man, but that of man He was made God. It was
the Council of vanity when Arius and Eunomius taught as their determinate opinion that
the Son of God was not born of the very substance of the Father, but was created out of
nothing, and that the Son of God had a beginning, and is inferior to the Father: moreover
they affirm that the Holy Ghost is not only inferior to the Son, but is also a ministering
Spirit.3408 Theirs also is a Council of vanity who confess indeed that the Son is of the sub-

stance of the Father, but distinguish and separate the Holy Spirit, while yet the Saviour shews

“Baptize all nations in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”3409
and it is plainly impious for man to put asunder what God hath joined together. That also
is the Council of vanity which a pertinacious and wicked contention formerly gathered together,
affirming that Christ assumed human flesh indeed, but not a rational soul withal,
since Christ conferred one and the same salvation on the flesh, and the animal soul, and the
reason and mind of man. That also is the Council of vanity which Donatus drew together
throughout Africa, by charging the Church with traditorship (delivering up the sacred
books), and with which Novatus disturbed men’s minds by denying the grant of repentance
to the lapsed, and condemning second marriages, though contracted possibly of necessity.
All of these then avoid as congregations of malignants. Those also, if such there be, who are
said to assert that the Son of God does not see or know the Father, as Himself is known and
seen by the Father; or that the kingdom of Christ will have an end; or that the flesh will not
be raised in the complete restoration of its substance; these also who deny that there will be
a just judgment of God in respect of all, and affirm that the devil will be absolved from the
punishment of damnation due to him. To all these, I say, let the believer turn a deaf ear. But
hold fast by the holy Church, which confesses God the Father Almighty, and His only Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord, and the Holy Ghost, of one concordant and harmonious substance,
believes that the Son of God was born of the Virgin, suffered for man’s salvation, rose again
from the dead in the same flesh in which he was born; and, lastly, hopes that He will come
the Judge of all, through Whom also both the Forgiveness of Sins and the Resurrection of
the Flesh are preached.</p>

<p>40. As to the Forgiveness of Sins, it ought to be enough simple to believe. For who would
ask the cause or the reason when a Prince grants indulgence? When the liberality of an
earthly sovereign is no fit subject for discussion, shall man’s temerity discuss God’s largess?
For the Pagans are wont to ridicule us, saying that we deceive ourselves, fancying that crimes
committed in deed can be purged by words. And they say, “Can he who has committed
murder be no murderer, and he who has committed adultery be accounted no adulterer?
How then shall one guilty of crimes of this sort all of a sudden be made holy?” But to this,
as I said, we answer better by faith than by reason. For he is King of all who hath promised
it: He is Lord of heaven and earth who assures us of it. Would you have me refuse to believe
that He who made me a man of the dust of the earth can of a guilty person make me innocent?
And that He who when I was blind made me see, or when I was deaf made me hear, or lame
walk, can recover for me my lost innocence? And to come to the witness of Nature—to kill
a man is not always criminal, but to kill of malice, not by law, is criminal. It is not the deed
then, in such matters, that condemns me, because sometimes it is rightly done, but the evil
intention of the mind. If then my mind which had been rendered criminal, and in which
the sin originated, is corrected, why should I seem to you incapable of being made innocent,
who before was criminal? For if it is plain, as I have shewn, that crime consists not in the
deed but in the will, as an evil will, prompted by an evil demon, has made me obnoxious to
sin and death, so the will prompted by the good God, being changed to good, hath restored
me to innocence and life. It is the same also in all other crimes. In this way there is found
to be no opposition between our faith and natural reason, while forgiveness of sins is imputed
not to deeds, which when once done cannot be changed, but to the mind, which it is certain
can be converted from bad to good.</p>

<p>41. This last article, which affirms the Resurrection of the Flesh, concludes the sum of
all perfection with succinct brevity. Although on this point also the faith of the Church is
impugned, not only by Gentiles, but by heretics likewise. For Valentinus altogether denies
the resurrection of the flesh, so do the Manicheans, as we shewed above. But they refuse to
listen to the Prophet Isaiah when he says, “The dead shall rise, and they who are in the graves
shall be raised,”3410 or to most wise Daniel, when he declares, “Then they who are in the
dust of the earth shall arise, these to eternal life, but those to shame and confusion.”3411 Yet
even in the Gospels, which they appear to receive, they ought to learn from our Lord and
Saviour, Who says, when instructing the Sadducees, “As touching the resurrection of the
dead: have ye not read how He saith to Moses in the Bush, I am the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, the God of Jacob? Now God is not the God of the dead but of the living.”3412
Where in what goes before He declares what and how great is the glory of the resurrection,
saying, “But in the resurrection of the dead they will neither marry or be given in marriage,
but will be as the angels of God.”3413 But the virtue of the resurrection confers on men an
angelical state, so that they who have risen from the earth shall not live again on the earth
with the brute animals but with angels in heaven—yet those only whose purer life has fitted
them for this—those, namely, who even now preserving the flesh of their soul in chastity,
have brought it into subjection to the Holy Spirit, and thus with every stain of sins done
away and changed into spiritual glory by the virtue of sanctification, have been counted
worthy to have it admitted into the society of angels.</p>

<p>42. But unbelievers cry, “How can the flesh, which has been putrified and dissolved, or
changed into dust, sometimes also swallowed up by the sea, and dispersed by the waves, be
gathered up again, and again made one, and a man’s body formed anew out of it?” To whom
our first answer is in Paul’s words: “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body, which shall be, but
bare grain of wheat or of some other seed: but God giveth it a body as seemeth good to
Him.”3414 Did you not believe that that which you see taking place every year in the seeds
which you cast into the ground will come to pass in your flesh which by the law of God is
sown in the earth? Why, pray, have you so mean an opinion of God’s power that you do
not believe it possible for the scattered dust of which each man’s flesh was composed to be
re-collected and restored to its own original fabric? Do you refuse to admit the fact when
you see mortal ingenuity search for veins of metal deeply buried in the ground, and the experienced
eye discover gold where the inexperienced thinks there is nothing but earth? Why
should we refuse to grant these things to Him who made man, when he whom He made
can do so much? And when mortal ingenuity discovers that gold has its own proper vein,
and silver another, and that a far different vein of copper, and diverse and distinct veins of
iron and lead lie concealed beneath what has the appearance of earth, shall divine power be
thought unable to discover and distinguish the component particles belonging to each man’s
flesh, even though they seem to be dispersed?</p>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
<pb n="1441"/>
<p>43. But let us endeavour to assist those souls which fail in their faith through reasons
drawn from nature. If one should mix different sorts of seeds together and sow them indiscriminately
in the earth, will not the grain of each several kind, wherever it may have been
thrown, shoot forth at the proper time in accordance with its own specific nature so as to
reproduce the condition of its own form and its own body.</p>
<p>Thus then the substance of each individual flesh, though its particles have been variously
and diversely scattered, has within it an immortal principle, since it is the flesh of an immortal
soul, and at the time which God in His good pleasure shall appoint, there will be collected
from the earth and drawn to it, its own component particles, which will be restored to that
form which death had formerly dissolved. And thus it will come to pass that to each soul
will be restored, not a confused or foreign body but its own which it had when alive, in order
that the flesh together with its own soul may for the conflicts of the present life either be
crowned if undefiled, or punished if defiled. And accordingly our Church,3415 in teaching
the faith instead of “the Resurrection of the flesh,” as the Creed is delivered in other Churches,
guardedly adds the pronoun “this”—“the resurrection of this flesh.” “Of this,” that is, no
doubt, of the person who rehearses the Creed, making the sign of the cross upon his forehead,
while he says the word, that each believer may know that his flesh, if he have kept it clean
from sin, will be a vessel of honour, useful to the Lord, prepared for every good work; but,
if defiled by sins, that it will be a vessel of wrath destined to destruction.</p>
<p>But now, concerning the glory of the resurrection and the greatness of the promise by
which God has bound Himself, if any one desires to be more fully informed, he will find
notices in almost all the divine volumes, out of which, simply by way of bringing them to
remembrance, we will mention a few passages in the present place, and then make an end
of the work which you have enjoined. The Apostle Paul makes use of such arguments as the
following in asserting that mortal flesh will rise again. “But if there be no resurrection of
the dead, then is not Christ risen. And if Christ be not risen, our preaching is vain and your
faith is vain.”3416 And presently afterwards, “But now is Christ risen from the dead, the
first-fruits of them that sleep. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every
man in his own order. Christ the first-fruits, afterwards they that are Christ’s at His coming,
then cometh the end.”3417 And afterways he adds, “Behold I shew you a mystery: We shall
all rise indeed, but we shall not3418 all be changed;” or as other copies read, “We shall all
sleep, indeed but we shall not all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the

last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall
be changed.”3419 However, whichever be the true text, writing to the Thessalonians, he says,
“I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that ye sorrow
not, as the others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so
those also who sleep through Jesus shall God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by
the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent them that sleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead who are in Christ shall rise
first: then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds
to meet Christ in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”3420</p>

<p>44. But that you may not suppose this to be a novel doctrine peculiar to Paul, I will adduce
also what the Prophet Ezekiel foretold by the Holy Ghost. “Behold,” saith he, “I will open
your graves and bring you forth out of your graves.”3421 Let me recall, further, how Job,
who abounds in mystical language, plainly predicts the resurrection of the dead. “There is
hope for a tree; for if it be cut down it will sprout again, and its shoot shall never fail. But if
its root have waxed old in the earth, and the stock thereof be dead in the dust, yet through
the scent of water it will flourish again, and put forth shoots as a young plant. But man, if
he be dead, is he departed and gone? And mortal man, if he have fallen, shall he be no
more?”3422 Dost thou not see, that in these words he is appealing to men’s sense of shame,
as it were, and saying, “Is mankind so foolish, that when they see the stock of a tree which
has been cut down shooting forth again from the ground, and dead wood again restored to
life, they imagine their own case to have no likeness to that of wood or trees?” But to convince
you that Job’s words are to be read as a question, when he says, “But mortal man when he
hath fallen shall he not rise again?” take this proof from what follows; for he adds immediately,
“But if a man be dead, shall he live?”3423 And presently afterwards he says, “I will wait
till I be made again;”3424 and afterwards he repeats the same: “Who shall raise again upon
the earth my skin, which is now draining this cup of suffering?”3425</p>

<p>45. Thus much in proof of the profession which we make in the Creed when we say
“The resurrection of this flesh.” As to the addition “this” see how consonant it is with all
that we have cited from the divine books. What else does Job signify in the place which we
explained above, “He will raise again my skin, which is now draining this cup of suffering,”
that is, which is undergoing these torments? Does he not plainly say that there will be a resurrection
of this flesh, this, I mean, which is now undergoing the extremity of trials and
tribulations? Moreover, when the Apostle says, “This corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality,”3426 are not his words those of one who in a
manner touches his body and places his finger upon it? This body then, which is now corruptible,
will by the grace of the resurrection be incorruptible, and this which is now mortal
will be clothed with virtues of immortality, that, as “Christ rising from the dead dieth no
more, death hath no more dominion over Him,”3427 so those who shall rise in Christ shall
never again feel corruption or death, not because the nature of flesh will have been cast off,
but because its condition and quality will have been changed. There will be a body, therefore,
which will rise from the dead incorruptible and immortal, not only of the righteous, but
also of sinners; of the righteous that they may be able ever to abide with Christ, of sinners
that they may undergo without end the punishment due to them.</p>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
<pb n="1445"/>
<p>46. That the righteous shall ever abide with Christ our Lord we have proved above,
where we have shewn that the Apostle says, “Then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so shall we ever
be with the Lord.”3428 And do not marvel that the flesh of the saints is to be changed into
such a glorious condition at the resurrection as to be caught up to meet God, suspended in
the clouds and borne in the air, since the same Apostle, setting forth the great things which
God bestows on them that love Him, says, “Who shall change our vile body that it may be
made like unto His glorious body.”3429 It is nowise absurd then, if the bodies of the saints
are said to be raised up into the air, seeing that they are said to be renewed after the image
of Christ’s body, which is seated at God’s right hand. But this also the holy Apostle adds,
speaking either of himself or of others of his own place or merit, “He will raise us up together
with Christ and make us sit together in the heavenly places.”3430 Whence, since God’s saints
have these promises and an infinite number like them respecting the resurrection of the
righteous, it will now not be difficult to believe those also which the Prophets have foretold,
namely, that “the righteous shall shine as the sun and as the brightness of the firmament in
the kingdom of God.”3431 For who will think it difficult that they should have the brightness
of the sun, and be adorned with the splendour of the stars and of this firmament, for whom
the life and conversation of God’s angels are being prepared in heaven, or who are represented
as being hereafter to be conformed to the glory of Christ’s body? In reference to which glory,
promised by the Saviour’s mouth, the holy Apostle says, “It is sown as an animal body; it
will rise a spiritual body.”3432 For if it is true, as it certainly is true, that God will vouchsafe
to associate every one of the righteous and of the saints in companionship with the angels,
it is certain that He will change their bodies also into the glory of a spiritual body.</p>

<p>47. Nor let this promise seem to you contrary to the natural structure of the body. For
if we believe, according to what is written, that God took clay of the earth and made man,
and that the origin of our body was this, that, by the will of God, earth was changed into
flesh, why does it seem absurd to you or contrary to reason if, on the same principles on
which earth is said to be advanced to all animal body, an animal body in turn should be
believed to be advanced to a spiritual body? These things and many like these you will find
in the divine Scriptures concerning the resurrection of the righteous. There will be given to
sinners also, as we said above, a condition of incorruption and immortality at the resurrection,
that, as God assigns this state to the righteous for perpetuity of glory, so He may assign the
same to sinners for prolongation of confusion and punishment. For this also the Prophet’s
words, which we referred to above, state clearly: “Many shall rise from the dust of the earth,
some to life eternal, and others to confusion and eternal shame.”3433</p>

Father, and in what mysterious sense our Lord Jesus Christ is held to be His only Son, and
with what entire perfection of meaning His Spirit is called the Holy Spirit, and how the Holy
Trinity is one in substance but has distinctions of relation and of Persons, what also is the
birth from a Virgin, what the nativity of the Word in the flesh, what the mystery of the
Cross, what the purpose of our Lord’s descent into hell, what the glory of the Resurrection,
and the delivery of souls from their captivity in the infernal regions, what also His ascension
into heaven, and the expected advent of the Judge; moreover how the holy Church ought
to be acknowledged as opposed to the congregations of vanity, what is the number of the
sacred Volume, what conventicles of heretics ought to be avoided, and how in the forgiveness
of sins there is no opposition whatever between the divine freedom and natural reason, and
how not only the sacred oracles but also the example of Lord and Saviour Himself, and the
conclusions of natural reason, confirm the truth of the resurrection of our flesh;—if, I say,
we have intelligently followed these in succession in accordance with the rule of the tradition
hereinbefore expounded, we pray that the Lord will grant to us, and to all who hear these
words, that having kept the faith which we have received, having finished our course, we

<p>Addressed to Bishop Gaudentius.</p>
<p>(For the occasion and date3434 of this work see the Prolegomena, p. 412.)</p>
<p>You possess so much vigour of character, my dear Gaudentius, you who are so signal
an ornament of our teachers, or as I would rather say, you have the grace of the Spirit in so
large a measure, that even what you say in the way of daily conversation, or of addresses
that you preach in church,3435 ought to be consigned in writing and handed down for the
instruction of posterity. But I am far less quick, my native talent being but slender, and old
age is already making me sluggish and slow; and this work is nothing but the payment of a
debt due to the command laid upon me by the virgin Sylvia whose memory I revere. She it
was who demanded of me, as you have now done by the right of heirship, to translate
Clement into our language. The debt is paid at last, though after many delays. It is a part of
the booty, and in my opinion no small one, which I have carried off from the libraries of
the Greeks, and which I am collecting for the use and advantage of our countrymen. I have
no food of my own to bring them, and I must import their nourishment from abroad.
However, foreign goods are apt to appear sweeter; and sometimes they are really more
useful. Moreover, almost anything which brings healing to our bodies or is a defence against
disease or an antidote to poison comes from abroad. Judæa sends us the distillation of the
balsam tree, Crete the leaf of the dictamnus, Arabia her aromatic flowers, and India the crop
of the spikenard. These goods come to us, no doubt, in a less perfect condition than those
which our own fields produce, but they preserve intact their pleasant scent and their healing
power. Therefore, my friend who are as my own soul, I present to you Clement returning
to Rome. I present him dressed in a Latin garb. Do not think it strange if the aspect which
his eloquence presents is less bright than it might be. It makes no difference if only the
meaning is felt to be the same.</p>
<p>These are foreign wares, then, which I am importing at a great expense of labour; and
I have still to see whether our countrymen will regard with gratitude one who is bringing
them the spoils (spolia) of his warfare, and who is unlocking with the key of our language
a treasure house hitherto concealed, though he does it with the utmost good will. I only
trust that God may look favourably on your good wishes, so that my present may not be

monstrous phenomenon, expressions of illwill on the part of those on whom the gift is
conferred, while those from whom it is taken part with it ungrudgingly. It is but right that
you, who have read this work in the Greek should point out to others the design of my
translation—unless indeed, you feel that in some respects I have not observed the right
method of rendering the original. You are, I believe well aware that there are two Greek
editions of this work of Clement, his Recognitions; that there are two sets of books, which
in some few cases differ from each other though the bulk of the narrative is the same. For
instance, the last part of the work, that which gives an account of the transformation of Simon
Magus, exists in one of these, while in the other it is entirely absent. On the other hand there
are some things, such as the dissertation on the unbegotten and the begotten God, and a
few others, which, though they are found in both editions, are, to say the least of them,
beyond my understanding; and these I have preferred to leave others to deal with rather
than to present them in an inadequate manner. As to the rest, I have taken pains not to
swerve, even in the slightest degree from either the sense or the diction; and this, though it
makes the expression less ornate, renders it more faithful.</p>
<p>There is a letter in which this same Clement writing to James the Lord’s brother, gives
an account of the death of Peter, and says that he has left him as his successor, as ruler and
teacher of the church; and further incorporates a whole scheme of ecclesiastical government.
This I have not prefixed to the work, both because it is later in point of time, and because
it has been previously translated and published by me. Nevertheless, there is a point which
would perhaps seem inconsistent with facts were I to place the translation of it in this work,
but which I do not consider to involve an impossibility. It is this. Linus and Cletus were
Bishops of the city of Rome before Clement. How then, some men ask, can Clement in his
letter to James say that Peter passed over to him his position as a church-teacher.3436 The
explanation of this point, as I understand, is as follows. Linus and Cletus were, no doubt,
Bishops in the city of Rome before Clement, but this was in Peter’s life-time; that is, they
took charge of the episcopal work, while he discharged the duties of the apostolate. He is
known to have done the same thing at Cæsarea; for there, though he was himself on the
spot, yet he had at his side Zacchæus whom he had ordained as Bishop. Thus we may see
how both things may be true; namely how they stand as predecessors of Clement in the list
of Bishops, and yet how Clement after the death of Peter became his successor in the
teacher’s chair. But it is time that we should pay attention to the beginning of Clement’s
own narrative, which he addresses to James the Lord’s brother.</p>

<p>I know that, just as the sheep come gladly when their own shepherd calls them, so in
matters of religion men attend most gladly to the admonitions of a teacher who speaks their
own language: and therefore, my very dear Apronianus, when that pious lady who is my
daughter but now your sister in Christ, had laid her commands on me to compose for her
a treatise of such a nature that its understanding should not require any great effort, I
translated into Latin in a very open and plain style the work of Xystus, who is said to be the
same man who at Rome is called Sixtus, and who gained the glory of being both bishop and
martyr. I think that, when she reads this, she will find it expressed with such brevity that a
vast meaning is unfolded in each several line, with such power that a sentence only a line
long would suffice for a whole life’s training, and yet with such simplicity that one who
looked over the shoulder of a girl as she read it might question whether I were not quite
weak in intellect. And the whole work is so concise that it would be possible for her never
to let go of it. The entire book would hardly be bigger than the finger ring of one of our
ancestors. And indeed it seems but right that one who has learnt through the word of God
to count as dross the ornaments of the world should now receive at my hands by way of
ornament a necklace of the word and of wisdom. For the present let this little book serve
for a ring and be kept constantly in the hands: but it will not be long before it will penetrate
into the treasure house and be wholly laid up in the heart, and bring forth from its innermost
chamber the germs of instruction and of a participation in all good works. I have added
further a few choice sayings addressed by a pious father to his son, but all so succinct that
the whole of this little work may rightly be called in Greek the Enchiridion3437 or in Latin

<p>Addressed to Chromatius, Bishop of Aquileia, a.d. 401.</p>
<p>(For the occasion of writing, and the date, see Prolegomena, p. 412.)</p>
<p>It is the custom, they say, of skilful physicians, when they perceive that some epidemic
disease is near at hand in one of our cities, to provide some kind of medicine, whether solid
or liquid, which men may use as a preventative to defend themselves from the destruction
which is hanging over them. You have imitated this method of the doctors, my venerable
Father, Chromatius, at the moment when the gates of Italy were broken through by Alaric
the commander of the Goths, and thus a disease and plague poured in upon us, which made
havoc of the fields and cattle and men throughout the land. You then sought a remedy
against the cruelty and destruction, so that the minds of men which were languishing might
be drawn away from the contagion of the prevailing malady, and might preserve their balance
through an interest in better pursuits. This you have done by enjoining on me the task of
translating into Latin the ecclesiastical history which was written in the Greek language by
that most learned man, Eusebius of Cæsarea. You thought that the mind of those who heard
it read to them might be so held fast by it that, in its eager desire for the knowledge of past
events, it might to some extent become oblivious of their actual sufferings. I tried to excuse
myself from the task, as being, through my weakness unequal to it, and as having in the
lapse of years lost the use of the Latin tongue. But I reflected that your commands were not
to be divaricated from your position in the Apostolic order. For, at the time when the multitude
in the desert were hungering, and the Lord said to his Apostles, “Give ye them to eat,”
Philip who was one of them instead of bringing out the loaves which were hid in the wallet
of the Apostles, said that there was a little lad there who had five loaves and two fishes. He
knew that the exhibition of the divine virtue would be none the less brilliant if the ministry
of some of the little ones were used in its fulfilment. He modestly excused his action by
adding, “What are these among so many?” So that the divine power might be more conspicuous
through the difficult and desperate circumstances in which it acted. I felt that, since you
were a scion of the Apostolic order, you had possibly acted in remembrance of Philip’s example,
and that, when you saw that the time was come for the multitudes to be fed, you had
engaged the services of a little lad who might be able to contribute, twice told, the five
loaves3439 which he had received, but who further, to fulfil the Gospel type, might add two
<note type="footnote">3439 That is, the ten books of Eusebius’ History.</note>

<pb n="1452"/>
small fishes3440 which he had captured by his own efforts. I have therefore made the attempt
to execute what you had ordered, having the assurance that the deficiency of my inexperience
would be excused on account of the authority of him who gave the command.</p>
<p>I must point out the course I have taken in reference to the tenth book of this work. As
it stands in the Greek, it has little to do with the process of events. All but a small part of it
is taken up with discussions tending to the praise of particular Bishops, and adds nothing
to our knowledge of facts. I have therefore left out all this superfluous matter; and, whatever
in it belonged to genuine history I have added to the ninth book, with which I have made
his history close. The tenth and eleventh books I have myself compiled, partly from the
traditions of the former generation, partly from facts within my own memory; and these I
have added to the previous books, like the two fishes to the loaves. If you bestow your approval
and benediction upon them, I shall have a sure confidence that they will suffice for
the multitude. The work as now completed contains the events from the Ascension of the
Saviour to the present time; my own two books those from the days of Constantine when
the persecution came to an end on to the death of the Emperor Theodosius.</p>
<p>The following note occurs at the end of the ninth book of Rufinus’ Latin Version of
Eusebius.</p>
<p>Thus far Eusebius has given us the record of the history. As to the subsequent events,
as they have followed on up to the present time, as I have found them recorded in the writings
of the last generation, or so far as they are covered by my own knowledge, I will add them,
obeying, as best I may, in this point also the commands of our father in God.3441</p>

<head>Rufinus’ Preface to the Translation of Origen’s Commentary
on Psalms 36, 37, and 38.</head>
<p>Addressed to Apronianus,3442 either at Rome or at Aquileia, between a.d. 398 and
a.d. 407.</p>
<p>The whole exposition of the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Psalms is
ethical in its character, being designed to enforce more correct methods of life; and teaches
at one time the way of conversion and repentance, at another that of purification and of
progress. I have therefore thought it well to translate it into Latin for you, my dearest son
Apronianus, having first arranged it in nine of the short sermons which are called in Greek
Homilies, and incorporated it into one whole; and thus this discourse which in all its parts
aims at the correction and the advancement of the moral life, is collected into a single volume.
My translation will at all events be of use so far as to put the reader without effort in possession
of the meaning of the author, which is here fully laid open, and to bring home to him
the simplicity of life which he enjoins with clearness of thought and in simple words; and
thus the voice of prophecy may reach not men alone but also god-fearing women, and lend
subtlety to the minds of the simple. Yet I fear that pious lady, who is my daughter but your
sister in Christ, may think that she owes me no thanks for my work if it brings her nothing
but puzzling thoughts and thorny questions: for the human body could hardly hold together
if divine providence had formed it of bones and muscles alone without blending with them
the ease and grace of the softer tissues.</p>

<head>Rufinus’ Preface to the Translation of Origen’s Commentary
on the Epistle to the Romans.</head>
<p>Addressed to Heraclius at Aquileia about a.d. 407.</p>
<p>My intention was to press the shore of the quiet land in the little bark in which I was
sailing, and to draw out a few little fishes from the pools of Greece: but you have compelled
me, brother Heraclius, to give my sails to the wind and go forth into the deep sea; you persuade
me to leave the work which lay before me in the translation of the homilies written
by the Man of Adamant3443 in his old age, and to open to you the fifteen volumes in which
he discussed the Epistle of Paul to the Romans. In these books, while he aims at representing
the Apostle’s thoughts, he is carried away into a sea of such depth that one who follows him
into it may well be afraid of being drowned in the greatness of his thoughts as in the vastness
of the waves. Then also you do not consider this, that my breath is but scanty for filling a
grand trumpet of eloquence like his. And beyond all these difficulties is this, that the books
themselves have been interpolated. In almost all the libraries (I grant that no one can tell
how it happened) some of the volumes are absent from the body of the work; and to supply
these, and to restore the continuity of the work in the Latin version is beyond my talent, but
would be, as you must know when you make your demand, a special gift of God. You add,
however, so that nothing may be wanting to the labour I am undertaking, that I had better
abbreviate this whole body of fifteen volumes, which in the Greek reaches to the length of
forty thousand lines or more, and bring it within moderate compass. Your injunctions are
hard indeed, and might be thought to be imposed by one who did not care to consider what
the burden of such a work must be. I will, however, attempt it, hoping that through your
prayers, and the favour of the Lord, what seems impossible to man may become possible.
But we will now, if you please, listen to the Preface which Origen himself prefixes to the
work on which he was entering.</p>

himself, and to form part of his real name.</note>

<head>The Peroration of Rufinus Appended to His Translation
of Origen’s Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans.</head>
<p>Addressed to Heraclius at Aquileia, probably about 407.</p>
<p>A satisfactory conclusion has now, I trust, been reached of the Commentary on the
Epistle to the Romans, the writing of which has been a work of very great labour and time.
I confess, my most loving brother Heraclius, that in the attempt to respond to your request
I have almost forgotten the precept; “Do not lift a burden above your strength.” Even in the
other translations of Origen’s works into Latin, which were made because you earnestly requested
it, or rather exacted it as a journeyman’s task, the labour was very great; for I made
it my object to supplement what Origen spoke extempore in the lecture room of the church;
for his aim there was the application of the subject for the sake of edification rather than
the exposition of the text. This I have done in the case of the Homilies, and the short lectures
on Genesis and Exodus, and especially in those on the book of Leviticus, where he spoke in
a hortatory manner, whereas my translation takes the form of an exposition. This duty of
supplying what was wanted I took up because I thought that the practice of agitating questions
and then leaving them unsolved, which he frequently adopts in his homiletic mode of
speaking, might prove distasteful to the Latin reader. The works upon Jesus Nave3444 and
the book of Judges and the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Psalms, I translated
simply as I found them, with no great labour. While then in the other cases which I have
mentioned above, I employed much labour in supplying what Origen had omitted, in this
work on the Epistle to the Romans the labour that fell on me for the causes described in the
Preface was immense and full of complexity. But there will have been nothing but pleasure
in these labours, provided only that my experience in other cases, of ill-disposed minds requiting
my toils and vigils with contumely, be not repeated and that I do not gain for my
studies the reward of detraction and for my labour a conspiracy to ruin me. For in dealing
with these men I have to undergo a new form of accusation. They say to me; When you
write these things, in which are found many pieces the composition of which is due to
yourself, you should place your own name in the title, and let it run thus: ‘The books of
Rufinus’ commentary on (for instance) the Epistle to the Romans;’ for so, they say, in the
case of profane writers, the name in the title is not that of the Greek author who is translated
but of the Latin author who translates him. But all this complaisance, by which the works
are ascribed to me, is caused not by love to me but by hatred to the author. I am much more
observant of my conscience than of my reputation; it may be apparent that I have added
<note type="footnote">3444 Joshua.</note>

<pb n="1456"/>
some things to supply what was wanting; and that I have abbreviated what was too lengthy;
but to steal the title from the man who laid the foundations on which the building has been
reared is what I cannot think right. It must be, I grant, in the discretion of the reader, when
he has examined the work, to ascribe the work to any one he thinks right; but my intention
has been not to seek the applause of students but the good of those who wish to be edified.</p>
<p>I shall turn next to the work which was long ago imposed upon me but now is demanded
with still greater vehemence by the Bishop Gaudentius, namely to turn into Latin the books
called the Recognition of Clement the Bishop of Rome, the successor and companion of the
Apostles. In this work I well know that, to judge by the ordinary rule, I shall have labour
upon labour. In this case I will do what my friends desire, I will put my own name in the
title of the work, though I shall have that of the author also. It shall be called Rufinus’s
Clement. If the Lord enable me to fulfil this task, I shall afterwards return to that which you
desire, and say something, God willing, on the books of Numbers or of Deuteronomy (for
this alone is wanting to my whole work on the Heptateuch): or else I shall write what I can,
the Lord being my guide, on the remaining epistles of the Apostle Paul.</p>

<head>Preface to Origen’s Homilies on Numbers.</head>
<p>Addressed to Ursacius.3445 Written in 410.3446</p>
<p>My dear brother, I might rightly address you in the words of the blessed master, “You
do well, dearest Donatus, in reminding me of this;” for I well remember my promise that I
would collect all that Adamantius wrote in his old age on the Law of Moses, and translate
it into Latin for the use of our people. But, as he says, the season was not seasonable for the
fulfilment of my promise, but was full of storm and confusion. How can the pen move freely
when a man is in fear of the missiles of the enemy, when he has before his eyes the devastation
of cities and country, when he has to fly from dangers of the sea, and there is no safety even
in exile? As you yourself saw, the Barbarian was within sight of us; he had set fire to the city
of Rhegium, and our only protection against him was the very narrow sea which separates
the soil of Italy from Sicily. In such a position, what leisure could there be for writing, and
especially for translating, a work in which one’s duty is not to develop one’s own opinions
but to express those of another? However, when there was a quiet night, and our minds
were relieved from the fear of an attack by the enemy, and we got at least some little leisure
for thought, I set to work, as a solace from our troubles, and to relieve the burden of our
pilgrimage, to gather into one and arrange all that Origen had written on the book of
Numbers, whether in the way of homilies or in writings such as are called Excerpts,3447 and
to translate them into the Roman tongue. You urged me to do this, Ursacius, and aided me
with all your might, indeed, so eager were you, that you thought the youth who acted as
secretary too slow in the execution of his office. I wish, however, to point out to you, my
brother, that the object of this method of studying scripture is not to deal with each clause
separately, as you find done in commentaries, but to open up a path for the understanding,
so that the reader may not be made negligent, but as it is written3448 may “stir up his own
spirit” and draw out the meaning, and, when he has heard the good word, may add to it by
his own wisdom. In this way I have tried to give all the expositions which you desired; and
now of all the writings that I have found upon the Law the short comments upon Deuteronomy
alone are wanting; these, if God so will, and if he restores my eye-sight, I hope to add
to the body of the work. Indeed, my very loving son Pinianus, whose truly Christian company
I have joined in their flight because of my delight in their chaste conversation, requires yet

other tasks from me. But do you and he join your prayers that the Lord may be present with
us, and may give peace in our time, and shew mercy to those who are in trouble, and make
our work fruitful for the edification of the reader.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of
Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. This volume specifically contains
the works of Eusebius--a fourth century bishop and Church historian. The Nicene and Post-
Nicene Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive
and illuminating texts from some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain
instructive and fruitful even today!</p>

<head>ANF07. Fathers of the Third and Fourth Centuries:
Lactantius,Venantius, Asterius,Victorinus, Dionysius,
Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions, Homily,
and Liturgies</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids,MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. This
volume has Church fathers from both the third and fourth
century. These writings were heavily influential on the early
Church, and for good reason, as they are inspirational and
encouraging. These volumes also come with many useful
notes, providing the reader with new levels of understanding.
Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome
addition to one's reading list.

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE</head>
<p>The genius of Lactantius suffers a sad transformation when unclothed of vernacular
and stripped of the idiomatic graces of his style. But the intelligent reader will be sure to
compare this translation with the Latinity of the original, and to recur to it often for the
enjoyment of its charming rhetoric, and of the high sentiment it so nobly enforces and adorns.
This volume will be the favourite of the series with many. The writings of the Christian
Tully alone make up more than half of its contents; and it is supremely refreshing to reach,
at last, an author who chronicles the triumph of the Gospel1 over “Herod and Pontius Pilate;”
over the heathen in their “rage,” and the people in their “vain imaginings;” over “the kings
of the earth who stood up, and the rulers who were gathered together against the Lord and
against His Christ.”</p>
<p>I love the writings of Lactantius, and two of his sayings are always uppermost when I
recall his name. They touch me like plaintive but inspiring music. Let me quote them entire:
2—</p>
<p>1. “Si vita est optanda sapienti profecto nullam aliam ob causam vivere optaverim, quam
ut aliquid efficiam quod vita dignum sit.”</p>
<p>2. “Satis me vixisse arbitrabor, et officium hominis implesse, si labor meus aliquos
homines ab erroribus liberatos, ad iter coeleste direxerit.”</p>
<p>The Minor Writers to be found in this volume are not unworthy of their place. They
are chiefly valuable as an appendix to preceding volumes,3 and illustrative of their contents.</p>
<p>But this series is enriched beyond its original by the Bryennios Manuscript and the
completed form of the pseudo-Clementine Epistle, edited by Professor Riddle. The same
hand has annotated the Apostolic Constitutions, so called; and the student has in his brief
but learned notes all the light which has been shed by modern scholarship on these invaluable
relics of antiquity, since the days of the truly illustrious Bishop Beveridge. These, and the
liturgical pseudepigraphic treasures of early Christianity I have gathered here, to distinguish
them from the mere Apocrypha, which will largely make up the one remaining volume of
the series.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Compare Merivale, Conversion of the Roman Empire, p. 8, ed. New York, 1866.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 De Opificio Dei, cap. xxi. p. 395, ed. Basil, 1521.</note>
<note type="footnote">3 Thus the Apocalyptic comments of Victorinus must be compared with those of Commodian and Hippolytus,
Dionysius with his namesake of Alexandria, Asterius with Caius, etc.</note>

<pb n="4"/>
<p>Of the Liturgies, I have said what seemed necessary as an introduction, in the proper
place.4 They are debased by mediæval alloy. In their English dress, and in the nudity of their
appearance, without adequate notes and elucidations, they are therefore far from attractive
specimens of liturgical literature. But it would have been beyond my province to say much
where the original editors have said nothing, and I have contented myself with such comments
only as seemed requisite to remind the student how to “take forth the precious from
the vile.”</p>

<p>[a.d. 260—330.] Reaching, at last, the epoch of Constantine, perhaps the reader will
share my own feelings, as those of—
<lg>
<l>“One who long, in thickets and in brakes</l>
<l>Entangled, winds now this way, and now that,</l>
<l>His devious course uncertain, seeking home,</l>
<l>But finds at last a greensward smooth and large,</l>
<l>Courageous, and refreshed for future toil.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>How strange it seems, after three centuries since John the Baptist suffered, to gain a
moment when kings are not actually persecuting Christ in His servants!</p>
<p>How marvelous the change must have been in the experience of the primitive faithful;
the Roman Emperor not ashamed of Jesus, and setting up the cross on the standards of his
legions! Tertullian, De Fuga, and the troubles of Cyprian about The Lapsed, are matters of
the past. As in a moment, God has changed the world for His people, and their perils become
as suddenly reversed. The world’s favor begins to be the trial of faith, as its hatred before.
The mild contemplative attitude of the Church at this period is something surprising. It
accepts with little exultation this miracle of the Master; but so long has it been habituated
to persecution, that it finds much of its discipline, and not less of its prevailing spirit, neutralized
by its very triumph. No more the martyr’s heroic testimony and his crown beyond
this life; no such call for the celibate as had been enforced before in tomes of the Christian
literature; and what need now of Antony’s invitation to the desert and the cell? But, on the
other hand, these ascetic forms of heroic faith were all that were now left to minister to the
martyr-spirit, and to perpetuate the habits enforced upon the early believers. The hermitage
and the monastery assumed a new attractiveness, and became dear to sentiment, as to
principle before. We must not be surprised, then, at the tendencies of the age now rapidly
developed; but let us rejoice for a moment in the times of refreshing from the Lord now at
last vouchsafed to that “little flock” to which He had promised the kingdom.</p>
<p>The “conversion of Constantine,” as it is called, introduced the most marvelous revolution
in human empire, in practical thought, and in the laws and manners of mankind, ever
known in the history of the world. It is amazing how little the men of the epoch itself glorified
their own introduction to “marvelous light,” and how very little the Church has left us, to

<pb n="7"/>
tell the story of its emotions when first it found itself at rest from fiery persecutions, or when
came forth from the Emperor the Edict of Milan for the legal observance of “the Day of the
Sun.”1 What a day that Easter was, when, emerging from the catacombs and other dens and
caves of the earth, the Church herself seemed as one risen from the dead!</p>
<p>We may be sure there were tears of joy and warm embraces among kindred long torn
asunder by their common exposures to fire and sword. We cannot imagine, indeed, all, that
was in the hearts of those Christian families that now kept holyday together in the face of
the world, and sang fearlessly in holy places their anthem, “Christ is risen from the dead.”
But a moment’s thought we ought to give, as we pass into a stage of history entirely fresh
and new, to the power of God thus manifested. The miracle thus wrought by the ascended
Christ needs no aid from the supposed “vision of Constantine” to make it a supernatural
exhibition of His glory who is “King of kings and Lord of lords.”</p>
<p>Arnobius wrote to the minds of perplexed Pilates asking “What is truth” in a new spirit,
and not indisposed to wash their own hands of the blood of Jesus, though not prepared to
believe and be baptized. His pupil finds a better sort of Pilate in the Emperor and in his
period. Constantine is a pagan still at heart, but he is convinced of the truth that Christ has
a kingdom “not of this world;” and he must have this credit, above the Antonines, that he
recognized in the Chris tians not only his best and most loyal subjects, but men of a character
altogether superior2 to that of the heathen, who had so long been the councillors of the
empire. He was one, also, who accepted “the logic of events,” and who came to terms with
the inevitable in time to turn it to his own advantage.</p>
<p>I think Constantine had read the Apologies addressed to the Antonines3 by Justin Martyr,
and was at first disposed only to accept the plea for Christians so far forth as Justin had
urged it. Going so far, he was led beyond his positive convictions to measures of policy
which identified him with the Church. That the Church was distrustful of him, and doubted
how long the Imperial favor might be relied upon, is also apparent. This doubt accounts, in
some degree, for the great moderation of the Church in accepting benefits from him, and
in withholding notes of triumph. She instinctively foresaw Julians in the way, and expected
reactionary periods. She forbore to baptize the Emperor, and encouraged his disposition to
postpone. It was as when “the wolf of Benjamin” was introduced to the disciples: “they were
afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.”</p>
<p>Lactantius, moved, perhaps, by Hosius or Eusebius, undertakes the instruction of the
Emperor, while seeming only to copy the example of Justin writing to Antoninus Pius. The
Institutes, it is true, had been begun at an earlier date; but he economizes, for a new purpose,
<note type="footnote">1 He borrows from Justin, vol. i. note 1, p. 186.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 e.g., Thomas, vol. vi. p. 158.</note>

<pb n="8"/>
the material, in which, perhaps, he had only purposed to follow up the work of his teacher,
in language better fitted to the polite, for refuting heathenism. I cannot doubt that he aimed,
in pure Latinity, to win the Emperor and his court to a deeper and purer conviction of divine
truth: to more than a feeble and possibly superstitious idea that it was useless to contend
with it, and that the gods of the empire were impotent to protect themselves against Christian
progress and its masterly exposures of their shame and nothingness.</p>
<p>In language which has given him the title of the Christian Cicero, Lactantius employs
Cicero himself as a defender of the truth; correcting him, indeed, and overruling his mistakes,
rebuking his pusillanimity, and justly censuring him, (1) in philosophy, for declaring it no
rule of action, however ennobling its precepts; and (2) in religion, for not venturing to
profess conclusions to which his reasonings necessarily tend. All this is admirably adapted
to carry on the work of Christian Fathers and Apologists under the change of times. He and
Arnobius furnish but a supplement to the real teachers of the Church, and are not to be always
depended on in statements of doctrine. They write like earnest converts, but not like theologians;
yet, although their loose expressions are often inconsistent one with another, it is
manifest that their design is to support orthodoxy as it had been defined by abler expounders.
I think the large respect which Lactantius pays to the testimony of the Sibyls was addressed
to the class with which he had to deal. Constantine was greatly influenced by such testimonies,
if we may judge from his own liberal quotations4 and his comments on the Pollio of Virgil,
to which, as a Christian oracle, our author may have introduced him. In short, the day had
come in which it could no longer be said with strict propriety of phrase, “Not many mighty,
not many noble, are called;” and Lactantius accepted, as his mission, the enforcement, before
such a class, of despised truths which the great had persecuted in vain for centuries. He drew
them thus to the conclusion that God had indeed “chosen the foolish things of the world to
confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are
mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea,
and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are.” Such was the prophecy of St.
Paul, and the Labarum uplifted by Cæsar’s legions proclaimed the fulfillment.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that Lactantius was of heathen parentage, and was converted late in
life. To his eternal honor he was not a “fair-weather Christian,” but boldly confessed the
faith amid the fires of the last and most terrible of the great persecutions. Its probable date
suggests that his treatise on the persecutors may have been a far-reaching effort to dissuade
the Cæsars of a later age from trying to restore “the gods to Latium.” I confess my own
partiality to our author, and the interest with which his writings continue to impress me,
even now. In youth (Consule Planco) I brought to his pages an enthusiastic appreciation of
the genius which had adorned the very dawn of Christian civilization by works of literary

merit not inferior to those of the Augustan age. The crabbed Latinity of Tertullian has
charms, indeed, of its own sort: it was the shaggy raiment of the ascetic and the confessor,
“always bearing about in his own body the dying of the Lord Jesus.” It befitted the age and
the man, and those awful realities with which Christians had then to deal. Not words, but
things, were their one concern. It is pleasant to find, however, that Christianity is not incapable
of meeting all sorts and conditions of men; and Lactantius’ was doubtless the instrument
of Providence in bearing the testimony of Jesus, “even before kings,” in language which
promised to Roman letters the new and commanding development imparted to its language
by Christianity, which has made it imperishable, and more truly “eternal” than Rome itself.</p>
<p>The following is the Introductory Notice of the reverend translator:5—</p>
<p>Lactantius has always held a very high place among the Christian Fathers, not only on
account of the subject-matter of his writings, but also on account of the varied erudition,
the sweetness of expression, and the grace and elegance of style, by which they are characterized.
It appears, therefore, more remarkable that so little is known with certainty respecting
his personal history. We are unable to fix with precision either the place or time of his birth,
and even his name has been the subject of much discussion. It is known that he was a pupil
of Arnobius, who gave lectures in rhetoric at Sicca in Africa. Hence it has been supposed
that Lactantius was a native of Africa, while others have maintained that he was born in
Italy, and that his birthplace probably was Firmium, on the Adriatic. He was probably born
about the middle of the third century, since he is spoken of as far advanced in life about a.d.
315. He is usually denominated “Lucius Cælius Firmianus Lactantius;” but the name Cæcilius
is sometimes substituted for Cælius, and it is uncertain whether Firmianus is a family name
or a local6 designation. Some have even supposed that be received the name of Lactantius
from the milky softness of his style.</p>
<p>He attained to great eminence as a teacher of rhetoric, and his fame far outstripped the
reputation of his master Arnobius. Such, indeed, was his celebrity, that he was invited by
the Emperor Diocletian to settle at Nicomedia, and there practise his art. He appears, however
to have met with so little success in that city, as to have been reduced to extreme indigence.
Abandoning his profession as a pleader, he devoted himself to literary composition. It was
probably at this period that he embraced the Christian faith, and we may perhaps be justified
in supposing some connection between his poverty and his change of religion.7 He was af-

terwards called to settle in Gaul, probably about a.d. 315, and the Emperor Constantine
entrusted to him the education of his son Crispus. He is believed to have died at Trèves
about a.d. 325.</p>
<p>His principal work is The Christian Institutions, or an Introduction to True Religion, in
seven books, designed to supersede8 the less complete treatises of Minucius Felix, Tertullian,
and Cyprian. In these books, each of which has a distinct title, and constitutes a separate
essay, he demonstrates the falsehood of the pagan religion, shows the vanity of the heathen
philosophy, and undertakes the defense of the Christian religion against its adversaries. He
also sets forth the nature of righteousness, gives instructions concerning the true worship
of God, and treats of the punishment of the wicked, and the reward of the righteous in
everlasting happiness.</p>
<p>To the Institutions is appended an epitome dedicated to Pentadius. The authorship of
this abridgment has been questioned in modem times; but it is expressly assigned to
Lactantius by Hieronymus. The greater part of the work was wanting in the earlier editions,
and it was not until the beginning of the eighteenth century that it was discovered nearly
entire.9</p>
<p>The treatise on The Anger of God is directed mainly against the tenets of the Epicureans
and Stoics, who maintained that the deeds of men could produce no emotions of pleasure
or anger in the Deity. Lactantius holds that the love of the good necessarily implies the
hatred of evil; and that the tenets of these philosophers, as tending to overthrow the doctrine
of future rewards and punishments, are subversive of the principles of true religion.</p>
<p>In the treatise on The Workmanship of God, or The Formation of Man, the author dwells
upon the wonderful construction of the human frame, and the adaptation of means to ends
therein displayed, as proofs of the wisdom and goodness of God. The latter part of the book
contains speculations concerning the nature and origin of the soul.</p>
<p>In the treatise10 on the Deaths of Persecutors, an argument for the truth of the Christian
religion is derived from the fact, that those emperors who had been most distinguished as
persecutors of the Christians, were special objects of divine vengeance.</p>
<p>To these treatises are usually appended some poetical works which have been attributed
to Lactantius, but it is very questionable whether any of them were really written by him.</p>
<p>The poem on the Phoenix appears to be of a comparatively modern date.</p>
<p>That on Easter11 is believed to have been composed by Venantius Honorianus
Clementianus Fortunatus in the sixth century.</p>

<note type="footnote">11 De Paschâ.</note>

<pb n="11"/>
<p>The poem on the Passion of the Lord, though much admired both in its language and
style of thought, bears the impress of a later age.12</p>
<p>There is also a collection of A Hundred Enigmas,13 which has been attributed to
Lactantius; but there is good reason to suppose that they are not the production of his pen.
Heumann endeavored to prove that Symposium is the title of the work, and that no such
person as Symposius14 ever existed. But this opinion is untenable. It is true that Hieronymus
speaks of Lactantius as the author of a Symposium, but there are no grounds for supposing
that the work was of a light and trifling character: it was probably a serious dialogue.</p>
<p>The style of Lactantius has been deservedly praised for the dignity, elegance, and clearness
of expression by which it is characterized, and which have gained for him the appellation
of the Christian Cicero. His writings everywhere give evidence of his varied and extensive
erudition, and contain much valuable information respecting the systems of the ancient
philosophers. But his claims as a theologian are open to question; for he holds peculiar
opinions on many points, and he appears more successful as an opponent of error than as
a maintainer of the truth. Lactantius has been charged with a leaning to Manicheism,15 but
the charge appears to be unfounded.</p>
<p>The translation has been made from Migne’s edition, from which most of the notes
have been taken. The quotations from Virgil have been given in the words of Conington’s
translation,16 and those from Lucretius in the words of Munro.</p>

<pb n="14"/>
<head>PREFACE.—OF WHAT GREAT VALUE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH IS AND
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.</head>
<p>Men of great and distinguished talent, when they had entirely devoted themselves to
learning, holding in contempt all actions both private and public, applied to the pursuit of
investigating the truth whatever labour could be bestowed upon it; thinking it much more
excellent to investigate and know the method of human and divine things, than to be entirely
occupied with the heaping up of riches or the accumulation of honours. For no one can be
made better or more just by these things, since they are frail and earthly, and pertain to the
adorning of the body only. Those men were indeed most deserving of the knowledge of the
truth, which they so greatly desired to know, that they even preferred it to all things. For it
is plain that some gave up their property, and altogether abandoned the pursuit of pleasures,
that, being disengaged and without impediment, they might follow the simple truth, and it
alone. And so greatly did the name and authority of the truth prevail with them, that they
proclaimed that the reward of the greatest good was contained in it. But they did not obtain
the object of their wish, and at the same time lost their labour and industry; because the
truth, that is the secret of the Most High God, who created all things, cannot be attained by
our own ability and perceptions. Otherwise there would be no difference between God and
man, if human thought could reach to the counsels and arrangements of that eternal majesty.
And because it was impossible that the divine method of procedure should become known
to man by his own efforts, God did not suffer man any longer to err in search of the light
of wisdom, and to wander through inextricable darkness without any result of his labour,
but at length opened his eyes, and made the investigation of the truth His own gift, so that
He might show the nothingness of human wisdom, and point out to man wandering in error
the way of obtaining immortality.</p>
<p>But since few make use of this heavenly benefit and gift, because the truth lies hidden
veiled in obscurity; and it is either an object of contempt to the learned because it has not
suitable defenders, or is hated by the unlearned on account of its natural severity, which the
nature of men inclined to vices cannot endure: for because there is a bitterness mingled with
virtues, while vices are seasoned with pleasure, offended by the former and soothed by the
latter, they are borne headlong, and deceived by the appearance of good things, they embrace
evils for goods,—I have believed that these errors should be encountered, that both the
learned may be directed to true wisdom, and the unlearned to true religion. And this profession
is to be thought much better, more useful and glorious, than that of oratory, in which
being long engaged, we trained young men not to virtue, but altogether to cunning
wickedness.17 Certainly we shall now much more rightly discuss respecting the heavenly
precepts, by which we may be able to instruct the minds of men to the worship of the true
<note type="footnote">17 [This, St. Augustine powerfully illustrates. See Confessions, lib. iii. cap 3. Note also Ib., lib. ix. cap 5.]</note>

majesty. Nor does he deserve so well respecting the affairs of men, who imparts the knowledge
of speaking well, as he who teaches men to live in piety and innocence; on which account
the philosophers were in greater glory among the Greeks than the orators. For they, the
philosophers, were considered teachers of right living, which is far more excellent, since to
speak well belongs only to a few, but to live well belongs to all. Yet that practice in fictitious
suits has been of great advantage to us, so that we are now able to plead the cause of truth
with greater copiousness and ability of speaking; for although the truth may be defended
without eloquence, as it often has been defended by many, yet it needs to be explained, and
in a measure discussed, with distinctness and elegance of speech, in order that it may flow
with greater power into the minds of men, being both provided with its own force, and adorned
with the brilliancy of speech.</p>
</div>

<pb n="16"/>
<head>CHAP. I.— OF RELIGION AND WISDOM.</head>
<p>We undertake, therefore, to discuss religion and divine things. For if some of the greatest
orators, veterans as it were of their profession, having completed the works of their pleadings,
at last gave themselves up to philosophy, and regarded that as a most just rest from their
labours, if they tortured their minds in the investigation of those things which could not be
found out, so that they appear to have sought for themselves not so much leisure as occupation,
and that indeed with much greater trouble than in their former pursuit; how much
more justly shall I betake myself as to a most safe harbour, to that pious, true, and divine
wisdom, in which all things are ready for utterance, pleasant to the hearing, easy to be understood,
honourable to be undertaken! And if some skilful men and arbiters of justice
composed and published Institutions of civil law, by which they might lull the strifes and
contentions of discordant citizens, how much better and more rightly shall we follow up in
writing the divine Institutions, in which we shall not speak about rain-droppings, or the
turning of waters, or the preferring of claims, but we shall speak of hope, of life, of salvation,
of immortality, and of God, that we may put an end to deadly superstitions and most disgraceful
errors.</p>
<p>And we now commence this work under the auspices of your name, O mighty Emperor
Constantine, who were the first of the Roman princes to repudiate errors, and to acknowledge
and honour the majesty of the one and only true God.18 For when that most happy day had
shone upon the world, in which the Most High God raised you to the prosperous height of
power, you entered upon a dominion which was salutary and desirable for all, with an excellent
beginning, when, restoring justice which had been overthrown and taken away, you
expiated the most shameful deed of others. In return for which action God will grant to you
happiness, virtue, and length of days, that even when old you may govern the state with the
same justice with which you began in youth, and may hand down to your children the
guardianship of the Roman name, as you yourself received it from your father. For to the
wicked, who still rage against the righteous in other parts of the world, the Omnipotent will
also repay the reward of their wickedness with a severity proportioned to its tardiness; for
as He is a most indulgent Father towards the godly, so is He a most upright Judge against
the ungodly. And in my desire to defend His religion and divine worship, to whom can I
rather appeal, whom can I address, but him by whom justice and wisdom have been restored
to the affairs of men?</p>
<p>Therefore, leaving the authors of this earthly philosophy, who bring forward nothing
certain, let us approach the right path; for if I considered these to be sufficiently suitable
guides to a good life, I would both follow them myself, and exhort others to follow them.
<note type="footnote">18 [It thrills me to compare this modest tribute of Christian confidence, with Justin’s unheeded appeal to
the Stoical Antonine.]</note>

<pb n="17"/>
But since they disagree among one another with great contention, and are for the most part
at variance with themselves, it is evident that their path is by no means straightforward;
since they have severally marked out distinct ways for themselves according to their own
will, and have left great confusion to those who are seeking for the truth. But since the truth
is revealed from heaven to us who have received the mystery of true religion, and since we
follow God, the teacher of wisdom and the guide to truth, we call together all, without any
distinction either of sex or of age, to heavenly pasture. For there is no more pleasant food
for the soul than the knowledge of truth,19 to the maintaining and explaining of which we
have destined seven books, although the subject is one of almost boundless and immeasurable
labour; so that if any one should wish to dilate upon and follow up these things to their full
extent, he would have such an exuberant supply of subjects, that neither books would find
any limit, nor speech any end. But on this account we will put together all things briefly,
because those things which we are about to bring forward are so plain and lucid, that it
seems to be more wonderful that the truth appears so obscure to men, and to those especially
who are commonly esteemed wise, or because men will only need to be trained by us,—that
is, to be recalled from the error in which they are entangled to a better course of life.</p>
<p>And if, as I hope, we shall attain to this, we will send them to the very fountain of
learning, which is most rich and abundant, by copious draughts of which they may appease
the thirst conceived within, and quench their ardour. And all things will be easy, ready of
accomplishment, and clear to them, if only they are not annoyed at applying patience in
reading or hearing to the perception of the discipline of wisdom.20 For many, pertinaciously
adhering to vain superstitions, harden themselves against the manifest truth, not so much
deserving well of their religions, which they wrongly maintain, as they deserve ill of themselves;
who, when they have a straight path, seek devious windings; who leave the level
ground that they may glide over a precipice; who leave the light, that, blind and enfeebled,
they may lie in darkness. We must provide for these, that they may not fight against themselves,
and that they may be willing at length to be freed from inveterate errors. And this
they will assuredly do if they shall at any time see for what purpose they were born; for this
is the cause of their perverseness,—namely, ignorance of themselves: and if any one, having
gained the knowledge of the truth, shall have shaken off this ignorance, he will know to
what object his life is to be directed, and how it is to be spent. And I thus briefly define the
sum of this knowledge, that neither is any religion to be undertaken without wisdom, nor
any wisdom to be approved of without religion.</p>

<head>CHAP. II.—THAT THERE IS A PROVIDENCE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN.</head>
<p>Having therefore undertaken the office of explaining the truth, I did not think it so necessary
to take my commencement from that inquiry which naturally seems the first,
whether there is a providence which consults for all things, or all things were either made
or are governed by chance; which sentiment was introduced by Democritus, and confirmed
by Epicurus. But before them, what did Protagoras effect, who raised doubts respecting the
gods; or Diagoras afterwards, who excluded them; and some others, who did not hold the
existence of gods, except that there was supposed to be no providence? These, however,
were most vigorously opposed by the other philosophers, and especially by the Stoics, who
taught that the universe could neither have been made without divine intelligence, nor
continue to exist unless it were governed by the highest intelligence. But even Marcus Tullius,
although he was a defender of the Academic system, discussed at length and on many occasions
respecting the providence which governs affairs, confirming the arguments of the
Stoics, and himself adducing many new ones; and this he does both in all the books of his
own philosophy, and especially in those which treat of the nature of the gods.21</p>
<p>And it was no difficult task, indeed, to refute the falsehoods of a few men who entertained
perverse sentiments by the testimony of communities and tribes, who on this one point had
no disagreement. For there is no one so uncivilized, and of such an uncultivated disposition,
who, when he raises his eyes to heaven, although he knows not by the providence of what
God all this visible universe is governed, does not understand from the very magnitude of
the objects, from their motion, arrangement, constancy, usefulness, beauty, and temperament,
that there is some providence, and that that which exists with wonderful method must have
been prepared by some greater intelligence. And for us, assuredly, it is very easy to follow
up this part as copiously as it may please us. But because the subject has been much agitated
among philosophers, and they who take away providence appear to have been sufficiently
answered by men of sagacity and eloquence, and because it is necessary to speak, in different
places throughout this work which we have undertaken, respecting the skill of the divine
providence, let us for the present omit this inquiry, which is so closely connected with the
other questions, that it seems possible for us to discuss no subject, without at the same time
discussing the subject of providence.</p>

<pb n="19"/>
<head>CHAP. III.—WHETHER THE UNIVERSE IS GOVERNED BY THE POWER OF ONE
GOD OR OF MANY.</head>
<p>Let the commencement of our work therefore be that inquiry which closely follows and
is connected with the first: Whether the universe is governed by the power of one God or
of many. There is no one, who possesses intelligence and uses reflection, who does not understand
that it is one Being who both created all things and governs them with the same
energy by which He created them. For what need is there of many to sustain the government
of the universe? unless we should happen to think that, if there were more than one, each
would possess less might and strength. And they who hold that there are many gods, do
indeed effect this; for those gods must of necessity be weak, since individually, without the
aid of the others, they would be unable to sustain the government of so vast a mass. But
God, who is the Eternal Mind, is undoubtedly of excellence, complete and perfect in every
part. And if this is true, He must of necessity be one. For power or excellence, which is
complete, retains its own peculiar stability. But that is to be regarded as solid from which
nothing can be taken away, that as perfect to which nothing can be added.</p>
<p>Who can doubt that he would be a most powerful king who should have the government
of the whole world? And not without reason, since all things which everywhere exist would
belong to him, since all resources from all quarters would be centred in him alone. But if
more than one divide the government of the world, undoubtedly each will have less power
and strength, since every one must confine himself within his prescribed portion.22 In the
same manner also, if there are more gods than one, they will be of less weight, others having
in themselves the same power. But the nature of excellence admits of greater perfection in
him in whom the whole is, than in him in whom there is only a small part of the whole. But
God, if He is perfect, as He ought to be, cannot but be one, because He is perfect, so that all
things may be in Him. Therefore the excellences and powers of the gods must necessarily
be weaker, because so much will be wanting to each as shall be in the others; and so the
more there are, so much the less powerful will they be. Why should I mention that this
highest power and divine energy is altogether incapable of division? For whatever is capable
of division must of necessity be liable to destruction also. But if destruction is far removed
from God, because He is incorruptible and eternal, it follows that the divine power is incapable
of division. Therefore God is one, if that which admits of so great power can be nothing
else: and yet those who deem that there are many gods, say that they have divided their
functions among themselves; but we will discuss all these matters at their proper places. In
the meantime, I affirm this, which belongs to the present subject. If they have divided their
functions among themselves, the matter comes back to the same point, that any one of them
is unable to supply the place of all. He cannot, then, be perfect who is unable to govern all
<note type="footnote">22 [A hint to Cæsar himself, the force of which began soon after very sorely to be felt in the empire.]</note>

<pb n="20"/>
things while the others are unemployed. And so is comes to pass, that for the government
of the universe there is more need of the perfect excellence of one than of the imperfect
powers of many. But he who imagines that so great a magnitude as this cannot be governed
by one Being, is deceived. For he does not comprehend how great are the might and power
of the divine majesty, if he thinks that the one God, who had power to create the universe,
is also unable to govern that which He has created. But if he conceives in his mind how great
is the immensity of that divine work, when before it was nothing, yet that by the power and
wisdom of God it was made out of nothing—a work which could only be commenced and
accomplished by one—he will now understand that that which has been established by one
is much more easily governed by one.</p>
<p>Some one may perhaps say that so immense a work as that of the universe could not
even have been fabricated except by many. But however many and however great he may
consider them,—whatever magnitude, power, excellence, and majesty he may attribute to
the many,—the whole of that I assign to one, and say that it exists in one: so that there is in
Him such an amount of these properties as can neither be conceived nor expressed. And
since we fail in this subject, both in perception and in words—for neither does the human
breast admit the light of so great understanding, nor is the mortal tongue capable of explaining
such great subjects—it is right that we should understand and say this very same thing.
I see, again, what can be alleged on the other hand, that those many gods are such as we
hold the one God to be. But this cannot possibly be so, because the power of these gods individually
will not be able to proceed further, the power of the others meeting and hindering
them. For either each must be unable to pass beyond his own limits, or, if he shall have
passed beyond them, he must drive another from his boundaries. They who believe that
there are many gods, do not see that it may happen that some may be opposed to others in
their wishes, from which circumstance disputing and contention would arise among them;
as Homer represented the gods at war among themselves, since some desired that Troy
should be taken, others opposed it. The universe, therefore, must be ruled by the will of one.
For unless the power over the separate parts be referred to one and the same providence,
the whole itself will not be able to exist; since each takes care of nothing beyond that which
belongs peculiarly to him, just as warfare could not be carried on without one general and
commander. But if there were in one army as many generals as there are legions, cohorts,
divisions,23 and squadrons, first of all it would not be possible for the army to be drawn out
in battle array, since each would refuse the peril; nor could it easily be governed or controlled,
because all would use their own peculiar counsels, by the diversity of which they would inflict
more injury than they would confer advantage. So, in this government of the affairs of
<note type="footnote">23 Cunei; properly, soldiers arranged in the shape of wedge.</note>

<pb n="21"/>
nature, unless there shall be one to whom the care of the whole is referred, all things will be
dissolved and fall to decay.</p>
<p>But to say that the universe is governed by the will of many, is equivalent to a declaration
that there are many minds in one body, since there are many and various offices of the
members, so that separate minds may be supposed to govern separate senses; and also the
many affections, by which we are accustomed to be moved either to anger, or to desire, or
to joy, or to fear, or to pity, so that in all these affections as many minds may be supposed
to operate; and if any one should say this, he would appear to be destitute even of that very
mind, which is one. But if in one body one mind possesses the government of so many
things, and is at the same time occupied with the whole, why should any one suppose that
the universe cannot be governed by one, but that it can be governed by more than one? And
because those maintainers of many gods are aware of this, they say that they so preside over
separate offices and parts, that there is still one chief ruler. The others, therefore, on this
principle, will not be gods, but attendants and ministers, whom that one most mighty and
omnipotent appointed to these offices, and they themselves will be subservient to his authority
and command. If, therefore, all are not equal to one another, all are not gods; for that which
serves and that which rules cannot be the same. For if God is a title of the highest power,
He must be incorruptible, perfect, incapable of suffering, and subject to no other being;
therefore they are not gods whom necessity compels to obey the one greatest God. But because
they who hold this opinion are not deceived without cause, we will presently lay open
the cause of this error. Now, let us prove by testimonies the unity of the divine power.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—THAT THE ONE GOD WAS FORETOLD EVEN BY THE PROPHETS.</head>
<p>The prophets, who were very many, proclaim and declare the one God; for, being filled
with the inspiration of the one God, they predicted things to come, with agreeing and harmonious
voice. But those who are ignorant of the truth do not think that these prophets are
to be believed; for they say that those voices are not divine, but human. Forsooth, because
they proclaim one God, they were either madmen or deceivers. But truly we see that their
predictions have been fulfilled, and are in course of fulfilment daily; and their foresight,
agreeing as it does to one opinion, teaches that they were not under the impulse of madness.
For who possessed of a frenzied mind would be able, I do not say to predict the future, but
even to speak coherently? Were they, therefore, who spoke such things deceitful? What was
so utterly foreign to their nature as a system of deceit, when they themselves restrained
others from all fraud? For to this end were they sent by God, that they should both be heralds
of His majesty, and correctors of the wickedness of man.</p>
<p>Moreover, the inclination to feign and speak falsely belongs to those who covet riches,
and eagerly desire gains,—a disposition which was far removed from those holy men. For
they so discharged the office entrusted to them, that, disregarding all things necessary for
the maintenance of life, they were so far from laying up store for the future, that they did
not even labour for the day, content with the unstored food which God had supplied; and
these not only had no gains, but even endured torments and death. For the precepts of
righteousness are distasteful to the wicked, and to those who lead an unholy life. Wherefore
they, whose sins were brought to light and forbidden, most cruelly tortured and slew them.
They, therefore, who had no desire for gain, had neither the inclination nor the motive for
deceit. Why should I say that some of them were princes, or even kings,24 upon whom the
suspicion of covetousness and fraud could not possibly fall, and yet they proclaimed the
one God with the same prophetic foresight as the others?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="23"/>
<head>CHAP. V.—OF THE TESTIMONIES OF POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS.</head>
<p>But let us leave the testimony of prophets, lest a proof derived from those who are universally
disbelieved should appear insufficient. Let us come to authors, and for the demonstration
of the truth let us cite as witnesses those very persons whom they are accustomed
to make use of against us,—I mean poets and philosophers. From these we cannot fail in
proving the unity of God; not that they had ascertained the truth, but that the force of the
truth itself is so great, that no one can be so blind as not to see the divine brightness
presenting itself to his eyes. The poets, therefore, however much they adorned the gods in
their poems, and amplified their exploits with the highest praises, yet very frequently confess
that all things are held together and governed by one spirit or mind. Orpheus, who is the
most ancient of the poets, and coeval with the gods themselves,—since it is reported that
he sailed among the Argonauts together with the sons of Tyndarus and Hercules,—speaks
of the true and great God as the first-born,25 because nothing was produced before Him,
but all things sprung from Him. He also calls Him Phanes26 because when as yet there was
nothing He first appeared and came forth from the infinite. And since he was unable to
conceive in his mind the origin and nature of this Being, he said that He was born from the
boundless air: “The first-born, Phaethon, son of the extended air;” for he had nothing more
to say. He affirms that this Being is the Parent of all the gods, on whose account He framed
the heaven, and provided for His children that they might have a habitation and place of
abode in common: “He built for immortals an imperishable home.” Thus, under the guidance
of nature and reason, he understood that there was a power of surpassing greatness which
framed heaven and earth. For he could not say that Jupiter was the author of all things, since
he was born from Saturn; nor could he say that Saturn himself was their author, since it was
reported that he was produced from the heaven; but he did not venture to set up the heaven
as the primeval god, because he saw that it was an element of the universe, and must itself
have had an author. This consideration led him to that first-born god, to whom he assigns
and gives the first place.</p>
<p>Homer was able to give us no information relating to the truth, for he wrote of human
rather than divine things. Hesiod was able, for he comprised in the work of one book the
generation of the gods; but yet he gave us no information, for he took his commencement
not from God the Creator, but from chaos, which is a confused mass of rude and unarranged
matter; whereas he ought first to have explained from what source, at what time, and in
what manner, chaos itself had begun to exist or to have consistency. Without doubt, as all
things were placed in order, arranged, and made by some artificer, so matter itself must of
necessity have been formed by some being. Who, then, made it except God, to whose power
<note type="footnote">25 πρωτόγονον.</note>
<note type="footnote">26 φάνητα, the appearer.</note>

<pb n="24"/>
all things are subject? But he shrinks from admitting this, while he dreads the unknown
truth. For, as he wished it to appear, it was by the inspiration of the Muses that he poured
forth that song on Helicon; but he had come after previous meditation and preparation.</p>
<p>Maro was the first of our poets to approach the truth, who thus speaks respecting the
highest God, whom he calls Mind and Spirit:27—
<lg>
<l>“Know first, the heaven, the earth, the main,</l>
<l>The moon’s pale orb, the starry train,</l>
<l>Are nourished by a Soul,</l>
<l>A Spirit, whose celestial flame</l>
<l>Glows in each member of the frame,</l>
<l>And stirs the mighty whole.”</l>
</lg>
And lest any one should happen to be ignorant what that Spirit was which had so much
power, he has declared it in another place, saying:28 “For the Deity pervades all lands, the
tracts of sea and depth of heaven; the flocks, the herds, and men, and all the race of beasts,
each at its birth, derive their slender lives from Him.”</p>
<p>Ovid also, in the beginning of his remarkable work, without any disguising of the name,
admits that the universe was arranged by God, whom he calls the Framer of the world, the
Artificer of all things.29 But if either Orpheus or these poets of our country had always
maintained what they perceived under the guidance of nature, they would have comprehended
the truth, and gained the same learning which we follow.30</p>
<p>But thus far of the poets. Let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is of greater
weight, and their judgment more to be relied on, because they are believed to have paid attention,
not to matters of fiction, but to the investigation of the truth. Thales of Miletus,
who was one of the number of the seven wise men, and who is said to have been the first of
all to inquire respecting natural causes, said that water was the element from which all things
were produced, and that God was the mind which formed all things from water. Thus he
placed the material of all things in moisture; he fixed the beginning and cause of their production
in God. Pythagoras thus defined the being of God, “as a soul passing to and fro,
and diffused through all parts of the universe, and through all nature, from which all living
creatures which are produced derive their life.” Anaxagoras said that God was an infinite
mind, which moves by its own power. Antisthenes maintained that the gods of the people

<pb n="25"/>
were many, but that the God of nature was one only; that is, the Fabricator of the whole
universe. Cleanthes and Anaximenes assert that the air is the chief deity; and to this opinion
our poet has assented:31 “Then almighty father Æther descends in fertile showers into the
bosom of his joyous spouse; and great himself, mingling with her great body, nourishes all
her offspring.” Chrysippus speaks of God as a natural power endowed with divine reason,
and sometimes as a divine necessity. Zeno also speaks of Him as a divine and natural law.
The opinion of all these, however uncertain it is, has reference to one point,—to their
agreement in the existence of one providence. For whether it be nature, or æther, or reason,
or mind, or a fatal necessity, or a divine law, or if you term it anything else, it is the same
which is called by us God. Nor does the diversity of titles prove an obstacle, since by their
very signification they all refer to one object. Aristotle, although he is at variance with
himself, and both utters and holds sentiments opposed to one another, yet upon the whole
bears witness that one Mind presides over the universe. Plato, who is judged the wisest of
all, plainly and openly maintains the rule of one God; nor does he name Him Æther, or
Reason, or Nature, but, as He truly is, God, and that this universe, so perfect and wonderful,
was fabricated by Him. And Cicero, following and imitating him in many instances, fre-
quently acknowledges God, and calls Him supreme, in those books which he wrote on the
subject of laws; and he adduces proof that the universe is governed by Him, when he argues
respecting the nature of the gods in this way: “Nothing is superior to God: the world must
therefore be governed by Him. Therefore God is obedient or subject to no nature; consequently
He Himself governs all nature.” But what God Himself is he defines in his Consolation:
32 “Nor can God Himself, as He is comprehended by us, be comprehended in any
other way than as a mind free and unrestrained, far removed from all mortal materiality,
perceiving and moving all things.”</p>
<p>How often, also, does Annæus Seneca, who was the keenest Stoic of the Romans, follow
up with deserved praise the supreme Deity! For when he was discussing the subject of premature
death, he said “You do not understand the authority and majesty of your Judge, the
Ruler of the world, and the God of heaven and of all gods, on whom those deities which we
separately worship and honour are dependent.” Also in his Exhortations: “This Being, when
He was laying the first foundations of the most beautiful fabric, and was commencing this
work, than which nature has known nothing greater or better, that all things might serve
their own rulers, although He had spread Himself out through the whole body, yet He produced
gods as ministers of His kingdom.” And how many other things like to our own
writers did he speak on the subject of God! But these things I put off for the present, because
they are more suited to other parts of the subject. At present it is enough to demonstrate
<note type="footnote">31 Virg., Georg., ii. 325–327.</note>
<note type="footnote">32 [See (Sigonius) p. 144, ed. Paris, 1818.]</note>

<pb n="26"/>
that men of the highest genius touched upon the truth, and almost grasped it, had not custom,
infatuated by false opinions, carried them back; by which custom they both deemed that
there were other gods, and believed that those things which God made for the use of man,
as though they were endowed with perception, were to be held and worshipped as gods.</p>

<pb n="27"/>
<head>CHAP. VI.—OF DIVINE TESTIMONIES, AND OF THE SIBYLS AND THEIR
PREDICTIONS.</head>
<p>Now let us pass to divine testimonies; but I will previously bring forward one which
resembles a divine testimony, both on account of its very great antiquity, and because he
whom I shall name was taken from men and placed among the gods. According to Cicero,
Caius Cotta the pontiff, while disputing against the Stoics concerning superstitions, and the
variety of opinions which prevail respecting the gods, in order that he might, after the custom
of the Academics, make everything uncertain, says that there were five Mercuries; and
having enumerated four in order, says that the fifth was he by whom Argus was slain, and
that on this account he fled into Egypt, and gave laws and letters to the Egyptians. The
Egyptians call him Thoth; and from him the first month of their year, that is, September,
received its name among them. He also built a town, which is even now called in Greek
Hermopolis (the town of Mercury), and the inhabitants of Phenæ honour him with religious
worship. And although he was a man, yet he was of great antiquity, and most fully imbued
with every kind of learning, so that the knowledge of many subjects and arts acquired for
him the name of Trismegistus.33 He wrote books, and those in great numbers, relating to
the knowledge of divine things, in which be asserts the majesty of the supreme and only
God, and makes mention of Him by the same names which we use—God and Father. And
that no one might inquire His name, he said that He was without name, and that on account
of His very unity He does not require the peculiarity of a name. These are his own words:
“God is one, but He who is one only does not need a name; for He who is self-existent is
without a name.” God, therefore, has no name, because He is alone; nor is there any need
of a proper name, except in cases where a multitude of persons requires a distinguishing
mark, so that you may designate each person by his own mark and appellation. But God,
because He is always one, has no peculiar name.</p>
<p>It remains for me to bring forward testimonies respecting the sacred responses and
predictions, which are much more to be relied upon. For perhaps they against whom we
are arguing may think that no credence is to be given to poets, as though they invented fictions,
nor to philosophers, inasmuch as they were liable to err, being themselves but men.
Marcus Varro, than whom no man of greater learning ever lived, even among the Greeks,
much less among the Latins, in those books respecting divine subjects which he addressed
to Caius Cæsar the chief pontiff, when he was speaking of the Quindecemviri,34 says that
the Sibylline books were not the production of one Sibyl only, but that they were called by
<note type="footnote">33 [See vol. i. p. 289 note 2, this series.]</note>
<note type="footnote">34 The Quindecemviri were the fifteen men to whom the care of the Sibylline books was entrusted. At first
two (Duumviri) were appointed. The number was afterwards increased to ten, and subsequently to fifteen. It
appears probable that this last change was made by Sulla.</note>

<pb n="28"/>
one name Sibylline, because all prophetesses were called by the ancients Sibyls, either from
the name of one, the Delphian priestess, or from their proclaiming the counsels of the gods.
For in the Æolic dialect they used to call the gods by the word Sioi, not Theoi; and for
counsel they used the word bule, not boule;—and so the Sibyl received her name as though
Siobule.35 But he says that the Sibyls were ten in number, and he enumerated them all under
the writers, who wrote an account of each: that the first was from the Persians, and of her
Nicanor made mention, who wrote the exploits of Alexander of Macedon;—the second of
Libya, and of her Euripides makes mention in the prologue of the Lamia;—the third of
Delphi, concerning whom Chrysippus speaks in that book which he composed concerning
divination;—the fourth a Cimmerian in Italy, whom Nævius mentions in his books of the
Punic war, and Piso in his annals;—the fifth of Erythræa, whom Apollodorus of Erythræa
affirms to have been his own countrywoman, and that she foretold to the Greeks when they
were setting out for Ilium, both that Troy was doomed to destruction, and that Homer
would write falsehoods;—the sixth of Samos, respecting whom Eratosthenes writes that he
had found a written notice in the ancient annals of the Samians. The seventh was of Cumæ,
by name Amalthæa, who is termed by some Herophile, or Demophile, and they say that she
brought nine books to the king Tarquinius Priscus, and asked for them three hundred
philippics, and that the king refused so great a price, and derided the madness of the woman;
that she, in the sight of the king, burnt three of the books, and demanded the same price for
those which were left; that Tarquinias much more considered the woman to be mad; and
that when she again, having burnt three other books, persisted in asking the same price, the
king was moved, and bought the remaining books for the three hundred pieces of gold: and
the number of these books was afterwards increased, after the rebuilding of the Capitol;
because they were collected from all cities of Italy and Greece, and especially from those of
Erythræa, and were brought to Rome, under the name of whatever Sibyl they were. Further,
that the eighth was from the Hellespont, born in the Trojan territory, in the village of
Marpessus, about the town of Gergithus; and Heraclides of Pontus writes that she lived in
the times of Solon and Cyrus;—the ninth of Phrygia, who gave oracles at Ancyra;—the tenth
of Tibur, by name Albunea, who is worshipped at Tibur as a goddess, near the banks of the
river Anio, in the depths of which her statue is said to have been found, holding in her hand
a book. The senate transferred her oracles into the Capitol.</p>
<p>The predictions of all these Sibyls36 are both brought forward and esteemed as such,
except those of the Cumæan Sibyl, whose books are concealed by the Romans; nor do they
consider it lawful for them to be inspected by any one but the Quindecemviri. And there are

<pb n="29"/>
separate books the production of each, but because these are inscribed with the name of the
Sibyl they are believed to be the work of one; and they are confused, nor can the productions
of each be distinguished and assigned to their own authors, except in the case of the Erythræan
Sibyl, for she both inserted her own true name in her verse, and predicted that she
would be called Erythræan, though she was born at Babylon. But we also shall speak of the
Sibyl without any distinction, wherever we shall have occasion to use their testimonies. All
these Sibyls, then, proclaim one God, and especially the Erythræan, who is regarded among
the others as more celebrated and noble; since Fenestella, a most diligent writer, speaking
of the Quindecemviri, says that, after the rebuilding of the Capitol, Caius Curio the consul
proposed to the senate that ambassadors should be sent to Erythræ to search out and bring
to Rome the writings of the Sibyl; and that, accordingly, Publius Gabinius, Marcus Otacilius,
and Lucius Valerius were sent, who conveyed to Rome about a thousand verses written out
by private persons. We have shown before that Varro made the same statement. Now in
these verses which the ambassadors brought to Rome, are these testimonies respecting the
one God:—
<lg>
<l>1. “One God, who is alone, most mighty, uncreated.”</l>
</lg>
This is the only supreme God, who made the heaven, and decked it with lights.
<lg>
<l>2. “But there is one only God of pre-eminent power, who made the heaven, and
sun, and stars, and moon, and fruitful earth, and waves of the water
of the sea.”</l>
</lg>
And since He alone is the framer of the universe, and the artificer of all things of which it
consists or which are contained in it, it testifies that He alone ought to be worshipped:—
<lg>
<l>3. “Worship Him who is alone the ruler of the world, who alone was and is from
age to age.”</l>
</lg>
Also another Sibyl, whoever she is, when she said that she conveyed the voice of God to
men, thus spoke:—
<lg>
<l>4. “I am the one only God, and there is no other God.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>I would now follow up the testimonies of the others, were it not that these are sufficient,
and that I reserve others for more befitting opportunities. But since we are defending the
cause of truth before those who err from the truth and serve false religions, what kind of

<pb n="30"/>
proof ought we to bring forward37 against them, rather than to refute them by the testimonies
of their own gods?</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—CONCERNING THE TESTIMONIES OF APOLLO AND THE GODS.</head>
<p>Apollo, indeed, whom they think divine above all others, and especially prophetic, giving
responses at Colophon,—I suppose because, induced by the pleasantness of Asia, he had
removed from Delphi,—to some one who asked who He was, or what God was at all, replied
in twenty-one verses, of which this is the beginning:—
<lg>
<l>“Self-produced, untaught, without a mother, unshaken,</l>
<l>A name not even to be comprised in word, dwelling in fire,</l>
<l>This is God; and we His messengers are a slight portion of God.”</l>
</lg>
Can any one suspect that this is spoken of Jupiter, who had both a mother and a name? Why
should I say that Mercury, that thrice greatest, of whom I have made mention above, not
only speaks of God as “without a mother,” as Apollo does, but also as “without a father,”
because He has no origin from any other source but Himself? For He cannot be produced
from any one, who Himself produced all things. I have, as I think, sufficiently taught by arguments,
and confirmed by witnesses, that which is sufficiently plain by itself, that there is
one only King of the universe, one Father, one God.</p>
<p>But perchance some one may ask of us the same question which Hortensius asks in
Cicero: If God is one only,38 what solitude can be happy? As though we, in asserting that
He is one, say that He is desolate and solitary. Undoubtedly He has ministers, whom we call
messengers. And that is true, which I have before related, that Seneca said in his Exhortations
that God produced ministers of His kingdom. But these are neither gods, nor do they wish
to be called gods or to be worshipped, inasmuch as they do nothing but execute the command
and will of God. Nor, however, are they gods who are worshipped in common, whose
number is small and fixed. But if the worshippers of the gods think that they worship those
beings whom we call the ministers of the Supreme God, there is no reason why they should
envy us who say that there is one God, and deny that there are many. If a multitude of gods
delights them, we do not speak of twelve, or three hundred and sixty-five as Orpheus did;
but we convict them of innumerable errors on the other side, in thinking that they are so
few. Let them know, however, by what name they ought to be called, lest they do injury to
the true God, whose name they set forth, while they assign it to more than one. Let them
believe their own Apollo, who in that same response took away from the other gods their
name, as he took away the dominion from Jupiter. For the third verse shows that the ministers
of God ought not to be called gods, but angels. He spoke falsely respecting himself, indeed;
for though he was of the number of demons, he reckoned himself among the angels of God,
and then in other responses he confessed himself a demon. For when he was asked how he
wished to be supplicated, he thus answered:—
<note type="footnote">38 [1 John iv. 8. The Divine Triad “is Love.”]</note>

<pb n="32"/>
<lg>
<l>“O all-wise, all-learned, versed in many pursuits, hear, O demon.”</l>
</lg>
And so, again, when at the entreaty of some one he uttered an imprecation against the
Sminthian Apollo, he began with this verse:—
<lg>
<l>“O harmony of the world, bearing light, all-wise demon.”</l>
</lg>
What therefore remains, except that by his own confession he is subject to the scourge of
the true God and to everlasting punishment? For in another response he also said:—
<lg>
<l>“The demons who go about the earth and about the sea</l>
<l>Without weariness, are subdued beneath the scourge of God.”</l>
</lg>
We speak on the subject of both in the second book. In the meantime it is enough for us,
that while he wishes to honour and place himself in heaven, he has confessed, as the nature
of the matter is, in what manner they are to be named who always stand beside God.</p>
<p>Therefore let men withdraw themselves from errors; and laying aside corrupt superstitions,
let them acknowledge their Father and Lord, whose excellence cannot be estimated,
nor His greatness perceived, nor His beginning comprehended. When the earnest attention
of the human mind and its acute sagacity and memory has reached Him, all ways being, as
it were, summed up and exhausted,39 it stops, it is at a loss, it fails; nor is there anything
beyond to which it can proceed. But because that which exists must of necessity have had
a beginning, it follows that since there was nothing before Him, He was produced from
Himself before all things. Therefore He is called by Apollo “self-produced,” by the Sibyl
“self-created,” “uncreated,” and “unmade.” And Seneca, an acute man, saw and expressed
this in his Exhortations. “We,” he said, “are dependent upon another.” Therefore we look
to some one to whom we owe that which is most excellent in us. Another brought us into
being, another formed us; but God of His own power made Himself.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—THAT GOD IS WITHOUT A BODY, NOR DOES HE NEED
DIFFERENCE OF SEX FOR PROCREATION.</head>
<p>It is proved, therefore, by these witnesses, so numerous and of such authority, that the
universe is governed by the power and providence of one God, whose energy and majesty
Plato in the Timæus asserts to be so great, that no one can either conceive it in his mind, or
give utterance to it in words, on account of His surpassing and incalculable power. And
then can any one doubt whether any thing can be difficult or impossible for God, who by
His providence designed, by His energy established, and by His judgment completed those
works so great and wonderful, and even now sustains them by His spirit, and governs them
by His power, being incomprehensible and unspeakable, and fully known to no other than
Himself? Wherefore, as I often reflect on the subject of such great majesty, they who worship
the gods sometimes appear so blind, so incapable of reflection, so senseless, so little removed
from the mute animals, as to believe that those who are born from the natural intercourse
of the sexes could have had anything of majesty and divine influence; since the Erythræan
Sibyl says: “It is impossible for a God to be fashioned from the loins of a man and the womb
of a woman.” And if this is true, as it really is, it is evident that Hercules, Apollo, Bacchus,
Mercury, and Jupiter, with the rest, were but men, since they were born from the two sexes.
But what is so far removed from the nature of God as that operation which He Himself assigned
to mortals for the propagation of their race, and which cannot be affected without
corporeal substance?</p>
<p>Therefore, if the gods are immortal and eternal, what need is there of the other sex,
when they themselves do not require succession, since they are always about to exist? For
assuredly in the case of mankind and the other animals, there is no other reason for difference
of sex and procreation and bringing forth, except that all classes of living creatures, inasmuch
as they are doomed to death by the condition of their mortality, may be preserved by mutual
succession. But God, who is immortal, has no need of difference of sex, nor of succession.
Some one will say that this arrangement is necessary, in order that He may have some to
minister to Him, or over whom He may bear rule. What need is there of the female sex,
since God, who is almighty, is able to produce sons without the agency of the female? For
if He has granted to certain minute creatures40 that they
<lg>
<l>“Should gather offspring for themselves with their mouth from leaves and sweet
herbs,”</l>
</lg>
why should any one think it impossible for God Himself to have offspring except by union
with the other sex? No one, therefore, is so thoughtless as not to understand that those were
mere mortals, whom the ignorant and foolish regard and worship as gods. Why, then, some
<note type="footnote">40 [The bees, according to Virgil, Georg., iv. 199.]</note>

<pb n="34"/>
one will say, were they believed to be gods? Doubtless because they were very great and
powerful kings; and since, on account of the merits of their virtues, or offices, or the arts
which they discovered, they were beloved by those over whom they had ruled, they were
consecrated to lasting memory. And if any one doubts this, let him consider their exploits
and deeds, the whole of which both ancient poets and historians have handed down.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF HERCULES AND HIS LIFE AND DEATH.41</head>
<p>Did not Hercules, who is most renowned for his valour, and who is regarded as an
Africanus among the gods, by his debaucheries, lusts, and adulteries, pollute the world,
which he is related to have traversed and purified? And no wonder, since he was born from
an adulterous intercourse with Alcmena.</p>
<p>What divinity could there have been in him, who, enslaved to his own vices, against all
laws, treated with infamy, disgrace, and outrage, both males and females? Nor, indeed, are
those great and wonderful actions which he performed to be judged such as to be thought
worthy of being attributed to divine excellence. For what! is it so magnificent if he overcame
a lion and a boar; if he shot down birds with arrows; if he cleansed a royal stable; if he
conquered a virago, and deprived her of her belt; if he slew savage horses together with their
master? These are the deeds of a brave and heroic man, but still a man; for those things
which he overcame were frail and mortal. For there is no power so great, as the orator says,
which cannot be weakened and broken by iron and strength. But to conquer the mind, and
to restrain anger, is the part of the bravest man; and these things he never did or could do:
for one who does these things I do not compare with excellent men, but I judge him to be
most like to a god.</p>
<p>I could wish that he had added something on the subject of lust, luxury, desire, and arrogance,
so as to complete the excellence of him whom he judged to be like to a god. For he
is not to be thought braver who overcomes a lion, than he who overcomes the violent wild
beast shut up within himself, viz. anger; or he who has brought down most rapacious birds,
than he who restrains most covetous desires; or he who subdues a warlike Amazon, than
he who subdues lust, the vanquisher42 of modesty and fame; or he who cleanses a stable
from dung, than he who cleanses his heart from vices, which are more destructive evils because
they are peculiarly his own, than those which might have been avoided and guarded
against. From this it comes to pass, that he alone ought to be judged a brave man who is
temperate, moderate, and just. But if any one considers what the works of God are, he will
at once judge all these things, which most trifling men admire, to be ridiculous. For they
measure them not by the divine power of which they are ignorant, but by the weakness of
their own strength. For no one will deny this, that Hercules was not only a servant to
Eurystheus, a king, which to a certain extent may appear honourable, but also to an unchaste
woman, Omphale, who used to order him to sit at her feet, clothed with her garments, and
executing an appointed task. Detestable baseness! But such was the price at which pleasure
was valued. What! some one will say, do you think that the poets are to be believed? Why

should I not think so? For it is not Lucilius who relates these things, or Lucian, who spared
not men nor gods, but these especially who sting the praises of the gods.</p>
<p>Whom, then, shall we believe, if we do not credit those who praise them? Let him who
thinks that these speak falsely produce other authors on whom we may rely, who may teach
us who these gods are, in what manner and from what source they had their origin, what is
their strength, what their number, what their power, what there is in them which is admirable
and worthy of adoration—what mystery, in short, more to be relied on, and more true. He
will produce no such authorities. Let us, then, give credence to those who did not speak for
the purpose of censure, but to proclaim their praise. He sailed, then, with the Argonauts,
and sacked Troy, being enraged with Laomedon on account of the reward refused to him,
by Laomedon, for the preservation of his daughter, from which circumstance it is evident
at what time he lived. He also, excited by rage and madness, slew his wife, together with his
children. Is this he whom men consider a god? But his heir Philoctetes did not so regard
him, who applied a torch to him when about to be burnt, who witnessed the burning and
wasting of his limbs and sinews, who buried his bones and ashes on Mount OEta, in return
for which office he received his arrows.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF THE LIFE AND ACTIONS OF ÆSCULAPIUS, APOLLO, NEPTUNE,
MARS, CASTOR AND POLLUX, MERCURY AND BACCHUS.</head>
<p>What other action worthy of divine honours, except the healing of Hippolytus, did
Æsculapius perform, whose birth also was not without disgrace to Apollo? His death was
certainly more renowned, because he earned the distinction of being struck with lightning
by a god. Tarquitius, in a dissertation concerning illustrious men, says that he was born of
uncertain parents, exposed, and found by some hunters; that he was nourished by a dog,
and that, being delivered to Chiron, he learned the art of medicine. He says, moreover, that
he was a Messenian, but that he spent some time at Epidaurus. Tully also says that he was
buried at Cynosuræ. What was the conduct of Apollo, his father? Did he not, on account
of his impassioned love, most disgracefully tend the flock of another, and build walls for
Laomedon, having been hired together with Neptune for a reward, which could with impunity
be withheld from him? And from him first the perfidious king learned to refuse to carry out
whatever contract he had made with gods. And he also, while in love with a beautiful boy,
offered violence to him, and while engaged in play, slew him.</p>
<p>Mars, when guilty of homicide, and set free from the charge of murder by the Athenians
through favour, lest he should appear to be too fierce and savage, committed adultery with
Venus. Castor and Pollux, while they are engaged in carrying off the wives of others, ceased
to be twin-brothers. For Idas, being excited with jealousy on account of the injury, transfixed
one of the brothers with his sword. And the poets relate that they live and die alternately: so
that they are now the most wretched not only of the gods, but also of all mortals, inasmuch
as they are not permitted to die once only. And yet Homer, differing from the other poets,
simply records that they both died. For when he represented Helen as sitting by the side of
Priam on the walls of Troy, and recognising all the chieftains of Greece, but as looking in
vain for her brothers only, he added to his speech a verse of this kind:—
<lg>
<l>“Thus she; unconscious that in Sparta they,</l>
<l>Their native land, beneath the sod were laid.”</l>
</lg>
What did Mercury, a thief and spendthrift, leave to contribute to his fame, except the memory
of his frauds? Doubtless he was deserving of heaven, because he taught the exercises of the
palæstra, and was the first who invented the lyre.43 It is necessary that Father Liber should
be of chief authority, and of the first rank in the senate of the gods, because he was the only
one of them all, except Jupiter, who triumphed, led an army, and subdued the Indians. But
that very great and unconquered Indian commander was most shamefully overpowered by
love and lust. For, being conveyed to Crete with his effeminate retinue, he met with an un-
<note type="footnote">43 [See vol. v. p. 43, and note, p. 46, this series.]</note>

<pb n="38"/>
chaste woman on the shore; and in the confidence inspired by his Indian victory, he wished
to give proof of his manliness, lest he should appear too effeminate. And so he took to
himself in marriage that woman, the betrayer of her father, and the murderer of her brother,
after that she had been deserted and repudiated by another husband; and he made her Libera,
and with her ascended into heaven.</p>
<p>What was the conduct of Jupiter, the father of all these, who in the customary prayer is
styled44 Most Excellent and Great? Is he not, from his earliest childhood, proved to be impious,
and almost a parricide, since he expelled his father from his kingdom, and banished
him, and did not await his death though he was aged and worn out, such was his eagerness
for rule? And when he had taken his father’s throne by violence and arms, he was attacked
with war by the Titans, which was the beginning of evils to the human race; and when these
had been overcome and lasting peace procured, he spent the rest of his life in debaucheries
and adulteries. I forbear to mention the virgins whom he dishonoured. For that is wont to
be judged endurable. I cannot pass by the cases of Amphitryon and Tyndarus, whose houses
he filled to overflowing with disgrace and infamy. But he reached the height of impiety and
guilt in carrying off the royal boy. For it did not appear enough to cover himself with infamy
in offering violence to women, unless he also outraged his own sex. This is true adultery,
which is done against nature. Whether he who committed these crimes can be called Greatest
is a matter of question, undoubtedly he is not the Best; to which name corrupters, adulterers,
and incestuous persons have no claim; unless it happens that we men are mistaken in
terming those who do such things wicked and abandoned, and in judging them most deserving
of every kind of punishment. But Marcus Tullius was foolish in upbraiding Caius
Verres with adulteries, for Jupiter, whom he worshipped, committed the same; and in upbraiding
Publius Clodius with incest with his sister, for he who was Best and Greatest had
the same person both as sister and wife.</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF THE ORIGIN, LIFE, REIGN, NAME AND DEATH OF JUPITER, AND
OF SATURN AND URANUS.45</head>
<p>Who, then, is so senseless as to imagine that he reigns in heaven who ought not even
to have reigned on earth? It was not without humour that a certain poet wrote of the triumph
of Cupid: in which book he not only represented Cupid as the most powerful of the gods,
but also as their conqueror. For having enumerated the loves of each, by which they had
come into the power and dominion of Cupid, he sets in array a procession, in which Jupiter,
with the other gods, is led in chains before the chariot of him, celebrating a triumph. This
is elegantly pictured by the poet, but it is not far removed from the truth. For he who is
without virtue, who is overpowered by desire and wicked lusts, is not, as the poet feigned,
in subjection to Cupid, but to everlasting death. But let us cease to speak concerning morals;
let us examine the matter, in order that men may understand in what errors they are
miserably engaged. The common people imagine that Jupiter reigns in heaven; both learned
and unlearned are alike persuaded of this. For both religion itself, and prayers, and hymns,
and shrines, and images demonstrate this. And yet they admit that he was also descended
from Saturn and Rhea. How can he appear a god, or be believed, as the poet says, to be the
author of men and all things, when innumerable thousands of men existed before his
birth—those, for instance, who lived during the reign of Saturn, and enjoyed the light
sooner than Jupiter? I see that one god was king in the earliest times, and another in the
times that followed. It is therefore possible that there may be another hereafter. For if the
former kingdom was changed, why should we not expect that the latter may possibly be
changed, unless by chance it was possible for Saturn to produce one more powerful than
himself, but impossible for Jupiter so to do? And yet the divine government is always unchangeable;
or if it is changeable, which is an impossibility, it is undoubtedly changeable at
all times.</p>
<p>Is it possible, then, for Jupiter to lose his kingdom as his father lost it? It is so undoubtedly.
For when that deity had spared neither virgins nor married women, he abstained
from Thetis only in consequence of an oracle which foretold that whatever son should be
born from her would be greater than his father. And first of all there was in him a want of
foreknowledge not befitting a god; for had not Themis related to him future events, he would
not have known them of his own accord. But if he is not divine, he is not indeed a god; for
the name of divinity is derived from god, as humanity is from man. Then there was a consciousness
of weakness; but he who has feared, must plainly have feared one greater than
himself. But he who does this assuredly knows that he is not the greatest, since something
greater can exist. He also swears most solemnly by the Stygian marsh: “Which is set forth
the sole object of religious dread to the gods above.” What is this object of religious dread?
<note type="footnote">45 [COMPARE THE REMORSELESS SATIRE OF ARNOBIUS, VOL. VI. P. 498.]</note>

<pb n="40"/>
Or by whom is it set forth? Is there, then, some mighty power which may punish the gods
who commit perjury? What is this great dread of the infernal marsh, if they are immortal?
Why should they fear that which none are about to see, except those who are bound by the
necessity of death? Why, then, do men raise their eyes to the heaven? Why do they swear
by the gods above, when the gods above themselves have recourse to the infernal gods, and
find among them an object of veneration and worship? But what is the meaning of that
saying, that there are fates whom all the gods and Jupiter himself obey? If the power of the
Parcæ is so great, that they are of more avail than all the heavenly gods, and their ruler and
lord himself, why should not they be rather said to reign, since necessity compels all the
gods to obey their laws and ordinances? Now, who can entertain a doubt that he who is
subservient to anything cannot be greatest? For if he were so, he would not receive fates,
but would appoint them. Now I return to another subject which I had omitted. In the case
of one goddess only he exercised self-restraint, though he was deeply enamoured of her; but
this was not from any virtue, but through fear of a successor. But this fear plainly denotes
one who is both mortal and feeble, and of no weight: for at the very hour of his birth he
might have been put to death, as his elder brother had been put to death; and if it had been
possible for him to have lived, he would never have given up the supreme power to a
younger brother. But Jupiter himself having been preserved by stealth, and stealthily nourished,
was called Zeus, or Zen,46 not, as they imagine, from the fervor of heavenly fire, or
because he is the giver of life, or because he breathes life into living creatures, which power
belongs to God alone; for how can he impart the breath of life who has himself received it
from another source? But he was so called because he was the first who lived of the male
children of Saturn. Men, therefore, might have had another god as their ruler, if Saturn had
not been deceived by his wife. But it will be said the poets feigned these things. Whoever
entertains this opinion is in error. For they spoke respecting men; but in order that they
might embellish those whose memory they used to celebrate with praises, they said that
they were gods. Those things, therefore, which they spoke concerning them as gods were
feigned, and not those which they spoke concerning them as men; and this will be manifest
from an instance which we will bring forward. When about to offer violence to Danae, he
poured into her lap a great quantity of golden coins. This was the price which he paid for
her dishonour. But the poets who spoke about him as a god, that they might not weaken
the authority of his supposed majesty, feigned that he himself descended in a shower of
gold, making use of the same figure with which they speak of showers of iron when they
describe a multitude of darts and arrows. He is said to have carried away Ganymede by an
eagle; it is a picture of the poets. But he either carried him off by a legion, which has an eagle
for its standard; or the ship on board of which he was placed had its tutelary deity in the
<note type="footnote">46 Ζεὺς, or Ζη̑ν. [Quad sit auctor vitæ. Delphin note.]</note>

<pb n="41"/>
shape of an eagle, just as it had the effigy of a bull when he seized Europa and conveyed her
across the sea. In the same manner, it is related that he changed Io, the daughter of Inachus,
into a heifer. And in order that she might escape the anger of Juno, just as she was, now
covered with bristly hair, and in the shape of a heifer, she is said to have swam over the sea,
and to have come into Egypt; and there, having recovered her former appearance, she became
the goddess who is now called Isis. By what argument, then, can it be proved that Europa
did not sit on the bull, and that Io was not changed into a heifer? Because there is a fixed
day in the annals on which the voyage of Isis is celebrated; from which fact we learn that
she did not swim across the sea, but sailed over. Therefore they who appear to themselves
to be wise because they understand that there cannot be a living and earthly body in heaven,
reject the whole story of Ganymede as false, and perceive that the occurrence took place on
earth, inasmuch as the matter and the lust itself is earthly. The poets did not therefore invent
these transactions, for if they were to do so they would be most worthless; but they added
a certain colour to the transactions.47 For it was not for the purpose of detraction that they
said these things, but from a desire to embellish them. Hence men are deceived; especially
because, while they think that all these things are feigned by the poets, they worship that of
which they are ignorant. For they do not know what is the limit of poetic licence, how far
it is allowable to proceed in fiction, since it is the business of the poet with some gracefulness
to change and transfer actual occurrences into other representations by oblique transformations.
But to feign the whole of that which you relate, that is to be foolish and deceitful
rather than to be a poet.</p>
<p>But grant that they feigned those things which are believed to be fabulous, did they also
feign those things which are related about the female deities and the marriages of the gods?
Why, then, are they so represented, and so worshipped? unless by chance not the poets only,
but painters also, and statuaries, speak falsehoods. For if this is the Jupiter who is called by
you a god, if it is not he who was born from Saturn and Ops, no other image but his alone
ought to have been placed in all the temples. What meaning have the effigies of women?
What the doubtful sex? in which, if this Jupiter is represented, the very stones will confess
that he is a man. They say that the poets have spoken falsely, and yet they believe them: yes,
truly they prove by the fact itself that the poets did not speak falsely; for they so frame the
images of the gods, that, from the very diversity of sex, it appears that these things which
the poets say are true. For what other conclusion does the image of Ganymede and the effigy
of the eagle admit of, when they are placed before the feet of Jupiter in the temples, and are
worshipped equally with himself, except that the memory of impious guilt and debauchery
remains for ever? Nothing, therefore, is wholly invented by the poets: something perhaps
is transferred and obscured by oblique fashioning, under which the truth was enwrapped
<note type="footnote">47 [On the Poets, vol. i. cap. 2, p. 273.]</note>

<pb n="42"/>
and concealed; as that which was related about the dividing of the kingdoms by lot. For they
say that the heaven fell to the share of Jupiter, the sea to Neptune, and the infernal regions
to Pluto. Why was not the earth rather taken as the third portion, except that the transaction
took place on the earth? Therefore it is true that they so divided and portioned out the
government of the world, that the empire of the east fell to Jupiter, a part of the west was
allotted to Pluto, who had the surname of Agesilaus; because the region of the east, from
which light is given to mortals, seems to be higher, but the region of the west lower. Thus
they so veiled the truth under a fiction, that the truth itself detracted nothing from the
public persuasion. It is manifest concerning the share of Neptune; for we say that his kingdom
resembled that unlimited authority possessed by Mark Antony, to whom the senate had
decreed the power of the maritime coast, that he might punish the pirates, and tranquillize
the whole sea. Thus all the maritime coasts, together with the islands, fell to the lot of
Neptune. How can this be proved? Undoubtedly ancient stories attest it. Euhemerus, an
ancient author, who was of the city of Messene, collected the actions of Jupiter and of the
others, who are esteemed gods, and composed a history from the titles and sacred inscriptions
which were in the most ancient temples, and especially in the sanctuary of the Triphylian
Jupiter, where an inscription indicated that a golden column had been placed by Jupiter
himself, on which column he wrote an account of his exploits, that posterity might have a
memorial of his actions. This history was translated and followed by Ennius, whose words
are these: “Where Jupiter gives to Neptune the government of the sea, that he might reign
in all the islands and places bordering on the sea.”</p>
<p>The accounts of the poets, therefore, are true, but veiled with an outward covering and
show. It is possible that Mount Olympus may have supplied the poets with the hint for
saying that Jupiter obtained the kingdom of heaven, because Olympus is the common name
both of the mountain and of heaven. But the same history informs us that Jupiter dwelt on
Mount Olympus, when it says: “At that time Jupiter spent the greatest part of his life on
Mount Olympus; and they used to resort to him thither for the administration of justice, if
any matters were disputed. Moreover, if any one had found out any new invention which
might be useful for human life, he used to come thither and display it to Jupiter.” The poets
transfer many things after this manner, not for the sake of speaking falsely against the objects
of their worship, but that they may by variously coloured figures add beauty and grace to
their poems. But they who do not understand the manner, or the cause, or the nature of
that which is represented by figure, attack the poets as false and sacrilegious. Even the
philosophers were deceived by this error; for because these things which are related about
Jupiter appeared unsuited to the character of a god, they introduced two Jupiters, one natural,
the other fabulous. They saw, on the one hand, that which was true, that he, forsooth,
concerning whom the poets speak, was man; but in the case of that natural Jupiter, led by
the common practise of superstition, they committed an error, inasmuch as they transferred

<pb n="43"/>
the name of a man to God, who, as we have already said, because He is one only, has no
need of a name. But it is undeniable that he is Jupiter who was born from Ops and Saturn.
It is therefore an empty persuasion on the part of those who give the name of Jupiter to the
Supreme God. For some are in the habit of defending their errors by this excuse; for, when
convinced of the unity of God, since they cannot deny this, they affirm that they worship
Him, but that it is their pleasure that He should be called Jupiter. But what can be more
absurd than this? For Jupiter is not accustomed to be worshipped without the accompanying
worship of his wife and daughter. From which his real nature is evident; nor is it lawful for
that name to be transferred thither,48 where there is neither any Minerva nor Juno. Why
should I say that the peculiar meaning of this name does not express a divine, but human
power? For Cicero explains the names Jupiter and Juno as being derived from giving help;49
and Jupiter is so called as if he were a helping father,—a name which is ill adapted to God:
for to help is the part of a man conferring some aid upon one who is a stranger, and in a
case where the benefit is small. No one implores God to help him, but to preserve him, to
give him life and safety, which is a much greater and more important matter than to help.</p>
<p>And since we are speaking of a father, no father is said to help his sons when he begets
or brings them up. For that expression is too insignificant to denote the magnitude of the
benefit derived from a father. How much more unsuitable is it to God, who is our true
Father, by whom we exist, and whose we are altogether, by whom we are formed, endued
with life, and enlightened, who bestows upon us life, gives us safety, and supplies us with
various kinds of food! He has no apprehension of the divine benefits who thinks that he is
only aided by God. Therefore he is not only ignorant, but impious, who disparages the excellency
of the supreme power under the name of Jupiter. Wherefore, if both from his actions
and character we have proved that Jupiter was a man, and reigned on earth, it only remains
that we should also investigate his death. Ennius, in his sacred history, having described all
the actions which he performed in his life, at the close thus speaks: Then Jupiter, when he
had five times made a circuit of the earth, and bestowed governments upon all his friends
and relatives, and left laws to men, provided them with a settled mode of life and corn, and
given them many other benefits, and having been honoured with immortal glory and remembrance,
left lasting memorials to his friends, and when his age50 was almost spent, he
changed51 his life in Crete, and departed to the gods. And the Curetes, his sons, took charge
of him, and honoured him; and his tomb is in Crete, in the town of Cnossus, and Vesta is

said to have founded this city; and on his tomb is an inscription in ancient Greek characters,
“Zan Kronou,” which is in Latin, “Jupiter the son of Saturn.” This undoubtedly is not handed
down by poets, but by writers of ancient events; and these things are so true, that they are
confirmed by some verses of the Sibyls, to this effect:—
<lg>
<l>“Inanimate demons, images of the dead,</l>
<l>Whose tombs the ill-fated Crete possesses as a boast.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Cicero, in his treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods, having said that three Jupiters
were enumerated by theologians, adds that the third was of Crete, the son of Saturn, and
that his tomb is shown in that island. How, therefore, can a god be alive in one place, and
dead in another; in one place have a temple, and in another a tomb? Let the Romans then
know that their Capitol, that is the chief head of their objects of public veneration, is nothing
but an empty monument.</p>
<p>Let us now come to his father who reigned before him, and who perhaps had more
power in himself, because he is said to be born from the meeting of such great elements. Let
us see what there was in him worthy of a god, especially that he is related to have had the
golden age, because in his reign there was justice in the earth. I find something in him which
was not in his son. For what is so befitting the character of a god, as a just government and
an age of piety? But when, on the same principle, I reflect that he is a son, I cannot consider
him as the Supreme God; for I see that there is something more ancient than himself,—
namely, the heaven and the earth. But I am in search of a God beyond whom nothing
has any existence, who is the source and origin of all things. He must of necessity exist who
framed the heaven itself, and laid the foundations of the earth. But if Saturn was born from
these, as it is supposed, how can he be the chief God, since he owes his origin to another?
Or who presided over the universe before the birth of Saturn? But this, as I recently said, is
a fiction of the poets. For it was impossible that the senseless elements, which are separated
by so long an interval, should meet together and give birth to a son, or that he who was born
should not at all resemble his parents, but should have a form which his parents did not
possess.</p>
<p>Let us therefore inquire what degree of truth lies hid under this figure. Minucius Felix,
in his treatise which has the title of Octavius,52 alleged these proofs: “That Saturn, when he
had been banished by his son, and had come into Italy, was called the son of Coelus (heaven),
because we are accustomed to say that those whose virtue we admire, or those who have
unexpectedly arrived, have fallen from heaven; and that he was called the son of earth, because
we name those who are born from unknown parents sons of earth.” These things, indeed,
have some resemblance to the truth, but are not true, because it is evident that even during
<note type="footnote">52 [Condensed from cap. xxii. See vol. iv. p. 186, this series.]</note>

<pb n="45"/>
his reign he was so esteemed. He might have argued thus: That Saturn, being a very
powerful king, in order that the memory of his parents might be preserved, gave their names
to the heaven and earth, whereas these were before called by other names, for which reason
we know that names were applied both to mountains and rivers. For when the poets speak
of the offspring of Atlas, or of the river Inachus, they do not absolutely say that men could
possibly be born from inanimate objects; but they undoubtedly indicate those who were
born from those men, who either during their lives or after their death gave their names to
mountains or rivers. For that was a common practise among the ancients, and especially
among the Greeks. Thus we have heard that seas received the names of those who had fallen
into them, as the Ægean, the Icarian, and the Hellespont. In Latium, also, Aventinus gave
his name to the mountain on which he was buried; and Tiberinus, or Tiber, gave his name
to the river in which he was drowned. No wonder, then, if the names of those who had given
birth to most powerful kings were attributed to the heaven and earth. Therefore it appears
that Saturn was not born from heaven, which is impossible, but from that man who bore
the name of Uranus. And Trismegistus attests the truth of this; for when he said that very
few had existed in whom there was perfect learning, he mentioned by name among these
his relatives, Uranus, Saturn, and Mercury. And because he was ignorant of these things,
he gave another account of the matter; how he might have argued, I have shown. Now I will
say in what manner, at what time, and by whom this was done; for it was not Saturn who
did this, but Jupiter. Ennius thus relates in his sacred history: “Then Pan leads him to the
mountain, which is called the pillar of heaven. Having ascended thither, he surveyed the
lands far and wide, and there on that mountain he builds an altar to Coelus; and Jupiter was
the first who offered sacrifice on that altar. In that place he looked up to heaven, by which
name we now call it, and that which was above the world which was called the firmament,53
and he gave to the heaven its name from the name of his grandfather; and Jupiter in prayer
first gave the name of heaven to that which was called firmament,54 and he burnt entire the
victim which he there offered in sacrifice.” Nor is it here only that Jupiter is found to have
offered sacrifice. Cæsar also, in Aratus, relates that Aglaosthenes says that when he was
setting out from the island of Naxos against the Titans, and was offering sacrifice on the
shore, an eagle flew to Jupiter as an omen, and that the victor received it as a good token,
and placed it under his own protection. But the sacred history testifies that even beforehand
an eagle had sat upon his head, and portended to him the kingdom. To whom, then, could
Jupiter have offered sacrifice, except to his grandfather Coelus, who, according to the saying
of Euhemerus,55 died in Oceania, and was buried in the town of Aulatia?</p>

<head>CHAP. XII.—THAT THE STOICS TRANSFER THE FIGMENTS OF THE POETS TO
A PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.</head>
<p>Since we have brought to light the mysteries of the poets, and have found out the parents
of Saturn, let us return to his virtues and actions. He was, they say, just in his rule. First,
from this very circumstance he is not now a god, inasmuch as he has ceased to be. In the
next place, he was not even just, but impious not only towards his sons, whom he devoured,
but also towards his father, whom he is said to have mutilated. And this may perhaps have
happened in truth. But men, having regard to the element which is called the heaven, reject
the whole fable as most foolishly invented; though the Stoics, (according to their custom)
endeavour to transfer it to a physical system, whose opinion Cicero has laid down in his
treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods. They held, he says, that the highest and ethereal
nature of heaven, that is, of fire, which by itself produced all things, was without that part
of the body which contained the productive organs. Now this theory might have been suitable
to Vesta, if she were called a male. For it is on this account that they esteem Vesta to be a
virgin, inasmuch as fire is an incorruptible element; and nothing can be born from it, since
it consumes all things, whatever it has seized upon. Ovid in the Fasti says:56 “Nor do you
esteem Vesta to be anything else than a living flame; and you see no bodies produced from
flame. Therefore she is truly a virgin, for she sends forth no seed, nor receives it, and loves
the attendants of virginity.”</p>
<p>This also might have been ascribed to Vulcan, who indeed is supposed to be fire, and
yet the poets did not mutilate him. It might also have been ascribed to the sun, in whom is
the nature and cause of the productive powers. For without the fiery heat of the sun nothing
could be born, or have increase; so that no other element has greater need of productive
organs than heat, by the nourishment of which all things are conceived, produced, and
supported. Lastly, even if the case were as they would have it, why should we suppose that
Coelus was mutilated, rather than that he was born without productive organs? For if he
produces by himself, it is plain that he had no need of productive organs, since he gave birth
to Saturn himself; but if he had them, and suffered mutilation from his son, the origin of all
things and all nature would have perished. Why should I say that they deprive Saturn himself
not only of divine, but also of human intelligence, when they affirm that Saturn is he who
<note type="footnote">men who had distinguished themselves by their exploits, or benefits conferred upon men, and who were therefore,
after their death, worshipped as gods. The Christian writers frequently refer to Euhemerus as helping them to
prove that the pagan mythology consisted only of fables invented by men. See Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Biography.</note>
<note type="footnote">56 vi. 291. [Tayler Lewis (ut supra), note xii. p. 119.]</note>

<pb n="47"/>
comprises the course and change of the spaces and seasons, and that he has that very name
in Greek? For he is called Cronos, which is the same as Chronos, that is, a space of time.
But he is called Saturn, because he is satiated with years. These are the words of Cicero,
setting forth the opinion of the Stoics: “The worthlessness of these things any one may
readily understand. For if Saturn is the son of Coelus, how could Time have been born from
Coelus, or Coelus have been mutilated by Time, or afterwards could Time have been despoiled
of his sovereignty by his son Jupiter? Or how was Jupiter born from Time? Or with what
years could eternity be satiated, since it has no limit?”57</p>

<head>CHAP. XIII.—HOW VAIN AND TRIFLING ARE THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE
STOICS RESPECTING THE GODS, AND IN THEM CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF
JUPITER, CONCERNING SATURN AND OPS.</head>
<p>If therefore these speculations of the philosophers are trifling, what remains, except that
we believe it to be a matter of fact that, being a man, he suffered mutilation from a man?
Unless by chance any one esteems him as a god who feared a co-heir; whereas, if he had
possessed any divine knowledge, he ought not to have mutilated his father, but himself, to
prevent the birth of Jupiter, who deprived him of the possession of his kingdom. And he
also, when he had married his sister Rhea, whom in Latin we call Ops, is said to have been
warned by an oracle not to bring up his male children, because it would come to pass that
he should be driven into banishment by a son. And being in fear of this, it is plain that he
did not devour his sons, as the fables report, but put them to death; although it is written
in sacred history that Saturn and Ops, and other men, were at that time accustomed to eat
human flesh, but that Jupiter, who gave to men laws and civilization, was the first who by
an edict prohibited the use of that food. Now if this is true, what justice can there possibly
have been in him? But let us suppose it to be a fictitious story that Saturn devoured his sons,
only true after a certain fashion; must we then suppose, with the vulgar, that he has eaten
his sons, who has carried them out to burial? But when Ops had brought forth Jupiter, she
stole away the infant, and secretly sent him into Crete to be nourished. Again, I cannot but
blame his want of foresight. For why did he receive an oracle from another, and not from
himself? Being placed in heaven, why did he not see the things which were taking place on
earth? Why did the Corybantes with their cymbals escape his notice? Lastly, why did there
exist any greater force which might overcome his power? Doubtless, being aged, he was
easily overcome by one who was young, and despoiled of his sovereignty. He was therefore
banished and went into exile; and after long wanderings came into Italy in a ship, as Ovid
relates in his Fasti:—
<lg>
<l>“The cause of the ship remains to be explained. The scythe-bearing god came to</l>
<l>the Tuscan river in a ship, having first traversed the world.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Janus received him wandering and destitute; and the ancient coins are a proof of this,
on which there is a representation of Janus with a double face, and on the other side a ship;
as the same poet adds:—
<lg>
<l>“But pious posterity represented a ship on the coin, bearing testimony to the
arrival of the stranger god.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Not only therefore all the poets, but the writers also of ancient histories and events,
agree that he was a man, inasmuch as they handed down to memory his actions in Italy: of

<pb n="49"/>
Greek writers, Diodorus and Thallus; of Latin writers, Nepos, Cassius, and Varro. For since
men lived in Italy after a rustic fashion,58—
<lg>
<l>“He brought the race to union first,</l>
<l>Erewhile on mountain tops dispersed,</l>
<l>And gave them statutes to obey,</l>
<l>And willed the land wherein he lay</l>
<l>Should Latium’s title bear.”</l>
</lg>
Does any one imagine him to be a god, who was driven into banishment, who fled, who lay
hid? No one is so senseless. For he who flees, or lies hid, must fear both violence and death.
Orpheus, who lived in more recent times than his, openly relates that Saturn reigned on
earth and among men:—
<lg>
<l>“First Cronus ruled o’er men on earth,</l>
<l>And then from Cronus sprung the mighty king,</l>
<l>The widely sounding Zeus.”</l>
</lg>    
And also our own Maro says:59
<lg>
<l>“This life the golden Saturn led on earth;”</l>
</lg>
and in another place:60—
<lg>
<l>“That was the storied age of gold,</l>
<l>So peacefully, serenely rolled</l>
<l>The years beneath his reign.”</l>
</lg>
The poet did not say in the former passage that he led this life in heaven, nor in the latter
passage that he reigned over the gods above. From which it appears that he was a king on
earth; and this he declares more plainly in another place:61—
<lg>
<l>“Restorer of the age of gold,</l>
</lg>   
<note type="footnote">58 Virg., Æneid, viii. 321.</note>
<note type="footnote">59 Georg., ii. 538.</note>
<note type="footnote">60 Æneid, viii. 324.</note>
<note type="footnote">61 Ibid., vi. 793.</note>

<pb n="50"/>
<lg>
<l>In lands where Saturn ruled of old.”</l>
</lg>
Ennius, indeed, in his translation of Euhemerus says that Saturn was not the first who
reigned, but his father Uranus. In the beginning, he says, Coelus first had the supreme power
on the earth. He instituted and prepared that kingdom in conjunction with his brothers.
There is no great dispute, if there is doubt, on the part of the greatest authorities respecting
the son and the father. But it is possible that each may have happened: that Uranus first
began to be pre-eminent in power among the rest, and to have the chief place, but not the
kingdom; and that afterwards Saturn acquired greater resources, and took the title of king.</p>

<pb n="51"/>
<head>CHAP. XIV.—WHAT THE SACRED HISTORY OF EUHEMERUS AND ENNIUS
TEACHES CONCERNING THE GODS.</head>
<p>Now, since the sacred history differs in some degree from those things which we have
related, let us open those things which are contained in the true writings, that we may not,
in accusing superstitions, appear to follow and approve of the follies of the poets. These are
the words of Ennius: “Afterwards Saturn married Ops. Titan, who was older than Saturn,
demands the kingdom for himself. Upon this their mother Vesta, and their sisters Ceres
and Ops, advise Saturn not to give up the kingdom to his brother. Then Titan, who was inferior
in person to Saturn, on that account, and because he saw that his mother and sisters
were using their endeavours that Saturn might reign, yielded the kingdom to him. He
therefore made an agreement with Saturn, that if any male children should be born to him,
he would not bring them up. He did so for this purpose, that the kingdom might return to
his own sons. Then, when a son was first born to Saturn, they slew him. Afterwards twins
were born, Jupiter and Juno. Upon this they present Juno to the sight of Saturn, and secretly
hide Jupiter, and give him to Vesta to be brought up, concealing him from Saturn. Ops also
brings forth Neptune without the knowledge of Saturn, and secretly hides him. In the same
manner Ops brings forth twins by a third birth, Pluto and Glauca. Pluto in Latin is Dispater;
others call him Orcus. Upon this they show to Saturn the daughter Glauca, and conceal and
hide the son Pluto. Then Glauca dies while yet young.” This is the lineage of Jupiter and his
brothers, as these things are written, and the relationship is handed down to us after this
manner from the sacred narrative. Also shortly afterwards he introduces these things: “Then
Titan, when he learned that sons were born to Saturn, and secretly brought up, secretly takes
with him his sons, who are called Titans, and seizes his brother Saturn and Ops, and encloses
them within a wall, and places over them a guard.”</p>
<p>The truth of this history is taught by the Erythræan Sibyl, who speaks almost the same
things, with a few discrepancies, which do not affect the subject-matter itself. Therefore
Jupiter is freed from the charge of the greatest wickedness, according to which he is reported
to have bound his father with fetters; for this was the deed of his uncle Titan, because he,
contrary to his promise and oath, had brought up male children. The rest of the history is
thus put together. It is said that Jupiter, when grown up, having heard that his father and
mother had been surrounded with a guard and imprisoned, came with a great multitude of
Cretans, and conquered Titan and his sons in an engagement, and rescued his parents from
imprisonment, restored the kingdom to his father, and thus returned into Crete. Then, after
these things, they say that an oracle was given to Saturn, bidding him to take heed lest his
son should expel him from the kingdom; that he, for the sake of weakening the oracle and
avoiding the danger, laid an ambush for Jupiter to kill him; that Jupiter, having learned the
plot, claimed the kingdom for himself afresh, and banished Saturn; and that he, when he

<pb n="52"/>
had been tossed over all lands, followed by armed men whom Jupiter had sent to seize or
put him to death, scarcely found a place of concealment in Italy.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<pb n="53"/>
<head>CHAP. XV.—HOW THEY WHO WERE MEN OBTAINED THE NAME OF GODS.</head>
<p>Now, since it is evident from these things that they were men, it is not difficult to see
in what manner they began to be called gods.62 For if there were no kings before Saturn or
Uranus, on account of the small number of men who lived a rustic life without any ruler,
there is no doubt but in those times men began to exalt the king himself, and his whole
family, with the highest praises and with new honours, so that they even called them gods;
whether on account of their wonderful excellence, men as yet rude and simple really entertained
this opinion, or, as is commonly the case, in flattery of present power, or on account
of the benefits by which they were set in order and reduced to a civilized state. Afterwards
the kings themselves, since they were beloved by those whose life they had civilized, after
their death left regret of themselves. Therefore men formed images of them, that they might
derive some consolation from the contemplation of their likenesses; and proceeding further
through love of their worth,63 they began to reverence the memory of the deceased, that
they might appear to be grateful for their services, and might attract their successors to a
desire of ruling well. And this Cicero teaches in his treatise on the Nature of the Gods, saying
“But the life of men and common intercourse led to the exalting to heaven by fame and
goodwill men who were distinguished by their benefits. On this account Hercules, on this
Castor and Pollux, Æsculapius and Liber” were ranked with the gods. And in another passage:
“And in most states it may be understood, that for the sake of exciting valour, or that the
men most distinguished for bravery might more readily encounter danger on account of
the state, their memory was consecrated with the honour paid to the immortal gods.” It was
doubtless on this account that the Romans consecrated their Cæsars, and the Moors their
kings. Thus by degrees religious honours began to be paid to them; while those who had
known them, first instructed their own children and grandchildren, and afterwards all their
posterity, in the practice of this rite. And yet these great kings, on account of the celebrity
of their name, were honoured in all provinces.</p>
<p>But separate people privately honoured the founders of their nation or city with the
highest veneration, whether they were men distinguished for bravery, or women admirable
for chastity; as the Egyptians honoured Isis, the Moors Juba, the Macedonians Cabirus, the
Carthaginians Uranus, the Latins Faunus, the Sabines Sancus, the Romans Quirinus. In the
same manner truly Athens worshipped Minerva, Samos Juno, Paphos Venus, Lemnos
Vulcan, Naxos Liber, and Delos Apollo. And thus various sacred rites have been undertaken
among different peoples and countries, inasmuch as men desire to show gratitude to their
princes, and cannot find out other honours which they may confer upon the dead. Moreover,
the piety of their successors contributed in a great degree to the error; for, in order that they
<note type="footnote">62 [Vol. ii. cap. 28, p. 143, this series.]</note>
<note type="footnote">63 Per amorem meriti. Some editions omit “meriti.”</note>

<pb n="54"/>
might appear to be born from a divine origin, they paid divine honours to their parents,
and ordered that they should be paid by others. Can any one doubt in what way the honours
paid to the gods were instituted, when he reads in Virgil the words of Æneas giving commands
to his friends:64—
<lg>
<l>“Now with full cups libation pour</l>
<l>To mighty Jove, whom all adore,</l>
<l>Invoke Anchises’ blessed soul.”</l>
</lg>
And he attributes to him not only immortality, but also power over the winds:65—
<lg>
<l>“Invoke the winds to speed our flight,</l>
<l>And pray that he we hold so dear</l>
<l>May take our offerings year by year,</l>
<l>Soon as our promised town we raise,</l>
<l>In temples sacred to his praise.”</l>
</lg>
In truth, Liber and Pan, and Mercury and Apollo, acted in the same way respecting Jupiter,
and afterwards their successors did the same respecting them. The poets also added their
influence, and by means of poems composed to give pleasure, raised them to the heaven;
as is the case with those who flatter kings, even though wicked, with false panegyrics. And
this evil originated with the Greeks, whose levity being furnished66 with the ability and copiousness
of speech, excited in an incredible degree mists of falsehoods. And thus from admiration
of them they first undertook their sacred rites, and handed them down to all nations.
On account of this vanity the Sibyl thus rebukes them:—
<lg>
<l>“Why trustest thou, O Greece, to princely men?</l>
<l>Why to the dead dost offer empty gifts?</l>
<l>Thou offerest to idols; this error who suggested,</l>
<l>That thou shouldst leave the presence of the mighty God,</l>
<l>And make these offerings?”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Marcus Tullius, who was not only an accomplished orator, but also a philosopher, since
he alone was an imitator of Plato, in that treatise in which he consoled himself concerning
the death of his daughter, did not hesitate to say that those gods who were publicly worshipped
were men. And this testimony of his ought to be esteemed the more weighty, because
<note type="footnote">64 Æneid, vii. 133.</note>
<note type="footnote">65 Ibid., v. 59.</note>
<note type="footnote">66 Instructa. [Vol. ii. cap. 18, p. 137, this series.]</note>

<pb n="55"/>
he held the priesthood of the augurs, and testifies that he worships and venerates the same
gods. And thus within the compass of a few verses he has presented us with two facts. For
while he declared his intention of consecrating the image of his daughter in the same manner
in which they were consecrated by the ancients, he both taught that they were dead, and
showed the origin of a vain superstition. “Since, in truth,” he says, “we see many men and
women among the number of the gods, and venerate their shrines, held in the greatest
honour in cities and in the country, let us assent to the wisdom of those to whose talents
and inventions we owe it that life is altogether adorned with laws and institutions, and established
on a firm basis. And if any living being was worthy of being consecrated, assuredly
it was this. If the offspring of Cadmus, or Amphitryon, or Tyndarus, was worthy of being
extolled by fame to the heaven, the same honour ought undoubtedly to be appropriated to
her. And this indeed I will do; and with the approbation of the gods, I will place you the
best and most learned of all women in their assembly, and will consecrate you to the estimation
of all men.” Some one may perhaps say that Cicero raved through excessive grief. But,
in truth, the whole of that speech, which was perfect both in learning and in its examples,
and in the very style of expression, gave no indications of a distempered mind, but of constancy
and judgment; and this very sentence exhibits no sign of grief. For I do not think that
he could have written with such variety, and copiousness, and ornament, had not his grief
been mitigated by reason itself, and the consolation of his friends and length of time. Why
should I mention what he says in his books concerning the Republic, and also concerning
glory? For in his treatise on the Laws, in which work, following the example of Plato, he
wished to set forth those laws which he thought that a just and wise state would employ, he
thus decreed concerning religion:67 “Let them reverence the gods, both those who have always
been regarded as gods of heaven, and those whose services to men have placed them in
heaven: Hercules, Liber, Æsculapius, Castor, Pollux, and Quirinus.” Also in his Tusculan
Disputations,68 when he said that heaven was almost entirely filled with the human race,
he said: “If, indeed, I should attempt to investigate ancient accounts, and to extract from
them those things which the writers of Greece have handed down, even those who are held
in the highest rank as gods will be found to have gone from us into heaven. Inquire whose
sepulchres are pointed out in Greece: remember, since you are initiated, what things are
handed down in the mysteries; and then at length you will understand how widely this
persuasion is spread.” He appealed, as it is plain, to the conscience of Atticus, that it might
be understood from the very mysteries that all those who are worshipped were men; and
when he acknowledged this without hesitation in the case of Hercules, Liber, Æsculapius,

Jupiter their fathers, and likewise respecting Neptune, Vulcan, Mars, and Mercury, whom
he termed the greater gods; and therefore he says that this opinion is widely spread, that we
may understand the same concerning Jupiter and the other more ancient gods: for if the
ancients consecrated their memory in the same manner in which he says that he will consecrate
the image and the name of his daughter, those who mourn may be pardoned, but
those who believe it cannot be pardoned. For who is so infatuated as to believe that heaven
is opened to the dead at the consent and pleasure of a senseless multitude? Or that any one
is able to give to another that which he himself does not possess? Among the Romans, Julius
was made a god, because it pleased a guilty man, Antony; Quirinus was made a god, because
it seemed good to the shepherds, though one of them was the murderer of his twin brother,
the other the destroyer of his country. But if Antony had not been consul, in return for his
services towards the state Caius Cæsar would have been without the honour even of a dead
man, and that, too, by the advice of his father-in-law Piso, and of his relative Lucius Cæsar,
who opposed the celebration of the funeral, and by the advice of Dolabella the consul, who
overthrew the column in the forum, that is, his monuments, and purified the forum. For
Ennius declares that Romulus was regretted by his people, since he represents the people
as thus speaking, through grief for their lost king: “O Romulus, Romulus, say what a
guardian of your country the gods produced you? You brought us forth within the regions
of light. O father, O sire, O race, descended from the gods.” On account of this regret they
more readily believed Julius Proculus uttering falsehoods, who was suborned by the fathers
to announce to the populace that he had seen the king in a form more majestic than that of
a man; and that he had given command to the people that a temple should be built to his
honour, that he was a god, and was called by the name of Quirinus. By which deed he at
once persuaded the people that Romulus had gone to the gods, and freed the senate from
the suspicion of having slain the king.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.— BY WHAT ARGUMENT IT IS PROVED THAT THOSE WHO ARE
DISTINGUISHED BY A DIFFERENCE OF SEX CANNOT BE GODS.69</head>
<p>I might be content with those things which I have related, but there still remain many
things which are necessary for the work which I have undertaken. For although, by destroying
the principal part of superstitions, I have taken away the whole, yet it pleases me to follow
up the remaining parts, and more fully to refute so inveterate a persuasion, that men may
at length be ashamed and repent of their errors. This is a great undertaking, and worthy of
a man. “I proceed to release the minds of men from the ties of superstitions,” as Lucretius70
says; and he indeed was unable to effect this, because he brought forward nothing true. This
is our duty, who both assert the existence of the true God and refute false deities. They,
therefore, who entertain the opinion that the poets have invented fables about the gods, and
yet believe in the existence of female deities, and worship them, are unconsciously brought
back to that which they had denied—that they have sexual intercourse, and bring forth. For
it is impossible that the two sexes can have been instituted except for the sake of generation.
But a difference of sex being admitted, they do not perceive that conception follows as a
consequence. And this cannot be the case with a God. But let the matter be as they imagine;
for they say that there are sons of Jupiter and of the other gods. Therefore new gods are
born, and that indeed daily, for gods are not surpassed in fruitfulness by men. It follows
that all things are full of gods without number, since forsooth none of them dies. For since
the multitude of men is incredible, and their number not to be estimated—though, as they
are born, they must of necessity die—what must we suppose to be the case with the gods
who have been born through so many ages, and have remained immortal? How is it, then,
that so few are worshipped? Unless we think by any means that there are two sexes of the
gods, not for the sake of generation, but for mere gratification, and that the gods practise
those things which men are ashamed to do, and to submit to. But when any are said to be
born from any, it follows that they always continue to be born, if they are born at any time;
or if they ceased at any time to be born, it is befitting that we should know why or at what
time they so ceased. Seneca, in his books of moral philosophy, not without some pleasantry,
asks, “What is the reason why Jupiter, who is represented by the poets as most addicted to
lust, ceased to beget children? Was it that he was become a sexagenarian, and was restrained
by the Papian law?71 Or did he obtain the privileges conferred by having three children? Or
did the sentiment at length occur to him, ‘What you have done to another, you may expect
from another;’ and does he fear lest any one should act towards him as he himself did to

Saturn?” But let those who maintain that they are gods, see in what manner they can answer
this argument which I shall bring forward. If there are two sexes of the gods, conjugal intercourse
follows; and if this takes place, they must have houses, for they are not without virtue
and a sense of shame, so as to do this openly and promiscuously, as we see that the brute
animals do. If they have houses, it follows that they also have cities; and for this we have the
authority of Ovid, who says, “The multitude of gods occupy separate places; in this front
the powerful and illustrious inhabitants of heaven have placed their dwellings.” If they have
cities, they will also have fields. Now who cannot see the consequence,—namely, that they
plough and cultivate their lands? And this is done for the sake of food. Therefore they are
mortal. And this argument is of the same weight when reversed. For if they have no lands,
they have no cities; and if they have no cities, they are also without houses. And if they have
no houses, they have no conjugal intercourse; and if they are without this, they have no female
sex. But we see that there are females among the gods also. Therefore there are not gods. If
any one is able, let him do away with this argument. For one thing so follows the other, that
it is impossible not to admit these last things. But no one will refute even the former argument.
Of the two sexes the one is stronger, the other weaker. For the males are more robust,
the females more feeble. But a god is not liable to feebleness; therefore there is no female
sex. To this is added that last conclusion of the former argument, that there are no gods,
since there are females also among the gods.</p>

<pb n="59"/>
<head>CHAP. XVII.—CONCERNING THE SAME OPINION OF THE STOICS, AND
CONCERNING THE HARDSHIPS AND DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT OF THE GODS.</head>
<p>On these accounts the Stoics form a different conception of the gods; and because they
do not perceive what the truth is, they attempt to join them with the system of natural things.
And Cicero, following them, brought forward this opinion respecting the gods and their
religions. Do you see then, he says, how an argument has been drawn from physical subjects
which have been well and usefully found out, to the existence of false and fictitious gods?
And this circumstance gave rise to false opinions and turbulent errors, and almost old-womanly
superstitions. For both the forms of the gods, and their ages, and clothing and ornaments,
are known to us; and moreover their races, and marriages, and all their relationships,
and all things reduced to the similitude of human infirmity. What can be said more plain,
more true? The chief of the Roman philosophy, and invested with the most honourable
priesthood, refutes the false and fictitious gods, and testifies that their worship consists of
almost old-womanly superstitions: he complains that men are entangled in false opinions
and turbulent errors. For the whole of his third book respecting the Nature of the Gods altogether
overthrows and destroys all religion. What more, therefore, is expected from us?
Can we surpass Cicero in eloquence? By no means; but confidence was wanting to him,
being ignorant of the truth, as he himself simply acknowledges in the same work. For he
says that he can more easily say what is not, than what is; that is, that he is aware that the
received system is false, but is ignorant of the truth.72 It is plain, therefore, that those who
are supposed to be gods were but men, and that their memory was consecrated after their
death. And on this account also different ages and established representations of form are
assigned to each, because their images were fashioned in that dress and of that age at which
death arrested each.</p>
<p>Let us consider, if you please, the hardships of the unfortunate gods. Isis lost her son;
Ceres her daughter; Latona, expelled and driven about over the earth, with difficulty found
a small island73 where she might bring forth. The mother of the gods both loved a beautiful
youth, and also mutilated him when found in company with a harlot; and on this account
her sacred rites are now celebrated by the Galli74 as priests. Juno violently persecuted harlots,
because she was not able to conceive by her brother.75 Varro writes, that the island Samos
was before called Parthenia, because Juno there grew up, and there also was married to
Jupiter. Accordingly there is a most noble and ancient temple of hers at Samos, and an image
fashioned in the dress of a bride; and her annual sacred rites are celebrated after the manner

<pb n="60"/>
of a marriage. If, therefore, she grew up, if she was at first a virgin and afterwards a woman,
he who does not understand that she was a human being confesses himself a brute. Why
should I speak of the lewdness of Venus, who ministered to the lusts of all, not only gods,
but also men? For from her infamous debauchery with Mars she brought forth Harmonia;
from Mercury she brought forth Hermaphroditus, who was born of both sexes; from Jupiter
Cupid; from Anchises Æneas; from Butes Eryx; from Adonis she could bring forth no offspring,
because he was struck by a boar, and slain, while yet a boy. And she first instituted
the art of courtesanship, as is contained in the sacred history; and taught women in Cyprus
to seek gain by prostitution, which she commanded for this purpose, that she alone might
not appear unchaste and a courter of men beyond other females. Has she, too, any claim to
religious worship, on whose part more adulteries are recorded than births? But not even
were those virgins who are celebrated able to preserve their chastity inviolate. For from what
source can we suppose that Erichthonius was born? Was it from the earth, as the poets
would have it appear? But the circumstance itself cries out. For when Vulcan had made
arms for the gods, and Jupiter had given him the option of asking for whatever reward he
might wish, and had sworn, according to his custom, by the infernal lake, that he would
refuse him nothing which he might ask, then the lame artificer demanded Minerva in marriage.
Upon this the excellent and mighty Jupiter, being bound by so great an oath, was not
able to refuse; he, however, advised Minerva to oppose and defend her chastity. Then in
that struggle they say that Vulcan shed his seed upon the earth, from which source
Erichthonius was born: and that this name was given to him from ἔριδος and χθσνός, that
is, from the contest and the ground. Why, then, did she, a virgin, entrust that boy shut up
with a dragon and sealed to three virgins born from Cecrops? An evident case of incest, as
I think, which can by no means be glossed over. Another, when she had almost lost her
lover, who was torn to pieces by his madened horses, called in the most excellent physician
Æsculapius for the treatment of the youth; and when he was healed,
<lg>
<l>“Trivia kind her favourite hides,</l>
<l>And to Egeria’s care confides,</l>
<l>To live in woods obscure and lone,</l>
<l>And lose in Virbius’ name his own.”76</l>
</lg>
What is the meaning of this so diligent and anxious care? Why this secret abode? Why this
banishment, either to so great a distance, or to a woman, or into solitude? Why, in the next
place, the change of name? Lastly, why such a determined hatred of horses? What do all
these things imply, but the consciousness of dishonour, and a love by no means consistent

with a virgin? There was evidently a reason why she undertook so great a labour for a youth
so faithful, who had refused compliance with the love of his stepmother.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—ON THE CONSECRATION OF GODS, ON ACCOUNT OF THE
BENEFITS WHICH THEY CONFERRED UPON MEN.</head>
<p>In this place also they are to be refuted, who not only admit that gods have been made
from men, but even boast of it as a subject of praise, either on account of their valour, as
Hercules, or of their gifts, as Ceres and Liber, or of the arts which they discovered, as
Æsculapius or Minerva. But how foolish these things are, and how unworthy of being the
causes why men should contaminate themselves with inexpiable guilt, and become enemies
to God, in contempt of whom they undertake offerings to the dead, I will show from particular
instances. They say that it is virtue77 which exalts man to heaven,—not, however, that
concerning which philosophers discuss, which consists in goods of the soul, but this connected
with the body, which is called fortitude; and since this was pre-eminent in Hercules, it
is believed to have deserved immortality. Who is so foolishly senseless as to judge strength
of body to be a divine or even a human good, when it has been assigned in greater measure
to cattle, and it is often impaired by one disease, or is lessened by old age itself, and altogether
fails? And so Hercules, when he perceived that his muscles were disfigured by ulcers, neither
wished to be healed nor to grow old, that he might not at any time appear to have less
strength or comeliness than he once had.78 They supposed that he ascended into heaven
from the funeral pile on which he had burnt himself alive; and those very qualities which
they most foolishly admired, they expressed by statues and images, and consecrated, so that
they might for ever remain as memorials of the folly of those who had believed that gods
owed their origin to the slaughter of beasts. But this, perchance, may be the fault of the
Greeks, who always esteemed most trifling things as of the greatest consequence. What is
the case of our own countrymen? Are they more wise? For they despise valour in an athlete,
because it produces no injury; but in the case of a king, because it occasions widely-spread
disasters, they so admire it as to imagine that brave and warlike generals are admitted to
the assembly of the gods, and that there is no other way to immortality than to lead armies,
to lay waste the territory of others, to destroy cities, to overthrow towns, to put to death or
enslave free peoples. Truly the greater number of men they have cast down, plundered, and
slain, so much the more noble and distinguished do they think themselves; and ensnared
by the show of empty glory, they give to their crimes the name of virtue. I would rather that
they should make to themselves gods from the slaughter of wild beasts, than approve of an
immortality so stained with blood. If any one has slain a single man, he is regarded as contaminated
and wicked, nor do they think it lawful for him to be admitted to this earthly
abode of the gods. But he who has slaughtered countless thousands of men, has inundated
<note type="footnote">77 Virtus in its first meaning denotes valour, the property of a man (vir); then it is used to signify moral excellence.</note>
<note type="footnote">78 Lit., than himself.</note>

<pb n="63"/>
plains with blood, and infected rivers, is not only admitted into the temple, but even into
heaven. In Ennius Africanus thus speaks: “If it is permitted any one to ascend to the regions
of the gods above, the greatest gate of heaven is open to me alone.” Because, in truth, he
extinguished and destroyed a great part of the human race. Oh how great the darkness in
which you were involved, O Africanus, or rather O poet, in that you imagined the ascent to
heaven to be open to men through slaughters and bloodshed! And Cicero also assented to
this delusion. It is so in truth, he said, O Africanus, for the same gate was open to Hercules;
as though he himself had been doorkeeper in heaven at the time when this took place. I indeed
cannot determine whether I should think it a subject of grief or of ridicule, when I see grave
and learned, and, as they appear to themselves, wise men, involved in such miserable waves
of errors. If this is the virtue which renders us immortal, I for my part should prefer to die,
rather than to be the cause of destruction to as many as possible. If immortality can be obtained
in no other way than by bloodshed, what will be the result if all shall agree to live in
harmony? And this may undoubtedly be realized, if men would cast aside their pernicious
and impious madness, and live in innocence and justice. Shall no one, then, be worthy of
heaven? Shall virtue perish, because it will not be permitted men to rage against their fellowmen?
But they who reckon the overthrow of cities and people as the greatest glory will not
endure public tranquillity: they will plunder and rage; and by the infliction of outrageous
injuries will disturb the compact of human society, that they may have an enemy whom
they may destroy with greater wickedness than that with which they attacked.</p>
<p>Now let us proceed to the remaining subjects. The conferring of benefits gave the name
of gods to Ceres and Liber. I am able to prove from the sacred writings that wine and corn
were used by men before the offspring of Coelus and Saturnus. But let us suppose that they
were introduced by these. Can it appear to be a greater thing to have collected corn, and
having bruised it, to have taught men to make bread; or to have pressed grapes gathered
from the vine, and to have made wine, than to have produced and brought forth from the
earth corn itself, or the vine? God, indeed, may have left these things to be drawn out by the
ingenuity of man; yet all things must belong to Him, who gave to man both wisdom to discover,
and those very things which might be discovered. The arts also are said to have gained
immortality for their inventors, as medicine for Æsculapius, the craft of the smith for Vulcan.
Therefore let us worship those also who taught the art of the fuller and of the shoemaker.
But why is not honour paid to the discoverer of the potter’s art? Is it that those rich men
despise Samian vessels? There are also other arts, the inventors of which greatly profited
the life of man. Why have not temples been assigned to them also? But doubtless it is Minerva
who discovered all, and therefore workmen offer prayers to her. Such, then, was the low
condition79 from which Minerva ascended to heaven. Is there truly any reason why any one
<note type="footnote">79 Ab his sordibus.</note>

<pb n="64"/>
should leave the worship of Him who created80 the earth with its living creatures, and the
heaven with its stars, for the adoration of her who taught men to set up the woof? What
place does he hold who taught the healing of wounds in the body? Can he be more excellent
than Him who formed the body itself, and the power of sensibility and of life? Finally, did
he contrive and bring to light the herbs themselves, and the other things in which the healing
art consists?</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO WORSHIP THE TRUE
GOD TOGETHER WITH FALSE DEITIES.</head>
<p>But some one will say that this supreme Being, who made all things, and those also who
conferred on men particular benefits, are entitled to their respective worship. First of all, it
has never happened that the worshipper of these has also been a worshipper of God. Nor
can this possibly happen. For if the honour paid to Him is shared by others, He altogether
ceases to be worshipped, since His religion requires us to believe that He is the one and only
God. The excellent poet exclaims, that all those who refined life by the invention of arts are
in the lower regions, and that even the discoverer himself of such a medicine and art was
thrust down by lightning to the Stygian waves, that we may understand how great is the
power of the Almighty Father, who can extinguish even gods by His lightnings. But ingenious
men perchance thus reasoned with themselves: Because God cannot be struck with lightning,
it is manifest that the occurrence never took place; nay, rather, because it did take place, it
is manifest that the person in question was a man, and not a god. For the falsehood of the
poets does not consist in the deed, but in the name. For they feared evil, if, in opposition to
the general persuasion, they should acknowledge that which was true. But if this is agreed
upon among themselves, that gods were made from men, why then do they not believe the
poets, if at any time they describe their banishments and wounds, their deaths, and wars,
and adulteries? From which things it may be understood that they could not possibly become
gods, since they were not even good men, and during their life they performed those actions
which bring forth everlasting death.</p>

<pb n="66"/>
<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE GODS PECULIAR TO THE ROMANS, AND THEIR SACRED
RITES.</head>
<p>I now come to the superstitions peculiar to the Romans, since I have spoken of those
which are common. The wolf, the nurse of Romulus, was invested with divine honours.
And I could endure this, if it had been the animal itself whose figure she bears. Livy relates
that there was an image of Larentina, and indeed not of her body, but of her mind and
character. For she was the wife of Faustulus, and on account of her prostitution she was
called among the shepherds wolf,81 that is, harlot, from which also the brothel82 derives its
name. The Romans doubtless followed the example of the Athenians in representing her
figure. For when a harlot, by name Leæna, had put to death a tyrant among them, because
it was unlawful for the image of a harlot to be placed in the temple, they erected the effigy
of the animal whose name she bore. Therefore, as the Athenians erected a monument from
the name, so did the Romans from the profession of the person thus honoured. A festival
was also dedicated to her name, and the Larentinalia were instituted. Nor is she the only
harlot whom the Romans worship, but also Faula, who was, as Verrius writes, the paramour
of Hercules. Now how great must that immortality be thought which is attained even by
harlots! Flora, having obtained great wealth by this practice, made the people her heir, and
left a fixed sum of money, from the annual proceeds of which her birthday might be celebrated
by public games, which they called Floralia. And because this appeared disgraceful to
the senate, in order that a kind of dignity might be given to a shameful matter, they resolved
that an argument should be taken from the name itself. They pretended that she was the
goddess who presides over flowers, and that she must be appeased, that the crops, together
with the trees or vines, might produce a good and abundant blossom. The poet followed up
this idea in his Fasti, and related that there was a nymph, by no means obscure, who was
called Chloris, and that, on her marriage with Zephyrus, she received from her husband as
a wedding gift the control over all flowers. These things are spoken with propriety, but to
believe them is unbecoming and shameful. And when the truth is in question, ought disguises
of this kind to deceive us? Those games, therefore, are celebrated with all wantonness, as is
suitable to the memory of a harlot. For besides licentiousness of words, in which all lewdness
is poured forth, women are also stripped of their garments at the demand of the people, and
then perform the office of mimeplayers, and are detained in the sight of the people with
indecent gestures, even to the satiating of unchaste eyes.</p>
<p>Tatius consecrated an image of Cloacina, which had been found in the great sewer; and
because he did not know whose likeness it was, he gave it a name from the place. Tullus
Hostilius fashioned and worshipped Fear and Pallor. What shall I say respecting him, but
<note type="footnote">81 Lupa. [See vol. iii. cap. 10, p. 138, this series.]</note>
<note type="footnote">82 Lupanar.</note>

<pb n="67"/>
that he was worthy of having his gods always at hand, as men commonly wish? The conduct
of Marcus Marcellus concerning the consecration of Honour and Valour differs from this
in goodness of the names, but agrees with it in reality. The senate acted with the same vanity
in placing Mind83 among the gods; for if they had possessed any intelligence, they would
never have undertaken sacred rites of this kind. Cicero says that Greece undertook a great
and bold design in consecrating the images of Cupids and Loves in the gymnasia: it is plain
that he flattered Atticus, and jested with his friend. For that ought not to have been called
a great design, or a design at all, but the abandoned and deplorable wickedness of unchaste
men, who exposed their children, whom it was their duty to train to an honourable course,
to the lust of youth, and wished them to worship gods of profligacy, in those places especially
where their naked bodies were exposed to the gaze of their corruptors, and at that age which,
through its simplicity and incautiousness, can be enticed and ensnared before it can be on
its guard. What wonder, if all kinds of profligacy flowed from this nation, among whom
vices themselves have the sanction of religion, and are so far from being avoided, that they
are even worshipped? And therefore, as though he surpassed the Greeks in prudence, he
subjoined to this sentence as follows: “Vices ought not to be consecrated, but virtues.” But
if you admit this, O Marcus Tullius, you do not see that it will come to pass that vices will
break in together with virtues, because evil things adhere to those which are good, and have
greater influence on the minds of men; and if you forbid these to be consecrated, the same
Greece will answer you that it worships some gods that it may receive benefits, and others
that it may escape injuries.</p>
<p>For this is always the excuse of those who regard their evils as gods, as the Romans esteem
Blight and Fever. If, therefore, vices are not to be consecrated, in which I agree with you,
neither indeed are virtues. For they have no intelligence or perception of themselves; nor
are they to be placed within walls or shrines made of clay, but within the breast; and they
are to be enclosed within, lest they should be false if placed without man. Therefore I laugh
at that illustrious law of yours which you set forth in these words: “But those things on account
of which it is given to man to ascend into heaven—I speak of mind, virtue, piety,
faith—let there be temples for their praises.” But these things cannot be separated from
man. For if they are to be honoured, they must necessarily be in man himself. But if they
are without man, what need is there to honour those things which you do not possess? For
it is virtue, which is to be honoured, and not the image of virtue; and it is to be honoured
not by any sacrifice, or incense, or solemn prayer, but only by the will and purpose. For
what else is it to honour virtue, but to comprehend it with the mind, and to hold it fast?
And as soon as any one begins to wish for this, he attains it. This is the only honour of virtue;
for no other religion and worship is to be held but that of the one God. To what purport is
<note type="footnote">83 Mens. [Tayler Lewis, Plato, etc., p. 219.]</note>

<pb n="68"/>
it, then, O wisest man, to occupy with superfluous buildings places which may turn out to
the service of men? To what purport is it to establish priests for the worship of vain and
senseless objects? To what purport to immolate victims? To what purport to bestow such
great expenditure on the forming or worshipping of images? The human breast is a stronger
and more uncorrupted temple: let this rather be adorned, let this be filled with the true
deities. For they who thus worship the virtues—that is, who pursue the shadows and images
of virtues—cannot hold the very things which are true. Therefore there is no virtue in any
one when vices bear rule; there is no faith when each individual carries off all things for
himself; there is no piety when avarice spares neither relatives nor parents, and passion
rushes to poison and the sword: no peace, no concord, when wars rage in public, and in
private enmities prevail even to bloodshed; no chastity when unbridled lusts contaminate
each sex, and the whole body in every part. Nor, however, do they cease to worship those
things which they flee from and hate. For they worship with incense and the tips of their
fingers those things which they ought to have shrunk from with their inmost feelings; and
this error is altogether derived from their ignorance of the principal and chief good.</p>
<p>When their city was occupied by the Gauls, and the Romans, who were besieged in the
Capitol, had made military engines from the hair of the women, they dedicated a temple to
the Bald Venus. They do not therefore understand how vain are their religions, even from
this very fact, that they jeer at them by these follies. They had perhaps learned from the
Lacedæmonians to invent for themselves gods from events. For when they were besieging
the Messenians, and they (the Messenians) had gone out secretly, escaping the notice of the
besiegers, and had hastened to plunder Lacedæmon, they were routed and put to flight by
the Spartan women. But the Lacedæmonians, having learned the stratagem of the enemy,
followed. The women in arms went out to a distance to meet them; and when they saw that
their husbands were preparing themselves for battle, supposing them to be Messenians, they
laid bare their persons. But the men, recognising their wives, and excited to passion by the
sight, rushed to promiscuous intercourse, for there was not time for discrimination. In like
manner, the youths who had on a former occasion been sent by the same people, having
intercourse with the virgins, from whom the Partheniæ were born, in memory of this deed
erected a temple and statue to armed Venus. And although this originated in a shameful
cause, yet it seems better to have consecrated Venus as armed than bald. At the same time
an altar was erected also to Jupiter Pistor (the baker), because he had admonished them in
a dream to make all the corn which they had into bread, and throw it into the camp of the
enemy; and when this was done, the siege was ended, since the Gauls despaired of being
able to reduce the Romans by want.</p>
<p>What a derision of religious rites is this! I were a defender of these, what could I complain
of so greatly as that the name of gods had come into such contempt as to be mocked by the
most disgraceful names? Who would not laugh at the goddess Fornax, or rather that learned

<pb n="69"/>
men should be occupied with celebrating the Fornacalia? Who can refrain from laughter
on hearing of the goddess Muta? They say that she is the goddess from whom the Lares were
born, and they call her Lara, or Larunda. What advantage can she, who is unable to speak,
afford to a worshipper? Caca also is worshipped, who informed Hercules of the theft of his
oxen, having obtained immortality through the betrayal of her brother; and Cunina, who
protects infants in the cradle, and keeps off witchcraft; and Stercutus, who first introduced
the method of manuring the land; and Tutinus, before whom brides sit, as an introduction
to the marriage rites; and a thousand other fictions, so that they who regarded these as objects
of worship may be said to be more foolish than the Egyptians, who worship certain monstrous
and ridiculous images. These however, have some delineation of form. What shall I say of
those who worship a rude and shapeless stone under the name of Terminus? This is he
whom Saturnus is said to have swallowed in the place of Jupiter; nor is the honour paid to
him undeservedly. For when Tarquinius wished to build the Capitol, and there were the
chapels of many gods on that spot, he consulted them by augury whether they would give
way to Jupiter; and when the rest gave way, Terminus alone remained. From which circumstance
the poet speaks of the immoveable stone of the Capitol. Now from this very fact how
great is Jupiter found to be, to whom a stone did not give way, with this confidence, perhaps,
because it had rescued him from the jaws of his father! Therefore, when the Capitol was
built, an aperture was left in the roof above Terminus himself, that, since he had not given
way, he might enjoy the free heaven; but they did not themselves enjoy this, who imagined
that a stone enjoyed it. And therefore they make public supplications to him, as to the god
who is the guardian of boundaries; and he is not only a stone, but sometimes also a stock.
What shall I say of those who worship such objects, unless—that they above all others are
stones and stocks?</p>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF CERTAIN DEITIES PECULIAR TO BARBARIANS, AND THEIR
SACRED RITES; AND IN LIKE MANNER CONCERNING THE ROMANS.</head>
<p>We have spoken of the gods themselves who are worshipped; we must now speak a few
words respecting their sacrifices and mysteries. Among the people of Cyprus, Teucer sacrificed
a human victim to Jupiter, and handed down to posterity that sacrifice which was lately
abolished by Hadrian when he was emperor. There was a law among the people of Tauris,
a fierce and inhuman nation, by which it was ordered that strangers should be sacrificed to
Diana; and this sacrifice was practised through many ages. The Gauls used to appease Hesus
and Teutas with human blood. Nor, indeed, were the Latins free from this cruelty, since
Jupiter Latialis is even now worshipped with the offering of human blood. What benefit do
they who offer such sacrifices implore from the gods? Or what are such deities able to bestow
on the men by whose punishments they are propitiated? But this is not so much a matter
of surprise with respect to barbarians, whose religion agrees with their character. But are
not our countrymen, who have always claimed for themselves the glory of gentleness and
civilization, found to be more inhuman by these sacrilegious rites? For these ought rather
to be esteemed impious, who, though they are embellished with the pursuits of liberal
training, turn aside from such refinement, than those who, being ignorant and inexperienced,
glide into evil practices from their ignorance of those which are good. And yet it is plain
that this rite of immolating human victims is ancient, since Saturn was honoured in Latium
with the same kind of sacrifice; not indeed that a man was slain at the altar, but that he was
thrown from the Milvian bridge into the Tiber. And Varro relates that this was done in accordance
with an oracle; of which oracle the last verse is to this effect: “And offer heads to
Ades, and to the father a man.”84 And because this appears ambiguous, both a torch and a
man are accustomed to be thrown to him. But it is said that sacrifices of this kind were put
an end to by Hercules when he returned from Spain; the custom still continuing, that instead
of real men, images made from rushes were cast forth, as Ovid informs us in his Fasti:85
“Until the Tirynthian came into these lands, gloomy sacrifices were annually offered in the
Leucadian manner: he threw into the water Romans made of straw; do you, after the example
of Hercules, cast86 in the images of human bodies.”</p>
<p>The Vestal virgins make these sacred offerings, as the same poet says:87 “Then also a
virgin is accustomed to cast from the wooden bridge the images of ancient men made from
rushes.”</p>
<note type="footnote">84 Or, lights. The oracle is ambiguous, since the word φωσ signifies a man, and also light. [i.e., φὼς = man,
and φω̑ς = light.]</note>

<pb n="71"/>
<p>For I cannot find language to speak of the infants who were immolated to the same
Saturn, on account of his hatred of Jupiter. To think that men were so barbarous, so savage,
that they gave the name of sacrifice to the slaughter of their own children, that is, to a deed
foul, and to be held in detestation by the human race; since, without any regard to parental
affection, they destroyed tender and innocent lives, at an age which is especially pleasing to
parents, and surpassed in brutality the savageness of all beasts, which—savage as they
are—still love their offspring! O incurable madness! What more could those gods do to
them, if they were most angry, than they now do when propitious, when they defile their
worshippers with parricide, visit them with bereavements, and deprive them of the sensibilities
of men? What can be sacred to these men? Or what will they do in profane places,
who commit the greatest crimes amidst the altars of the gods? Pescennius Festus relates in
the books of his History by a Satire, that the Carthaginians were accustomed to immolate
human victims to Saturn; and when they were conquered by Agathocles, the king of the Sicilians,
they imagined that the god was angry with them; and therefore, that they might
more diligently offer an expiation, they immolated two hundred sons of their nobles: “So
great the ills to which religion could prompt, which has ofttimes produced wicked and impious
deeds.” What advantage, then, did the men propose by that sacrifice, when they put
to death so large a part of the state, as not even Agathocles had slain when victorious?</p>
<p>From this kind of sacrifices those public rites are to be judged signs of no less madness;
some of which are in honour of the mother of the gods, in which men mutilate themselves;
others are in honour of Virtus, whom they also call Bellona, in which the priests make offsprings
not with the blood of another victim, but with their own.88 For, cutting their
shoulders, and thrusting forth drawn swords in each hand, they run, they are beside themselves,
they are frantic. Quintilian therefore says excellently in his Fanatic: “If a god compels
this, he does it in anger.” Are even these things sacred? Is it not better to live like cattle, than
to worship deities so impious, profane, and sanguinary? But we will discuss at the proper
time the source from which these errors and deeds of such great disgrace originated. In the
meantime, let us look also to other matters which are without guilt, that we may not seem
to select the worse parts through the desire of finding fault. In Egypt there are sacred rites
in honour of Isis, since she either lost or found her little son. For at first her priests, having
made their bodies smooth, beat their breasts, and lament, as the goddess herself had done
when her child was lost. Afterwards the boy is brought forward, as if found, and that
mourning is changed into joy. Therefore Lucan says, “And Osiris never sufficiently sought
for.” For they always lose, and they always find him. Therefore in the sacred rites there is a
representation of a circumstance which really occurred; and which assuredly declares, if we
have any intelligence, that she was a mortal woman, and almost desolate, had she not found
<note type="footnote">88 So the priests of Baal cut themselves, 1 Kings xviii. 28.</note>

<pb n="72"/>
one person. And this did not escape the notice of the poet himself; for he represents Pompey
when a youth as thus speaking, on hearing the death of his father: “I will now draw forth
the deity Isis from the tomb, and send her through the nations; and I will scatter through
the people Osiris covered with wood.” This Osiris is the same whom the people call Serapis.
For it is customary for the names of the dead who are deified to be changed, that no one, as
I believe, may imagine them to be men. For Romulus after his death became Quirinus, and
Leda became Nemesis, and Circe Marica; and Ino, when she had leapt into the sea, was
called Leucothea; and the mother Matuta; and her son Melicerta was called Palæmon and
Portumnus. And the sacred rites of the Eleusinian Ceres are not unlike these. For as in those
which have been mentioned the boy Osiris is sought with the wailing of his mother, so in
these Proserpine is carried away to contract an incestuous marriage with her uncle; and
because Ceres is said to have sought for her in Sicily with torches lighted from the top of
Etna, on this account her sacred rites are celebrated with the throwing of torches.</p>
<p>At Lampsacus the victim to he offered to Priapus is an ass, and the cause of the sacrifice
of this animal is thus set forth in the Fasti:—When all the deities had assembled at the festival
of the Great Mother, and when, satiated with feasting, they were spending the night in
sport, they say that Vesta had laid herself on the ground for rest, and had fallen asleep, and
that Priapus upon this formed a design against her honour as she slept; but that she was
aroused by the unseasonable braying of the ass on which Silenus used to ride, and that the
design of the insidious plotter was frustrated. On this account they say that the people of
Lampsacus were accustomed to sacrifice an ass to Priapus, as though it were in revenge; but
among the Romans the same animal was crowned at the Vestalia (festival of Vesta) with
loaves,89 in honour of the preservation of her chastity. What is baser, what more disgraceful,
than if Vesta is indebted to an ass for the preservation of her purity? But the poet invented
a fable. But was that more true which is related by those90 who wrote “Phenomena,” when
they speak concerning the two stars of Cancer, which the Greeks call asses? That they were
asses which carried across father Liber when he was unable to cross a river, and that he rewarded
one of them with the power of speaking with human voice; and that a contest arose
between him and Priapus; and Priapus, being worsted in the contest, was enraged, and slew
the victor. This truly is much more absurd. But poets have the licence of saying what they
will. I do not meddle with a mystery so odious; nor do I strip Priapus of his disguise, lest
something deserving of ridicule should be brought to light. It is true the poets invented these
fictions, but they must have been invented for the purpose of concealing some greater depravity.
Let us inquire what this is. But in fact it is evident. For as the bull is sacrificed to
Luna,91 because he also has horns as she has; and as “Persia propitiates with a horse Hyperion
<note type="footnote">89 Panibus, loaves made in the shape of crowns.</note>

<pb n="73"/>
surrounded with rays, that a slow victim may not be offered to the swift god;” so in this case
no more suitable victim could be found than that which resembled him to whom it is offered.</p>
<p>At Lindus, which is a town of Rhodes, there are sacred rites in honour of Hercules, the
observance of which differs widely from all other rites; for they are not celebrated with words
of good omen92 (as the Greeks term it), but with revilings and cursing. And they consider
it a violation of the sacred rites, if at any time during the celebration of the solemnities a
good word shall have escaped from any one even inadvertently. And this is the reason assigned
for this practice, if indeed there can be any reason in things utterly senseless. When
Hercules had arrived at the place, and was suffering hunger, he saw a ploughman at work,
and began to ask him to sell one of his oxen. But the ploughman replied that this was impossible,
because his hope of cultivating the land depended altogether upon those two bullocks.
Hercules, with his usual violence, because he was not able to receive one of them,
killed both. But the unhappy man, when he saw that his oxen were slain, avenged the injury
with revilings,—a circumstance which afforded gratification to the man of elegance and
refinement. For while he prepares a feast for his companions, and while he devours the oxen
of another man, he receives with ridicule and loud laughter the bitter reproaches with which
the other assails him. But when it had been determined that divine honours should be paid
to Hercules in admiration of his excellence, an altar was erected in his honour by the citizens,
which he named, from the circumstance, the yoke of oxen;93 and at this altar two yoked
oxen were sacrificed, like those which he had taken from the ploughman. And he appointed
the same man to be his priest, and directed him always to use the same revilings in offering
sacrifice, because he said that he had never feasted more pleasantly. Now these things are
not sacred, but sacrilegious, in which that is said to be enjoined, which, if it is done in other
things, is punished with the greatest severity. What, moreover, do the rites of the Cretan
Jupiter himself show, except the manner in which he was withdrawn from his father, or
brought up? There is a goat belonging to the nymph Amalthea, which gave suck to the infant;
and of this goat Germanicus Cæsar thus speaks, in his poem translated from Aratus:94—
<note type="footnote">92 εὐφημια. It was supposed that words of ill omen, if uttered during the offering of a sacrifice, would render
the gods unpropitious: the priest therefore, at the commencement of a sacrifice, called upon the people to abstain
from ill-omened words: εὐφημει̑τε, “favete linguis.”</note>
<note type="footnote">93 Βούζυγον.</note>
<note type="footnote">94 Aratus was the author of two Greek astronomical poems, the Φαινόμενα and the Διοσημε̑ια Virgil, in his
Georgics, has borrowed largely from the latter. Germanicus Cæsar, the grandson of Augustus, as stated in the
text, translated the Φαινόμενα.</note>

<lg>
<l>“She is supposed to be the nurse of Jupiter; if in truth the infant Jupiter pressed</l>
     <l rend=" indent">the faithful teats of the Cretan goat, which attests the gratitude of her</l>
     <l rend=" indent">lord by a bright constellation.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Musæus relates that Jupiter, when fighting against the Titans, used the hide of this goat
as a shield, from which circumstance he is called by the poets shield-bearer.95 Thus, whatever
was done in concealing the boy, that also is done by way of representation in the sacred
rites. Moreover, the mystery of his mother also contains the same story which Ovid sets
forth in the Fasti:—
<lg>
<l>“Now the lofty Ida resounds with tinklings, that the boy may cry in safety with</l>
    <l rend=" indent">infant mouth. Some strike their shields with stakes, some beat their</l>
    <l rend=" indent">empty helmets. This is the employment of the Curetes, this of the</l>
    <l rend=" indent">Corybantes. The matter was concealed, and imitations of the ancient</l>
    <l rend=" indent">deed remain; the attendant goddesses shake instruments of brass, and</l>
    <l rend=" indent">hoarse hides. Instead of helmets they strike cymbals, and drums instead</l>
    <l rend=" indent">of shields; the flute gives Phrygian strains, as it gave before.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Sallust rejected this opinion altogether, as though invented by the poets, and wished to
give an ingenious explanation of the reasons for which the Curetes are said to have nourished
Jupiter; and he speaks to this purport: Because they were the first to understand the worship
of the deity, that therefore antiquity, which exaggerates all things, made them known as the
nourishers of Jupiter. How much this learned man was mistaken, the matter itself at once
declares. For if Jupiter holds the first place, both among the gods and in religious rites, if
no gods were worshipped by the people before him, because they who are worshipped were
not yet born; it appears that the Curetes, on the contrary, were the first who did not understand
the worship of the deity, since all error was introduced by them, and the memory of
the true God was taken away. They ought therefore to have understood from the mysteries
and ceremonies themselves, that they were offering prayers to dead men. I do not then require
that any one should believe the fictions of the poets. If any one imagines that these speak
falsely, let him consider the writings of the pontiffs themselves, and weigh whatever there
is of literature pertaining to sacred rites: he will perhaps find more things than we bring
forward, from which he may understand that all things which are esteemed sacred are empty,
vain, and fictitious. But if any one, having discovered wisdom, shall lay aside his error, he
will assuredly laugh at the follies of men who are almost without understanding: I mean
those who either dance with unbecoming gestures, or run naked, anointed, and crowned
with chaplets, either wearing a mask or besmeared with mud. What shall I say about shields
<note type="footnote">95 αιγιοχος; “scutum habens.”</note>

<pb n="75"/>
now putrid with age? When they carry these, they think that they are carrying gods themselves
on their shoulders. For Furius Bibaculus is regarded among the chief examples of piety,
who, though he was prætor, nevertheless carried the sacred shield,96 preceded by the lictors,
though his office as proetor gave him an exemption from this duty. He was therefore not
Furius, but altogether mad,97 who thought that he graced his prætorship by this service.
Deservedly then, since these things are done by men not unskilful and ignorant, does
Lucretius exclaim:—
<lg>
<l>“O foolish minds of men! O blinded breasts! In what darkness of life and in how</l>
<l>great dangers is passed this term of life, whatever be its duration!”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Who that is possessed of any sense would not laugh at these mockeries, when he sees
that men, as though bereft of intelligence, do those things seriously, which if any one should
do in sport, he would appear too full of sport and folly?</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE VANITIES BEFORE DESCRIBED
IN ITALY AMONG THE ROMANS, AND WHO AMONG OTHER NATIONS.</head>
<p>The author and establisher of these vanities among the Romans was that Sabine king
who especially engaged98 the rude and ignorant minds of men with new superstitions: and
that he might do this with some authority, he pretended that he had meetings by night with
the goddess Egeria. There was a very dark cavern in the grove of Aricia, from which flowed
a stream with a never failing spring. Hither he was accustomed to withdraw himself without
any witnesses, that he might be able to pretend that, by the admonition of the goddess his
wife, he delivered to the people those sacred rites which were most acceptable to the gods.
It is evident that he wished to imitate the craftiness of Minos, who concealed himself in the
cave of Jupiter, and, after a long delay there, brought forward laws, as though delivered to
him by Jupiter, that he might bind men to obedience not only by the authority of his government,
but also by the sanction of religion. Nor was it difficult to persuade shepherds.
Therefore he instituted pontiffs, priests, Salii, and augurs; he arranged the gods in families;
and by these means he softened the fierce spirits of the new people and called them away
from warlike affairs to the pursuit of peace. But though he deceived others, he did not deceive
himself. For after many years, in the consulship of Cornelius and Bebius, in a field belonging
to the scribe Petilius, under the Janiculum, two stone chests were found by men who were
digging, in one of which was the body of Numa, in the other seven books in Latin respecting
the law of the pontiffs, and the same number written in Greek respecting systems of philosophy,
in which he not only annulled the religious rites which he himself had instituted, but
all others also. When this was referred to the senate, it was decreed that these books should
be destroyed. Therefore Quintus Petilius, the prætor who had jurisdiction in the city, burnt
them in an assembly of the people. This was a senseless proceeding; for of what advantage
was it that the books were burnt, when the cause on account of which they were burnt—that
they took away the authority due to religion—was itself handed down to memory? Every
one then in the senate was most foolish; for the books might have been burnt, and yet the
matter itself have been unknown. Thus, while they wish to prove even to posterity with what
piety they defended religious institutions, they lessened the authority of the institutions
themselves by their testimony.</p>
<p>But as Pompilius was the institutor of foolish superstitions among the Romans, so also,
before Pompilius, Faunus was in Latium, who both established impious rites to his grandfather
Saturnus, and honoured his father Picus with a place among the gods, and consecrated
his sister Fatua Fauna, who was also his wife; who, as Gabius Bassus relates, was called Fatua
because she had been in the habit of foretelling their fates to women, as Faunus did to men.
And Varro writes that she was a woman of such great modesty, that, as long as she lived,
<note type="footnote">98 Implicavit.</note>

<pb n="77"/>
no male except her husband saw her or heard her name. On this account women sacrifice
to her in secret, and call her the Good Goddess. And Sextus Claudius, in that book which
he wrote in Greek, relates that it was the wife of Faunus who, because, contrary to the
practice and honour of kings, she had drunk a jar of wine, and had become intoxicated, was
beaten to death by her husband with myrtle rods. But afterwards, when he was sorry for
what he had done, and was unable to endure his regret for her, he paid her divine honours.
For this reason they say that a covered jar of wine is placed at her sacred rites. Therefore
Faunus also left to posterity no slight error, which all that are intelligent see through. For
Lucilius in these verses derides the folly of those who imagine that images are gods: “The
terrestrial99 Lamiæ, which Faunus and Numa Pompilius and others instituted; at and these
he trembles, he places everything in this. As infant boys believe that every statue of bronze
is a living man, so these imagine that all things feigned are true: they believe that statues of
bronze contain a heart. It is a painter’s gallery;100 there is nothing true; all things are fictitious.”
The poet, indeed, compares foolish men to infants. But I say that they are much more
senseless than infants. For they (infants) suppose that images are men, whereas these take
them for gods: the one through their age, the others through folly, imagine that which is
not true: at any rate, the one soon ceased to be deceived; the foolishness of the others is
permanent, and always increases. Orpheus was the first who introduced the rites of father
Liber into Greece; and he first celebrated them on a mountain of Boeotia, very near to Thebes,
where Liber was born; and because this mountain continually resounded with the strains
of the lyre, it was called Cithæron.101 Those sacred rites are even now called Orphic, in
which he himself was lacerated and torn in pieces; and he lived about the same time with
Faunus. But which of them was prior in age admits of doubt, since Latinus and Priam reigned
during the same years, as did also their fathers Faunus and Laomedon, in whose reign
Orpheus came with the Argonauts to the coast of the Trojans.</p>
<p>Let us therefore advance further, and inquire who was really the first author of the
worship of the gods. Didymus,102 in the books of his commentary on Pindar, says that
<note type="footnote">99 Terricolas. Another reading is terriculas, bugbears.</note>
<note type="footnote">100 Pergula. The word properly means a projection attached to a house. Apelles is said to have placed his
pictures in such an adjunct, and to have concealed himself behind them, that he might hear the comments of
persons passing by.</note>
<note type="footnote">101 Cithæron, from “cithara,” a lyre.</note>
<note type="footnote">102 Didymus. A celebrated Alexandrian grammarian, a follower of the school of Aristarchus. He is distinguished
from other grammarians who bore the name of Didymus, by the surname Chalcenteros, which he is
said to have received from his unwearied diligence in study. Among his productions, which are all lost, was one
on the Homeric poems. He also wrote a commentary on Pindar, to which allusion is made in the text. See Smith’s
Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography.</note>

<pb n="78"/>
Melisseus, king of the Cretans, was the first who sacrificed to the gods, and introduced new
rites and parades of sacrifices. He had two daughters, Amalthæa and Melissa, who nourished
the youthful Jupiter with goats’ milk and honey. Hence that poetic fable derived its origin,
that bees flew to the child, and filled his mouth with honey. Moreover, he says that Melissa
was appointed by her father the first priestess of the Great Mother; from which circumstance
the priests of the same Mother are still called Melissæ. But the sacred history testifies that
Jupiter himself, when he had gained possession of power, arrived at such insolence that he
built temples in honour of himself in many places. For when he went about to different
lands, on his arrival in each region, he united to himself the kings or princes of the people
in hospitality and friendship; and when he was departing from each, he ordered that a shrine
should be dedicated to himself in the name of his host, as though the remembrance of their
friendship and league could thus be preserved. Thus temples were founded in honour of
Jupiter Atabyrius and Jupiter Labrandius; for Atabyrius and Labrandius were his entertainers
and assistants in war. Temples were also built to Jupiter Laprius, to Jupiter Molion, to Jupiter
Casius, and others, after the same manner. This was a very crafty device on his part, that he
might both acquire divine honour for himself, and a perpetual name for his entertainers in
conjunction with religious observances. Accordingly they were glad, and cheerfully submitted
to his command, and observed annual rites and festivals for the sake of handing down their
own name. Æneas did something like this in Sicily, when he gave the name of his host103
Acestes to a city which he had built, that Acestes might afterwards joyfully and willingly
love, increase, and adorn it. In this manner Jupiter spread abroad through the world the
observance of his worship, and gave an example for the imitation of others. Whether, then,
the practice of worshipping the gods proceeded from Melisseus, as Didymus related, or
from Jupiter also himself, as Euhemerus says, the time is still agreed upon when the gods
began to be worshipped. Melisseus, indeed, was much prior in time, inasmuch as he brought
up Jupiter his grandson. It is therefore possible that either before, or while Jupiter was yet
a boy, he taught the worship of the gods, namely, the mother of his foster-child, and his
grandmother Tellus, who was the wife of Uranus, and his father Saturnus; and he himself,
by this example and institution, may have exalted Jupiter to such pride, that he afterwards
ventured to assume divine honours to himself.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE AGES OF VAIN SUPERSTITIONS, AND THE TIMES AT
WHICH THEY COMMENCED.</head>
<p>Now, since we have ascertained the origin of vain superstitions, it remains that we should
also collect the times during which they whose memory is honoured lived. Theophilus,104
in his book written to Autolycus respecting the times,105 says that Thallus relates in his
history, that Belus, who is worshipped by the Babylonians and Assyrians, is found to have
lived 322 years before the Trojan war; that Belus, moreover, was contemporary with Saturnus,
and that they both grew up at one time;—which is so true, that it may be inferred by reason
itself. For Agamemnon, who carried on the Trojan war, was the fourth106 in descent from
Jupiter; and Achilles and Ajax were of the third107 descent from him; and Ulysses was related
in the same degree. Priam, indeed, was distant by a long series of descents. But according
to some authorities, Dardanus and Iasius were sons of Coritus, not of Jupiter. For if it had
been so, Jupiter could not have formed that unchaste connection with Ganymede, his own
descendant. Therefore, if you divide the years which are in agreement, the number will be
found in harmony with the parents of those whom I have named above. Now, from the destruction
of the Trojan city fourteen hundred and seventy years are made up. From this
calculation of times, it is manifest that Saturnus has not been born more than eighteen
hundred years, and he also was the father of all the gods. Let them not glory, then, in the
antiquity of their sacred rites, since both their origin and system and times have been ascertained.
There still remain some things which may be of great weight for the disproving of
false religions; but I have determined now to bring this book to an end, that it may not exceed
moderate limits. For those things must be followed up more fully, that, having refuted all
things which seem to oppose the truth, we may be able to instruct in true religion men who,
through ignorance of good things, wander in uncertainty. But the first step towards wisdom
is to understand what is false; the second, to ascertain what is true. Therefore he who shall
have profited by this first discussion of mine, in which we have exposed false things, will be
excited to the knowledge of the truth, than which no pleasure is more gratifying to man;
and he will now be worthy of the wisdom of heavenly training, who shall approach with
willingness and preparation to the knowledge of the other subjects.</p>

OF THE ORIGIN OF ERROR.</head>

<pb n="81"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—THAT FORGETFULNESS OF REASON MAKES MEN IGNORANT OF THE
TRUE GOD, WHOM THEY WORSHIP IN ADVERSITY AND DESPISE IN
PROSPERITY.</head>
<p>Although I have shown in the first book that the religious ceremonies of the gods are
false, because those in whose honour the general consent of men throughout the world by
a foolish persuasion undertook various and dissimilar rites were mortals, and when they
had completed their term of life, yielded to a divinely appointed necessity and died, yet, lest
any doubt should be left, this second book shall lay open the very fountain of errors, and
shall explain all the causes by which men were deceived, so that at first they believed that
they were gods, and afterwards with an inveterate persuasion persevered in the religious
observances which they had most perversely undertaken. For I desire, O Emperor
Constantine, now that I have proved the emptiness of these things, and brought to light the
impious vanity of men, to assert the majesty of the one God, undertaking the more useful
and greater duty of recalling men from crooked paths, and of bringing them back into favour
with themselves, that they may not, as some philosophers do, so greatly despise themselves,
nor think that they are weak and useless, and of no account, and altogether born in vain.
For this notion drives many to vicious pursuits. For while they imagine that we are a care
to no God, or that we are about to have no existence after death, they altogether give themselves
to the indulgence of their passions; and while they think that it is allowed them, they
eagerly apply themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures, by which they unconsciously run
into the snares of death; for they are ignorant as to what is reasonable conduct on the part
of man: for if they wished to understand this, in the first place they would acknowledge their
Lord, and would follow after virtue and justice; they would not subject their souls to the
influence of earth-born fictions, nor would they seek the deadly fascinations of their lusts;
in short, they would value themselves highly, and would understand that there is more in
man than appears; and that they cannot retain their power and standing unless men lay
aside depravity, and undertake the worship of their true Parent. I indeed, as I ought, often
reflecting on the sum of affairs, am accustomed to wonder that the majesty of the one God,
which keeps together and rules all things, has come to be so forgotten, that the only befitting
object of worship is, above all others, the one which is especially neglected; and that men
have sunk to such blindness, that they prefer the dead to the true and living God, and those
who are of the earth, and buried in the earth, to Him who was the Creator of the earth itself.</p>
<p>And yet this impiety of men might meet with some indulgence if the error entirely arose
from ignorance of the divine name. But since we often see that the worshippers of other
gods themselves confess and acknowledge the Supreme God, what pardon can they hope
for their impiety, who do not acknowledge the worship of Him whom man cannot altogether
be ignorant of? For both in swearing, and in expressing a wish, and in giving thanks, they

<pb n="82"/>
do not name Jupiter, or a number of gods, but God;108 so entirely does the truth of its own
accord break forth by the force of nature even from unwilling breasts. And this, indeed, is
not the case with men in their prosperity. For then most of all does God escape the memory
of men, when in the enjoyment of His benefits they ought to honour His divine beneficence.
But if any weighty necessity shall press them, then they remember God. If the terror of war
shall have resounded, if the pestilential force of diseases shall have overhung them, if long-
continued drought shall have denied nourishment to the crops, if a violent tempest or hail
shall have assailed them, they betake themselves to God, aid is implored from God, God is
entreated to succour them. If any one is tossed about on the sea, the wind being furious, it
is this God whom he invokes. If any one is harassed by any violence, he implores His aid. If
any one, reduced to the last extremity of poverty, begs for food, he appeals to God alone,
and by His divine and matchless name109 alone he seeks to gain the compassion of men.
Thus they never remember God, unless it be while they are in trouble. When fear has left
them, and the dangers have withdrawn, then in truth they quickly hasten to the temples of
the gods: they pour libations to them, they sacrifice to them, they crown110 them with garlands.
But to God, whom they called upon in their necessity itself, they do not give thanks
even in word. Thus from prosperity arises luxury; and from luxury, together with all other
vices, there arises impiety towards God.</p>
<p>From what cause can we suppose this to arise? Unless we imagine that there is some
perverse power which is always hostile to the truth, which rejoices in the errors of men,
whose one and only task it is perpetually to scatter darkness, and to blind the minds of men,
lest they should see the light,—lest, in short, they should look to heaven, and observe the
nature111 of their own body, the origin112 of which we shall relate at the proper place; but
now let us refute fallacies. For since other animals look down to the ground, with bodies
bending forward, because they have not received reason and wisdom, whereas an upright
position and an elevated countenance have been given to us by the Creator God, it is evident
that these ceremonies paid to the gods are not in accordance with the reason of man, because
they bend down the heaven-sprung being to the worship of earthly objects. For that one
and only Parent of ours, when He created man,—that is, an animal intelligent and capable

<note type="footnote">110 It was a custom among the heathen nations to crown the images of the gods with garlands of flowers.</note>
<note type="footnote">111 The allusion is to the upright attitude of man, as compared with other created beings. The argument is

<note type="footnote">112 This sentence is omitted in some editions.</note>

<pb n="83"/>
of exercising reason,—raised him from the ground, and elevated him to the contemplation
of his Creator. As an ingenious poet113 has well represented it:—
<lg>
<l>“And when other animals bend forward and look to the earth, He gave to man
an elevated countenance, and commanded him to look up to the
heaven, and to raise his countenance erect to stars.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>From this circumstance the Greeks plainly derived the name ἄνθρωπος,114 because he
looks upward. They therefore deny themselves, and renounce the name of man, who do not
look up, but downward: unless they think that the fact of our being upright is assigned to
man without any cause. God willed that we should look up to heaven, and undoubtedly not
without reason. For both the birds and almost all of the dumb creation see the heaven, but
it is given to us in a peculiar manner to behold the heaven as we stand erect, that we may
seek religion there; that since we cannot see God with our eyes, we may with our mind
contemplate Him, whose throne is there: and this cannot assuredly be done by him who
worships brass and stone, which are earthly things. But it is most incorrect that the nature
of the body, which is temporary, should be upright, but that the soul itself, which is eternal,
should be abject; whereas the figure and position have no other signification, except that
the mind of man ought to look in the same direction as his countenance, and that his soul
ought to be as upright as his body, so that it may imitate that which it ought to rule. But
men, forgetful both of their name and nature, cast down their eyes from the heaven, and fix
them upon the ground, and fear the works of their own hands, as though anything could
be greater than its own artificer.</p>

<head>CHAP. II.—WHAT WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF MAKING IMAGES; OF THE TRUE
LIKENESS OF GOD, AND THE TRUE WORSHIP OF HIM.</head>
<p>What madness is it, then, either to form those objects which they themselves may afterwards
fear, or to fear the things which they have formed? But, they say, we do not fear the
images themselves, but those beings after whose likeness they were formed, and to whose
names they are dedicated. You fear them doubtless on this account, because you think that
they are in heaven; for if they are gods, the case cannot be otherwise. Why, then, do you not
raise your eyes to heaven, and, invoking their names, offer sacrifices in the open air? Why
do you look to walls, and wood, and stone, rather than to the place where you believe them
to be? What is the meaning of temples115 and altars? what, in short, of the images themselves,
which are memorials either of the dead or absent? For the plan of making likenesses was
invented by men for this reason, that it might be possible to retain the memory of those
who had either been removed by death or separated by absence. In which of these classes,
then, shall we reckon the gods? If among the dead, who is so foolish as to worship them? If
among the absent, then they are not to be worshipped, if they neither see our actions nor
hear our prayers. But if the gods cannot be absent,—for, since they are divine, they see and
hear all things, in whatever part of the universe they are,—it follows that images are superfluous,
since the gods are present everywhere, and it is sufficient to invoke with prayer the
names of those who hear us. But if they are present, they cannot fail to be at hand at their
own images. It is entirely so, as the people imagine, that the spirits of the dead wander116
about the tombs and relics of their bodies. But after that the deity has begun to be near,
there is no longer need of his statue.</p>
<p>For I ask, if any one should often contemplate the likeness of a man who has settled in
a foreign land, that he may thus solace himself for him who is absent, would he also appear
to be of sound mind, if, when the other had returned and was present, he should persevere
in contemplating the likeness, and should prefer the enjoyment of it, rather than the sight
of the man himself? Assuredly not. For the likeness of a man appears to be necessary at that
time when he is far away; and it will become superfluous when he is at hand. But in the case
of God, whose spirit and influence are diffused everywhere, and can never be absent, it is
<note type="footnote">115 The word temples is not here applied to the buildings which the faithful set apart for the worship of God,
but to the places used by the heathens for their rites and sacrifices. [For three centuries templa was the word
among Christians for the idolatrous places.] That buildings were set apart by Christians from the earliest ages
for their religious assemblies, is gathered from the express testimony of Tertullian, Cyprian, and other early
writers. They were called ecclesiæ; churches, not temples. [For κυριακὸν, dominicum, basilica, etc., see Bingham,
book viii. cap i. sec. 2.]</note>
<note type="footnote">116 The heathens thought that the souls of the unburied dead wandered about on the earth, until their remains
were committed to the tomb.</note>

<pb n="85"/>
plain that an image is always superfluous. But they fear lest their religion should be altogether
vain and empty if they should see nothing present which they may adore, and therefore they
set up images; and since these are representations of the dead, they resemble the dead, for
they are entirely destitute of perception. But the image of the ever-living God ought to be
living and endued with perception. But if it received this name117 from resemblance, how
can it be supposed that these images resemble God, which have neither perception nor
motion? Therefore the image of God is not that which is fashioned by the fingers of men
out of stone, or bronze, or other material, but man himself, since he has both perception
and motion, and performs many and great actions. Nor do the foolish men understand,
that if images could exercise perception and motion, they would of their own accord adore
men, by whom they have been adorned and embellished, since they would be either rough
and unpolished stone, or rude and unshapen wood,118 had they not been fashioned by man.</p>
<p>Man, therefore, is to be regarded as the parent of these images; for they were produced
by his instrumentality, and through him they first had shape, figure, and beauty. Therefore
he who made them is superior to the objects which were made. And yet no one looks up to
the Maker Himself, or reverences Him: he fears the things which he has made, as though
there could be more power in the work than in the workman. Seneca, therefore, rightly says
in his moral treatises: They worship the images of the gods, they supplicate them with bended
knee, they adore them, they sit or stand beside them through the whole day, they offer to
them contributions,119 they slay victims; and while they value these images so highly, they
despise the artificers who made them. What is so inconsistent, as to despise the statuary and
to adore the statue; and not even to admit to your society him who makes your gods? What
force, what power can they have, when he who made them has none? But he was unable to
give to these even those powers which he had, the power of sight, of hearing, of speech, and
of motion. Is any one so foolish as to suppose that there is anything in the image of a god,
in which there is nothing even of a man except the mere resemblance? But no one considers
these things; for men are imbued with this persuasion, and their minds have thoroughly
imbibed the deception120 of folly. And thus beings endowed with sense adore objects which
are senseless, rational beings adore irrational objects, those who are alive adore inanimate
objects, those sprung from heaven adore earthly objects. It delights me, therefore, as though

standing on a lofty watch-tower, from which all may hear, to proclaim aloud that saying of
Persius:121—
<lg>
<l>“O souls bent down to the earth, and destitute of heavenly things?”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Rather look to the heaven, to the sight of which God your Creator raised you. He gave
to you an elevated countenance; you bend it down to the earth; you depress to things below
those lofty minds, which are raised together with their bodies to their parent, as though it
repented you that you were not born quadrupeds. It is not befitting that the heavenly being
should make himself equal to things which are earthly, and incline to the earth. Why do
you deprive yourselves of heavenly benefits, and of your own accord fall prostrate upon the
ground? For you do wretchedly roll yourselves122 on the ground, when you seek here below
that which you ought to have sought above. For as to those vain123 and fragile productions,
the work of man’s hands, from whatever kind of material they are formed, what are they
but earth, out of which they were produced? Why, then, do you subject yourselves to lower
objects? why do you place the earth above your heads? For when you lower yourselves to
the earth, and humiliate yourselves, you sink of your own accord to hell, and condemn
yourselves to death; for nothing is lower and more humble than the earth, except death and
hell. And if you wished to escape these, you would despise the earth lying beneath your feet,
preserving the position of your body, which you received upright, in order that you might
be able to direct your eyes and your mind to Him who made it. But to despise and trample
upon the earth is nothing else than to refrain from adoring images, because they are made
of earth; also not to desire riches, and to despise the pleasures of the body, because wealth,
and the body itself, which we make use of as a lodging, is but earth. Worship a living being,
that you may live; for he must necessarily die who has subjected124 himself and his soul to
the dead.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—THAT CICERO AND OTHER MEN OF LEARNING ERRED IN NOT
TURNING AWAY THE PEOPLE FROM ERROR.</head>
<p>But what does it avail thus to address the vulgar and ignorant, when we see that learned
and prudent men, though they understand the vanity of these ceremonies, nevertheless
through some perverseness persist in the worship of those very objects which they condemn?
Cicero was well aware that the deities which men worshipped were false. For when he had
spoken many things which tended to the overthrow of religious ceremonies, he said nevertheless
that these matters ought not to be discussed by the vulgar, lest such discussion should
extinguish the system of religion which was publicly received. What can you do respecting
him, who, when he perceives himself to be in error, of his own accord dashes himself against
the stones, that all the people may stumble? or tears out his own eyes, that all may be blind?
who neither deserves well of others, whom he suffers to be in error, nor of himself, since he
inclines to the errors of others, and makes no use of the benefit of his own wisdom, so as to
carry out125 in action the conception of his own mind, but knowingly and consciously
thrusts his foot into the snare, that he also may be taken with the rest, whom he ought, as
the more prudent, to have extricated? Nay rather, if you have any virtue, Cicero, endeavour
to make the people wise: that is a befitting subject, on which you may expend all the powers
of your eloquence. For there is no fear lest speech should fail you in so good a cause, when
you have often defended even bad ones with copiousness and spirit. But truly you fear the
prison of Socrates,126 and on that account you do not venture to undertake the advocacy
of truth. But, as a wise man, you ought to have despised death. And, indeed, it would have
been much more glorious to die on account of good words than on account of revilings.
Nor would the renown of your Philippics have been more advantageous to you than the
dispersion of the errors of mankind, and the recalling of the minds of men to a healthy state
by your disputation.</p>
<p>But let us make allowance for timidity, which ought not to exist in a wise man. Why,
then, are you yourself engaged in the same error? I see that you worship things of earth
made by the hand: you understand that they are vain, and yet you do the same things which
they do, whom you confess to be most foolish. What, therefore, did it profit you, that you
saw the truth, which you were neither about to defend nor to follow? If even they who perceive
themselves to be in error err willingly, how much more so do the unlearned vulgar,
who delight in empty processions, and gaze at all things with boyish minds! They are delighted
with trifling things, and are captivated with the form of images; and they are unable
<note type="footnote">125 Fill up and complete the outline which he has conceived.</note>
<note type="footnote">126 Lactantius charges Cicero with want of courage, in being unwilling to declare the truth to the Romans,
lest he should incur the peril of death. The fortitude with which Socrates underwent death, when condemned
by the Athenians, is related by Xenophon and Plato.</note>

<pb n="88"/>
to weigh every object in their own minds, so as to understand that nothing which is beheld
by the eyes of mortals ought to be worshipped, because it must necessarily be mortal. Nor
is it matter of surprise if they do not see God, when they themselves do not even see man,
whom they believe that they see. For this, which falls under the notice of the eyes,127 is not
man, but the receptacle of man, the quality and figure of which are not seen from the lineaments
of the vessel which contains them, but from the actions and character. They, therefore,
who worship images are mere bodies without men, because they have given themselves to
corporeal things, and do not see anything with the mind more than with the body; whereas
it is the office of the soul to perceive those things more clearly which the eye of the body
cannot behold. And that philosopher and poet severely accuses those men as humble and
abject, who, in opposition to the design of their nature, prostrate themselves to the worship
of earthly things; for he says:128—
<lg>
<l>“And they abase their souls with fear of the gods, and weigh and press them
down to earth.”</l>
</lg>
When he said these things, indeed, his meaning was different—that nothing was to be
worshipped, because the gods do not regard the affairs of men.</p>
<p>In another place, at length, he acknowledges that the ceremonies and worship of the
gods is an unavailing office:129—
<lg>
<l>“Nor is it any piety to be often seen with veiled head to turn to a stone, and approach
every altar, and fall prostrate on the ground, and spread the
hands before the shrines of the gods, and sprinkle the altars with much
blood of beasts, and to offer vow after vow.”</l>
</lg>
And assuredly if these things are useless, it is not right that sublime and lofty souls should
be called away and depressed to the earth, but that they should think only of heavenly things.</p>
<p>False religious systems, therefore, have been attacked by more sagacious men, because
they perceived their falsehood; but the true religion was not introduced, because they knew
not what and where it was. They therefore so regarded it as though it had no existence, because
they were unable to find it in its truth. And in this manner they fell into a much
<note type="footnote">127 Lactantius here follows Plato, who placed the essence of man in the intellectual soul. The body, however,
as well as the soul, is of the essence of man; but Lactantius seems to limit the name of man to the higher and

greater error than they who held a religion which was false. For those worshippers of fragile
images, however foolish they may be, inasmuch as they place heavenly things in things
which are earthly and corruptible, yet retain something of wisdom, and may be pardoned,
because they hold the chief duty of man, if not in reality, yet still in their purpose; since, if
not the only, yet certainly the greatest difference between men and the beasts consists in
religion. But this latter class, in proportion to their superior wisdom, in that they understood
the error of false religion, rendered themselves so much the more foolish, because they did
not imagine that some religion was true. And thus, because it is easier to judge of the affairs
of others than of their own, while they see the downfall of others, they have not observed
what was before their own feet. On either side is found the greatest folly, and a certain
trace130 of wisdom; so that you may doubt which are rather to be called more foolish—those
who embrace a false religion, or those who embrace none. But (as I have said) pardon may
be granted to those who are ignorant and do not own themselves to be wise; but it cannot
be extended to those who, while they profess131 wisdom, rather exhibit folly. I am not, indeed,
so unjust as to imagine that they could divine, so that they might find out the truth by
themselves; for I acknowledge that this is impossible. But I require from them that which
they were able to perform by reason132 itself. For they would act more prudently, if they
both understood that some form of religion is true, and if, while they attacked false religions,
they openly proclaimed that men were not in possession of that which is true.</p>
<p>But this consideration may perhaps have influenced them, that if there were any true
religion, it would exert itself and assert its authority, and not permit the existence of anything
opposed to it. For they were unable to see at all, on what account, or by whom, and in what
manner true religion was depressed, which partakes of a divine mystery133 and a heavenly
secret. And no man can know134 this by any means, unless he is taught. The sum of the
matter is this: The unlearned and the foolish esteem false religions as true, because they
neither know the true nor understand the false.135 But the more sagacious, because they are
ignorant of the true, either persist in those religions which they know to be false, that they
may appear to possess something; or worship nothing at all, that they may not fall into error,
whereas this very thing partakes largely of error, under the figure of a man to imitate the
life of cattle. To understand that which is false is truly the part of wisdom, but of human

wisdom. Beyond this step man cannot proceed, and thus many of the philosophers have
taken away religious institutions, as I have pointed out; but to know the truth is the part of
divine wisdom. But man by himself cannot attain to this knowledge, unless he is taught by
God. Thus philosophers have reached the height of human wisdom, so as to understand
that which is not; but they have failed in attaining the power of saying that which really is.
It is a well-known saying of Cicero:136 “I wish that I could as easily find out the truth as I
can refute false things.” And because this is beyond the power of man’s condition, the capability
of this office is assigned to us, to whom God has delivered the knowledge of the truth;
to the explaining of which the four last books shall be devoted. Now, in the meantime, let
us bring to light false things, as we have begun to do.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—OF IMAGES, AND THE ORNAMENTS OF TEMPLES, AND THE

<p>What majesty, then, can images have, which were altogether in the power of puny man,
either that they should be formed into something else, or that they should not be made at
all? On which account Priapus thus speaks in Horace:137

<l>“Formerly I was the trunk of a fig-tree,138 a useless log, when the carpenter, at
a loss whether he should make a bench or a Priapus, decided that it
should be a god. Accordingly I am a god, a very great terror to thieves
and birds.”</l>
</lg>
Who would not be at ease with such a guardian as this? For thieves are so foolish as to fear
the figure of Priapus; though the very birds, which they imagine to be driven away by fear
of his scythe, settle upon the images which are skilfully made, that is, which altogether resemble
men, build their nests there, and defile them. But Flaccus, as a writer of satire, ridiculed
the folly of men. But they who make the images fancy that they are performing a
serious business. In short, that very great poet, a man of sagacity in other things, in this
alone displayed folly, not like a poet, but after the manner of an old woman, when even in
those most highly-finished139 books he orders this to be done:—
<lg>
<l>“And let the guardianship of Priapus of the Hellespont,140 who drives away
thieves and birds with his willow scythe, preserve them.”</l>
</lg>
Therefore they adore mortal things, as made by mortals. For they may be broken, or burnt,
or be destroyed. For they are often apt to be broken to pieces, when houses fall through age,
and when, consumed by conflagration, they waste away to ashes; and in many instances,
unless aided by their own magnitude, or protected by diligent watchfulness, they become
the prey of thieves. What madness is it, then, to fear those objects for which either the
downfall of a building, or fires, or thefts, may be feared! What folly, to hope for protection
from those things which are unable to protect themselves! What perversity, to have recourse
to the guardianship of those which, when injured, are themselves unavenged, unless vengeance
is exacted by their worshippers! Where, then, is truth? Where no violence can be

can be committed.</p>
<p>But whatever is subjected to the eyes and to the hands, that, in truth, because it is perishable,
is inconsistent with the whole subject of immortality. It is in vain, therefore, that
men set off and adorn their gods with gold, ivory, and jewels, as though they were capable
of deriving any pleasure from these things. What is the use of precious gifts to insensible
objects? Is it the same which the dead have? For as they embalm the bodies of the dead,
wrap them in spices and precious garments, and bury them in the earth, so they honour the
gods, who when they were made did not perceive it, and when they are worshipped have
no knowledge of it; for they did not receive sensibility on their consecration. Persius was
displeased that golden vessels should be carried into the temples, since he thought it superfluous
that that should be reckoned among religious offerings which was not an instrument
of sanctity, but of avarice. For these are the things which it is better to offer as a gift to the
god whom you would rightly worship:—
<lg>
<l>“Written law141 and the divine law of the conscience, and the sacred recesses of
the mind, and the breast imbued with nobleness.”142</l>
</lg>
A noble and wise sentiment. But he ridiculously added this: that there is this gold in the
temples, as there are dolls143 presented to Venus by the virgin; which perhaps he may have
despised on account of their smallness. For he did not see that the very images and statues
of the gods, wrought in gold and ivory by the hand of Polycletus, Euphranor, and Phidias,
were nothing more than large dolls, not dedicated by virgins, to whose sports some indulgence
may be granted, but by bearded men. Therefore Seneca deservedly laughs at the folly
even of old men. We are not (he says) boys twice,144 as is commonly said, but are always
so. But there is this difference, that when men we have greater subjects of sport. Therefore
men offer to these dolls, which are of large size, and adorned as though for the stage, both
perfumes, and incense, and odours: they sacrifice to these costly and fattened victims, which
have a mouth,145 but one that is not suitable for eating; to these they bring robes and costly

garments, though they have no need of clothing; to these they dedicate gold and silver, of
which they who receive them are as destitute146 as they who have given them.</p>
<p>And not without reason did Dionysius, the despot of Sicily, when after a victory he had
become master of Greece,147 despise, and plunder and jeer at such gods, for he followed up
his sacrilegious acts by jesting words. For when he had taken off a golden robe from the
statue of the Olympian Jupiter, he ordered that a woollen garment should be placed upon
him, saying that a golden robe was heavy in summer and cold in winter, but that a woollen
one was adapted to each season. He also took off the golden beard from Æsculapius, saying
that it was unbecoming and unjust, that while his father Apollo was yet smooth and beardless,
the son should be seen to wear a beard before his father. He also took away the bowls, and
spoils, and some little images148 which were held in the extended hands of the statues, and
said that he did not take them away, but received them: for that it would be very foolish and
ungrateful to refuse to receive good things, when offered voluntarily by those from whom
men were accustomed to implore them. He did these things with impunity, because he was
a king and victorious. Moreover, his usual good fortune also followed him; for he lived even
to old age, and handed down the kingdom in succession to his son. In his case, therefore,
because men could not punish his sacrilegious deeds, it was befitting that the gods should
be their own avengers. But if any humble person shall have committed any such crime, there
are at hand for his punishment the scourge, fire, the rack,149 the cross, and whatever torture
men can invent in their anger and rage. But when they punish those who have been detected
in the act of sacrilege, they themselves distrust the power of their gods. For why should they
not leave to them especially the opportunity of avenging themselves, if they think that they
are able to do so? Moreover, they also imagine that it happened through the will of the
deities that the sacrilegious robbers were discovered and arrested; and their cruelty is instigated
not so much by anger as by fear, lest they themselves should be visited with punishment
if they failed to avenge the injury done to the gods. And, in truth, they display incredible
shallowness in imagining that the gods will injure them on account of the guilt of others,
who by themselves were unable to injure those very persons by whom they were profaned
and plundered. But, in fact, they have often themselves also inflicted punishment on the
sacrilegious: that may have occurred even by chance, which has sometimes happened, but
not always. But I will show presently how that occurred. Now in the meantime I will ask,

Why did they not punish so many and such great acts of sacrilege in Dionysius, who insulted
the gods openly, and not in secret? Why did they not repel this sacrilegious man, possessed
of such power, from their temples, their ceremonies, and their images? Why, even when he
had carried off their sacred things, had he a prosperous voyage—as he himself, according
to his custom, testified in joke? Do you see, he said to his companions who feared shipwreck,
how prosperous a voyage the immortal gods themselves give to the sacrilegious? But perhaps
he had learnt from Plato that the gods have no150 power.</p>
<p>What of Caius Verres? whom his accuser Tully compares to this same Dionysius, and
to Phalaris, and to all tyrants. Did he not pillage the whole of Sicily, carrying away the images
of the gods, and the ornaments of the temples? It is idle to follow up each particular instance:
I would fain make mention of one, in which the accuser, with all the force of eloquence—in
short, with every effort of voice and of body—lamented about Ceres of Catina, or of Henna:
the one of whom was of such great sanctity, that it was unlawful for men to enter the secret
recesses of her temple; the other was of such great antiquity, that all accounts relate that the
goddess herself first discovered grain in the soil of Henna, and that her virgin daughter was
carried away from the same place. Lastly, in the times of the Gracchi, when the state was
disturbed both by seditions and by portents, on its being discovered in the Sibylline predictions
that the most ancient Ceres ought to be appeased, ambassadors were sent to Henna.
This Ceres, then, either the most holy one, whom it was unlawful for men to behold even
for the sake of adoration, or the most ancient one, whom the senate and people of Rome
had appeased with sacrifices and gifts, was carried away with impunity by Caius Verres from
her secret and ancient recesses, his robber slaves having been sent in. The same orator, in
truth, when he affirmed that he had been entreated by the Sicilians to undertake the cause
of the province, made use of these words: “That they had now not even any gods in their
cities to whom they might betake themselves, since Verres had taken away the most sacred
images from their most venerable shrines.” As though, in truth, if Verres had taken them
away from the cities and shrines, he had also taken them from heaven. From which it appears
that those gods have nothing in them more than the material of which they are made. And
not without reason did the Sicilians have recourse to you, O Marcus Tullius, that is, to a
man; since they had for three years experienced that those gods had no power. For they
would have been most foolish if they had fled for protection against the injuries of men, to
those who were unable to be angry with Caius Verres on their own behalf. But, it will be
urged, Verres was condemned on account of these deeds. Therefore he was not punished
<note type="footnote">150 Nihil esse [= are nothing.]</note>

<pb n="95"/>
by the gods, but by the energy of Cicero, by which he either crushed his defenders or withstood
his influence.151 Why should I say that, in the case of Verres himself, that was not so
much a condemnation as a respite from labour? So that, as the immortal gods had given a
prosperous voyage to Dionysius when he was carrying off the spoils of gods, so also they
appear to have bestowed on Verres quiet repose, in which he might with tranquility enjoy
the fruits of his sacrilege. For when civil wars afterwards raged, being removed from all
danger and apprehension, under the cloak of condemnation he heard of the disastrous
misfortunes and miserable deaths of others; and he who appeared to have fallen while all
retained their position, he alone, in truth, retained his position while all fell; until the proscription
of the triumvirs,—that very proscription, indeed, which carried off Tully, the
avenger of the violated majesty of the gods,—carried him off, satiated at once with the enjoyment
of the wealth which he had gained by sacrilege, and with life, and worn out by old
age. Moreover, he was fortunate in this very circumstance, that before his own death he
heard of the most cruel end of his accuser; the gods doubtless providing that this sacrilegious
man and spoiler of their worship should not die before he had received consolation from
revenge.</p>
<note type="footnote">151 The allusion is to the efforts made by the partisans of Verres to prevent Cicero from obtaining the necessary
evidence for the condemnation of Verres. But all these efforts were unavailing: the evidence was overwhelming,
and before the trial was over Verres went into exile.</note>

<head>CHAP. V.—THAT GOD ONLY, THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS, IS TO BE
WORSHIPPED, AND NOT THE ELEMENTS OR HEAVENLY BODIES; AND THE
OPINION OF THE STOICS IS REFUTED, WHO THINK THAT THE STARS AND
PLANETS ARE GODS.</head>
<p>How much better, therefore, is it, leaving vain and insensible objects, to turn our eyes
in that direction where is the seat and dwelling-place of the true God; who suspended the
earth152 on a firm foundation, who bespangled the heaven with shining stars; who lighted
up the sun, the most bright and matchless light for the affairs of men, in proof of His own
single majesty; who girded the earth with seas, and ordered the rivers to flow with perpetual
course!
<lg>
<l>“He also commanded the plains to extend themselves, the valleys to sink down,
the woods to be covered with foliage, the stony mountains to rise.”153</l>
</lg>
All these things truly were not the work of Jupiter, who was born seventeen hundred years
ago; but of the same, “that framer of all things, the origin of a better world,”154 who is called
God, whose beginning cannot be comprehended, and ought not to be made the subject of
inquiry. It is sufficient for man, to his full and perfect wisdom, if he understands the existence
of God: the force and sum of which understanding is this, that he look up to and honour
the common Parent of the human race, and the Maker of wonderful things. Whence some
persons of dull and obtuse mind adore as gods the elements, which are both created objects
and are void of sensibility; who, when they admired the works of God, that is, the heaven
with its various lights, the earth with its plains and mountains, the seas with their rivers and
lakes and fountains, struck with admiration of these things, and forgetting the Maker
Himself, whom they were unable to see, began to adore and worship His works. Nor were
they able at all to understand how much greater and more wonderful He is, who made these
things out of nothing. And when they see that these things, in obedience to divine laws, by
a perpetual necessity are subservient to the uses and interests of men, they nevertheless regard
them as gods, being ungrateful towards the divine bounty, so that they preferred their own
works to their most indulgent God and Father. But what wonder is it if uncivilized or ignorant
men err, since even philosophers of the Stoic sect are of the same opinion, so as to judge
that all the heavenly bodies which have motion are to be reckoned in the number of gods;
inasmuch as the Stoic Lucilius thus speaks in Cicero:155 “This regularity, therefore, in the
stars, this great agreement of the times in such various courses during all eternity, are unin-

telligible to me with out the exercise of mind, reason, and design; and when we see these
things in the constellations, we cannot but place these very objects in the number of the
gods.” And he thus speaks a little before: “It remains,” he says, “that the motion of the stars
is voluntary; and he who sees these things, would act not only unlearnedly, but also impiously,
if he should deny it.” We in truth firmly deny it; and we prove that you, O philosophers, are
not only unlearned and impious, but also blind, foolish, and senseless, who have surpassed
in shallowness the ignorance of the uneducated. For they regard as gods only the sun and
moon, but you the stars also.</p>
<p>Make known to us, therefore, the mysteries of the stars, that we may erect altars and
temples to each; that we may know with what rites and on what day to worship each, with
what names and with what prayers we should call on them; unless perhaps we ought to
worship gods so innumerable without any discrimination, and gods so minute in a mass.
Why should I mention that the argument by which they infer that all the heavenly bodies
are gods, tends to the opposite conclusion? For if they imagine that they are gods on this
account, because they have their courses fixed and in accordance with reason, they are in
error. For it is evident from this that they are not gods, because it is not permitted them to
deviate156 from their prescribed orbits. But if they were gods, they would be borne hither
and thither in all directions without any necessity, as living creatures on the earth, who
wander hither and thither as they please, because their wills are unrestrained, and each is
borne wherever inclination may have led it. Therefore the motion of the stars is not voluntary,
but of necessity, because they obey157 the laws appointed for them. But when he was arguing
about the courses of the stars, while he understood from the very harmony of things and
times that they were not by chance, he judged that they were voluntary; as though they could
not be moved with such order and arrangement, unless they contained within them an understanding
acquainted with its own duty. Oh, how difficult is truth to those who are ignorant
of it! how easy to those who know it! If, he says, the motions of the stars are not by chance,
nothing else remains but that they are voluntary; nay, in truth, as it is plain that they are not
by chance, so is it clear that they are not voluntary. Why, then, in completing their courses,
do they preserve their regularity? Undoubtedly God, the framer of the universe, so arranged
and contrived them, that they might run through their courses158 in the heaven with a divine
and wonderful order, to accomplish the variations of the successive seasons. Was
Archimedes159 of Sicily able to contrive a likeness and representation of the universe in

hollow brass, in which he so arranged the sun and moon, that they effected, as it were every
day, motions unequal and resembling the revolutions of the heavens, and that sphere, while
it revolved,160 exhibited not only the approaches and withdrawings of the sun, or the increase
and waning of the moon, but also the unequal courses of the stars, whether fixed or wandering?
Was it then impossible for God to plan and create the originals,161 when the skill of
man was able to represent them by imitation? Would the Stoic, therefore, if he should have
seen the figures of the stars painted and fashioned in that brass, say that they moved by their
own design, and not by the genius of the artificer? There is therefore in the stars design,
adapted to the accomplishment of their courses; but it is the design of God, who both made
and governs all things, not of the stars themselves, which are thus moved. For if it had been
His will that the sun should remain162 fixed, it is plain that there would be perpetual day.
Also if the stars had no motions, who doubts that there would have been eternal night? But
that there might be vicissitudes of day and night, it was His will that the stars should move,
and move with such variety that there might not only be mutual interchanges of light and
darkness, by which alternate courses163 of labour and rest might be established, but also
interchanges of cold and heat, that the power and influence of the different seasons might
be adapted either to the production or the ripening of the crops. And because philosophers
did not see this skill of the divine power in contriving the movements of the stars, they
supposed them to be living, as though they moved with feet and of their own accord, and
not by the divine intelligence. But who does not understand why God contrived them?
Doubtless lest, as the light of the sun was withdrawn, a night of excessive darkness should
become too oppressive with its foul and dreadful gloom, and should be injurious to the living.
And so He both bespangled the heaven with wondrous variety, and tempered the darkness
itself with many and minute lights. How much more wisely therefore does Naso judge, than
they who think that they are devoting themselves to the pursuit of wisdom, in thinking that
those lights were appointed by God to remove the gloom of darkness! He concludes the
book, in which he briefly comprises the phenomena of nature, with these three verses:—
<lg>
<l>“These images, so many in number, and of such a figure, God placed in the
heaven; and having scattered them through the gloomy darkness, He
ordered them to give a bright light to the frosty night.”</l>

But if it is impossible that the stars should be gods, it follows that the sun and moon cannot
be gods, since they differ from the light of the stars in magnitude only, and not in their
design. And if these are not gods, the same is true of the heaven, which contains them all.</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.—THAT NEITHER THE WHOLE UNIVERSE NOR THE ELEMENTS ARE
GOD, NOR ARE THEY POSSESSED OF LIFE.</head>
<p>In like manner, if the land on which we tread, and which we subdue and cultivate for
food, is not a god, then the plains and mountains will not be gods; and if these are not so,
it follows that the whole of the earth cannot appear to be God. In like manner, if the water,
which is adapted to the wants164 of living creatures for the purpose of drinking and bathing,
is not a god, neither are the fountains gods from which the water flows. And if the fountains
are not gods, neither are the rivers, which are collected from the fountains. And if the rivers
also are not gods, it follows that the sea, which is made up of rivers, cannot be considered
as God. But if neither the heaven, nor the earth, nor the sea, which are the parts of the world,
can be gods, it follows that the world altogether is not God; whereas the same Stoics contend
that it is both living and wise, and therefore God. But in this they are so inconsistent, that
nothing is said by them which they do not also overthrow. For they argue thus: It is impossible
that that which produces from itself sensible objects should itself be insensible. But the world
produces man, who is endowed with sensibility; therefore it must also itself be sensible. Also
they argue: that cannot be without sensibility, a part of which is sensible; therefore, because
man is sensible, the world, of which man is a part, also possesses sensibility. The propositions165
themselves are true, that that which produces a being endowed with sense is itself
sensible; and that that possesses sense, a part of which is endowed with sense. But the assumptions
by which they draw their conclusions are false; for the world does not produce
man, nor is man a part of the world. For the same God who created the world, also created
man from the beginning: and man is not a part of the world, in the same manner in which
a limb is a part of the body; for it is possible for the world to be without man, as it is for a
city or house. Now, as a house is the dwelling-place of one man, and a city of one people,
so also the world is the abode166 of the whole human race; and that which is inhabited is
one thing, that which inhabits another. But these persons, in their eagerness to prove that
which they had falsely assumed, that the world is possessed of sensibility, and is God, did
not perceive the consequences of their own arguments. For if man is a part of the world,
and if the world is endowed with sensibility because man is sensible, therefore it follows
that, because man is mortal, the world must also of necessity be mortal, and not only mortal,
<note type="footnote">164 Is subservient to.</note>

call the major proposition, as containing the major term: the word assumption expresses that which is called

<note type="footnote">166 Thus Cicero, De Finibus, iii., says: “But they think that the universe is governed by the power of the gods,
and that it is, as it were, a city and state common to men and gods, and that every one of us is a part of that
universe.”</note>

but also liable to all kinds of disease and suffering. And, on the contrary, if the world is God,
its parts also are plainly immortal: therefore man also is God, because he is, as you say, a
part of the world. And if man, then also both beasts of burden and cattle, and the other
kinds of beasts and of birds, and fishes, since these also in the same manner are possessed
of sensibility, and are parts of the world. But this is endurable; for the Egyptians worship
even these. But the matter comes to this: that even frogs, and gnats, and ants appear to be
gods, because these also have sensibility, and are parts of the world. Thus arguments drawn
from a false source always lead to foolish and absurd conclusions. Why should I mention
that the same philosophers assert that the world was constructed167 for the sake of gods and
men as a common dwelling? Therefore the world is neither god, nor living, if it has been
made: for a living creature is not made, but born; and if it has been built, it has been built
as a house or ship is built. Therefore there is a builder of the world, even God; and the world
which has been made is distinct from Him who made it. Now, how inconsistent and absurd
is it, that when they affirm that the heavenly fires168 and the other elements of the world
are gods, they also say that the world itself is God! How is it possible that out of a great heap
of gods one God can be made up? If the stars are gods, it follows that the world is not God,
but the dwelling-place of gods. But if the world is God, it follows that all the things which
are in it are not gods, but members169 of God, which clearly cannot by themselves170 take
the name of God. For no one can rightly say that the members of one man are many men;
but, however, there is no similar comparison between a living being and the world. For because
a living being is endowed with sensibility, its members also have sensibility; nor do
they become senseless171 unless they are separated from the body. But what resemblance
does the world present to this? Truly they themselves tell us, since they do not deny that it
was made, that it might be, as it were, a common abode for gods and men. If, therefore, it
has been constructed as an abode, it is neither itself God, nor are the elements which are its
parts; because a house cannot bear rule over itself, nor can the parts of which a house consists.
Therefore they are refuted not only by the truth, but even by their own words. For as a house,
made for the purpose of being inhabited, has no sensibility by itself, and is subject to the
master who built or inhabits it; so the world, having no sensibility of itself, is subject to God
its Maker, who made it for His own use.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF GOD, AND THE RELIGIOUS RITES OF THE FOOLISH; OF

<p>The foolish, therefore, err in a twofold manner: first, in preferring the elements, that is,
the works of God, to God Himself; secondly, in worshipping the figures of the elements
themselves under human form. For they form the images of the sun and moon after the
fashion of men; also those of fire, and earth, and sea, which they call Vulcan, Vesta, and
Neptune. Nor do they openly sacrifice to the elements themselves. Men are possessed with
so great a fondness for representations,172 that those things which are true are now esteemed
of less value: they are delighted, in fact, with gold, and jewels, and ivory. The beauty and
brilliancy of these things dazzle their eyes, and they think that there is no religion where
these do not shine. And thus, under pretence of worshipping the gods, avarice and desire
are worshipped. For they believe that the gods love whatever they themselves desire, whatever
it is, on account of which thefts and robberies and murders daily rage, on account of which
wars overthrow nations and cities throughout the whole world. Therefore they consecrate
their spoils and plunder to the gods, who must undoubtedly be weak, and destitute of the
highest excellence, if they are subject to desires. For why should we think them celestial if
they long for anything from the earth, or happy if they are in want of anything, or uncorrupted
if they take pleasure in those things in the pursuit of which the desire of men is not unreservedly
condemned? They approach the gods, therefore not so much on account of religion,
which can have no place in badly acquired and corruptible things, as that they may
gaze upon173 the gold, and view the brilliancy of polished marble or ivory, that they may
survey with unwearied contemplation garments adorned with precious stones and colours,
or cups studded with glittering jewels. And the more ornamented are the temples, and the
more beautiful the images, so much the greater majesty are they believed to have: so entirely
is their religion confined174 to that which the desire of men admires.</p>
<p>These are the religious institutions handed down to them by their ancestors, which they
persist in maintaining and defending with the greatest obstinacy. Nor do they consider of
what character they are; but they feel assured of their excellence and truth on this account,
because the ancients have handed them down; and so great is the authority of antiquity,
that it is said to be a crime to inquire into it. And thus it is everywhere believed as ascertained
truth. In short, in Cicero,175 Cotta thus speaks to Lucilius: “You know, Balbus, what is the

opinion of Cotta, what the opinion of the pontiff. Now let me understand what are your
sentiments: for since you are a philosopher, I ought to receive from you a reason for your
religion; but in the case of our ancestors it is reasonable to believe them, though no reason
is alleged by them.” If you believe, why then do you require a reason, which may have the
effect of causing you not to believe? But if you require a reason, and think that the subject
demands inquiry, then you do not believe; for you make inquiry with this view, that you
may follow it when you have ascertained it. Behold, reason teaches you that the religious
institutions of the gods are not true: what will you do? Will you prefer to follow antiquity
or reason? And this, indeed, was not imparted176 to you by another, but was found out and
chosen by yourself, since you have entirely uprooted all religious systems. If you prefer
reason, you must abandon the institutions and authority of our ancestors, since nothing is
right but that which reason prescribes. But if piety advises you to follow your ancestors,
then admit that they were foolish, who complied with religious institutions invented contrary
to reason; and that you are senseless, since you worship that which you have proved to be
false. But since the name of ancestors is so greatly objected to us, let us see, I pray, who those
ancestors were from whose authority it is said to be impious to depart.177</p>
<p>Romulus, when he was about to found the city, called together the shepherds among
whom he had grown up; and since their number appeared inadequate to the founding of
the city, he established an asylum. To this all the most abandoned men flocked together indiscriminately
from the neighbouring places, without any distinction of condition. Thus he
brought together the people from all these; and he chose into the senate those who were
oldest, and called them Fathers, by whose advice he might direct all things. And concerning
this senate, Propertius the elegiac poet thus speaks:—
<lg>
<l>“The trumpet used to call the ancient Quirites to an assembly;178 those hundred
in the field often formed the senate. The senate-house, which now is
raised aloft and shines with the well-robed senate, received the Fathers
clothed in skins, rustic spirits.”</l>
</lg>
These are the Fathers whose decrees learned and sagacious men obey with the greatest devotion;
and all posterity must judge that to be true and unchangeable which an hundred
old men clothed in skins established at their will; who, however, as has been mentioned in
the first book,179 were enticed by Pompilius to believe the truth of those sacred rites which
he himself delivered. Is there any reason why their authority should be so highly esteemed

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE USE OF REASON IN RELIGION; AND OF DREAMS,
AUGURIES, ORACLES, AND SIMILAR PORTENTS.</head>
<p>It is therefore right, especially in a matter on which the whole plan of life turns, that
every one should place confidence in himself, and use his own judgment and individual
capacity for the investigation and weighing of the truth, rather than through confidence in
others to be deceived by their errors, as though he himself were without understanding.
God has given wisdom to all alike,181 that they might be able both to investigate things
which they have not heard, and to weigh things which they have heard. Nor, because they
preceded us in time, did they also outstrip us in wisdom; for if this is given equally to all,
we cannot be anticipated182 in it by those who precede us. It is incapable of diminution, as
the light and brilliancy of the sun; because, as the sun is the light of the eyes, so is wisdom
the light of man’s heart. Wherefore, since wisdom—that is, the inquiry after truth—is natural
to all, they deprive themselves of wisdom, who without any judgment approve of the
discoveries of their ancestors, and like sheep are led by others. But this escapes their notice,
that the name of ancestors being introduced, they think it impossible that they themselves
should have more knowledge because they are called descendants, or that the others should
be unwise because they are called ancestors.183 What, therefore, prevents us from taking a
precedent184 from them, that as they handed down to posterity their false inventions, so we
who have discovered the truth may hand down better things to our posterity? There remains
therefore a great subject of inquiry, the discussion of which does not come from talent, but
from knowledge: and this must be explained at greater length, that nothing at all may be
left in doubt. For perhaps some one may have recourse to those things which are handed
down by many and undoubted authorities; that those very persons, whom we have shown
to be no gods, have often displayed their majesty both by prodigies, and dreams, and auguries,
and oracles. And, indeed, many wonderful things may be enumerated, and especially this,
that Accius Navius, a consummate augur, when he was warning Tarquinius Priscus to undertake
the commencement of nothing new without the previous sanction of auguries,185
and the king, detracting from186 the credit due to his art, told him to consult the birds, and
<note type="footnote">181 Pro virili portione. The phrase properly denotes the share that falls to a person in the division of an inheritance,

does not reproduce. The word translated ancestors may also mean “men who are greater or superior:” the word

then to announce to him whether it was possible for that which he himself had conceived
in his mind to be accomplished, and Navius affirmed that it was possible; then take this
whetstone, he said, and divide it with a razor. But the other without any hesitation took and
cut it.</p>
<p>In the next place is the fact of Castor and Pollux having been seen in the Latin war at
the lake of Juturna washing off the sweat of their horses, when their temple which adjoins
the fountain had been open of its own accord. In the Macedonian war the same deities,
mounted on white horses, are said to have presented themselves to Publius Vatienus as he
went to Rome at night, announcing that King Perseus had been vanquished and taken captive
on that day, the truth of which was proved by letters received from Paulus187 a few days
afterwards. That also is wonderful, that the statue of Fortune, in the form188 of a woman,
is reported to have spoken more than once; also that the statue of Juno Moneta,189 when,
on the capture of Veii, one of the soldiers, being sent to remove it, sportively and in jest
asked whether she wished to remove to Rome, answered that she wished it. Claudia also is
set forth as an example of a miracle. For when, in accordance with the Sibylline books, the
Idæan mother was sent for, and the ship in which she was conveyed had grounded on a
shoal of the river Tiber, and could not be moved by any force, they report that Claudia, who
had been always regarded as unchaste on account of her excess in personal adornment, with
bended knees entreated the goddess, if she judged her to be chaste, to follow her girdle; and
thus the ship, which could not be moved by all the strong men,190 was moved by a single
woman. It is equally wonderful, that during the prevalence of a pestilence, Æsculapius, being
called from Epidaurus, is said to have released the city of Rome from the long-continued
plague.</p>
<p>Sacrilegious persons can also be mentioned, by the immediate punishment of whom
the gods are believed to have avenged the injury done to them. Appius Claudius the censor
having, against the advice of the oracle, transferred the sacred rites of Hercules to the public
slaves,191 was deprived of his eyesight; and the Potitian gens, which abandoned192 its privilege,
within the space of one year became extinct. Likewise the censor Fulvius, when he had
taken away the marble tiles from the temple of the Lacinian193 Juno, to cover the temple of
the equestrian Fortuna, which he had built at Rome, was deprived of his senses, and having

lost his two sons who were serving in Illyricum, was consumed with the greatest grief of
mind. Turullius also, the lieutenant of Mark Antony, when he had cut down a grove of
Æsculapius in Cos,194 and built a fleet, was afterwards slain at the same place by the soldiers
of Cæsar. To these examples is added Pyrrhus, who, having taken away money from the
treasure of the Locrian Proserpine, was shipwrecked, and dashed against the shores near to
the temple of the goddess, so that nothing was found uninjured except that money. Ceres
of Miletus also gained for herself great veneration among men. For when the city had been
taken by Alexander, and the soldiers had rushed in to plunder her temple, a flame of fire
suddenly thrown upon them blinded them all.</p>
<p>There are also found dreams which seem to show the power of the gods. For it is said
that Jupiter presented himself to Tiberius Atinius, a plebeian, in his sleep, and enjoined him
to announce to the consuls and senate, that in the last Circensian195 games a public dancer
had displeased him, because a certain Antonius Maximus had severely scourged a slave
under the furca196 in the middle of the circus, and had led him to punishment, and that on
this account the games ought to be repeated. And when he had neglected this command,
he is said on the same day to have lost his son, and to have been himself seized by a severe
disease; and that when he again perceived the same image asking whether he had suffered
sufficient punishment for the neglect of his command, he was carried on a litter to the
consuls; and having explained the whole matter in the senate, he regained strength of body,
and returned to his house on foot. And that dream also was not less wonderful, to which it
is said that Augustus Cæsar owed his preservation. For when in the civil war with Brutus
he was afflicted with a severe disease, and had determined to abstain from battle, the image
of Minerva presented itself to his physician Artorius, advising him that Cæsar should not
confine himself to the camp on account of his bodily infirmity. He was therefore carried on
a litter to the army, and on the same day the camp was taken by Brutus. Many other examples
of a similar nature may be brought forward; but I fear that, if I shall delay too long in the
setting forth of contrary subjects, I may either appear to have forgotten my purpose, or may
incur the charge of loquacity.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE DEVIL, THE WORLD, GOD, PROVIDENCE, MAN, AND HIS
WISDOM.</head>
<p>I will therefore set forth the method of all these things, that difficult and obscure subjects
may be more easily understood; and I will bring to light all these deceptions197 of the pretended
deity, led by which men have departed very far from the way of truth. But I will retrace
the matter far back from its source; that if any, unacquainted with the truth and ignorant,
shall apply himself to the reading of this book, he may be instructed, and may understand
what can in truth be “the source and origin of these evils;” and having received light, may
perceive his own errors and those of the whole human race.</p>
<p>Since God was possessed198 of the greatest foresight for planning, and of the greatest
skill for carrying out in action, before He commenced this business of the world,—inasmuch
as there was in Him, and always is, the fountain of full and most complete goodness,—in
order that goodness might spring as a stream from Him, and might flow forth afar, He
produced a Spirit like to Himself, who might be endowed with the perfections of God the
Father. But how He willed that, I will endeavour to show in the fourth book.199 Then He
made another being, in whom the disposition of the divine origin did not remain. Therefore
he was infected with his own envy as with poison, and passed from good to evil; and at his
own will, which had been given to him by God unfettered,200 he acquired for himself a
contrary name. From which it appears that the source of all evils is envy. For he envied his
predecessor,201 who through his stedfastness202 is acceptable and dear to God the Father.
This being, who from good became evil by his own act, is called by the Greeks diabolus:203
we call him accuser, because he reports to God the faults to which he himself entices us.
God, therefore, when He began the fabric of the world, set over the whole work that first
and greatest Son, and used Him at the same time as a counsellor and artificer, in planning,
arranging, and accomplishing, since He is complete both in knowledge,204 and judgment,
and power; concerning whom I now speak more sparingly, because in another place205 both

His excellence, and His name, and His nature must be related by us. Let no one inquire of
what materials God made these works so great and wonderful: for He made all things out
of nothing.</p>
<p>Nor are the poets to be listened to, who say that in the beginning was a chaos, that is, a
confusion of matter and the elements; but that God afterwards divided all that mass, and
having separated each object from the confused heap, and arranged them in order, He
constructed and adorned the world. Now it is easy to reply to these persons, who do not
understand the power of God: for they believe that He can produce nothing, except out of
materials already existing206 and prepared; in which error philosophers also were involved.
For Cicero, while discussing the nature of the gods,207 thus speaks: “First of all, therefore,
it is not probable208 that the matter209 from which all things arose was made by divine
providence, but that it has, and has had, a force and nature of its own. As therefore the
builder, when he is about to erect any building, does not himself make the materials, but
uses those which are already prepared, and the statuary210 also uses the wax; so that divine
providence ought to have had materials at hand, not of its own production, but already
prepared for use. But if matter was not made by God, then neither was the earth, and water,
and air, and fire, made by God.” Oh, how many faults there are in these ten lines! First, that
he who in almost all his other disputations and books was a maintainer of the divine
providence, and who used very acute arguments in assailing those who denied the existence
of a providence, now himself, as a traitor or deserter, endeavoured to take away providence;
in whose case, if you wish to oppose211 him, neither consideration nor labour is required:
it is only necessary to remind him of his own words. For it will be impossible for Cicero to
be more strongly refuted by any one than by Cicero himself. But let us make this concession
to the custom and practice of the Academics,212 that men are permitted to speak with great
freedom, and to entertain what sentiments they may wish. Let us examine the sentiments
themselves. It is not probable, he says, that matter was made by God. By what arguments
do you prove this? For you gave no reason for its being improbable. Therefore, on the contrary,
it appears to me exceedingly probable; nor does it appear so without reason, when I
reflect that there is something more in God, whom you verily reduce to the weakness of
man, to whom you allow nothing else but the mere workmanship. In what respect, then,

<pb n="110"/>
will that divine power differ from man, if God also, as man does, stands in need of the assistance
of another? But He does stand in need of it, if He can construct nothing unless He is
furnished with materials by another. But if this is the case, it is plain that His power is imperfect,
and he who prepared the material213 must be judged more powerful. By what name,
therefore, shall he be called who excels God in power?—since it is greater to make that which
is one’s own, than to arrange those things which are another’s. But if it is impossible that
anything should be more powerful than God, who must necessarily be of perfect strength,
power, and intelligence, it follows that He who made the things which are composed of
matter, made matter also. For it was neither possible nor befitting that anything should exist
without the exercise of God’s power, or against His will. But it is probable, he says, that
matter has, and always has had, a force and nature of its own.214 What force could it have,
without any one to give it? what nature, without any one to produce it? If it had force, it
took that force from some one. But from whom could it take it, unless it were from God?
Moreover, if it had a nature, which plainly is so called from being produced, it must have
been produced. But from whom could it have derived its existence, except God? For nature,
from which you say that all things had their origin, if it has no understanding, can make
nothing. But if it has the power of producing and making, then it has understanding, and
must be God. For that force can be called by no other name, in which there is both the
foresight215 to plan, and the skill and power to carry into effect. Therefore Seneca, the most
intelligent of all the Stoics, says better, who saw “that nature was nothing else but God.”
Therefore he says, “Shall we not praise God, who possesses natural excellence?” For He did
not learn it from any one. Yes, truly, we will praise Him; for although it is natural to Him,
He gave it to Himself,216 since God Himself is nature. When, therefore, you assign the origin
of all things to nature, and take it from God, you are in the same difficulty:—
<lg>
<l>“You pay your debt by borrowing,217 Geta.”</l>
</lg>
For while simply changing the name, you clearly admit that it was made by the same person
by whom you deny that it was made.</p>
<p>There follows a most senseless comparison. “As the builder,” he says, “when he is about
to erect any building, does not himself make the materials, but uses those which are already
prepared, and the statuary also the wax; so that divine providence ought to have had mater-

<pb n="111"/>
ials at hand, not of its own production, but already prepared for use.” Nay rather it ought
not; for God will have less power if He makes from materials already provided, which is the
part of man. The builder will erect nothing without wood, for he cannot make the wood itself;
and not to be able to do this is the part of human weakness. But God Himself makes the
materials for Himself, because He has the power. For to have the power is the property of
God; for if He is not able, He is not God. Man produces his works out of that which already
exists, because through his mortality he is weak, and through his weakness his power is
limited and moderate; but God produces His works out of that which has no existence, because
through His eternity He is strong, and through His strength His power is immense,
which has no end or limit, like the life of the Maker Himself. What wonder, then, if God,
when He was about to make the world, first prepared the material from which to make it,
and prepared it out of that which had no existence? Because it is impossible for God to
borrow anything from another source, inasmuch as all things are in Himself and from
Himself. For if there is anything before Him, and if anything has been made, but not by
Him, He will therefore lose both the power and the name of God. But it may be said matter
was never made, like God, who out of matter made this world. In that case, it follows that
two eternal principles are established, and those indeed opposed to one another, which
cannot happen without discord and destruction. For those things which have a contrary
force and method must of necessity come into collision. In this manner it will be impossible
that both should be eternal, if they are opposed to one another, because one must overpower
the other. Therefore the nature of that which is eternal cannot be otherwise than simple, so
that all things descended from that source as from a fountain. Therefore either God proceeded
from matter, or matter from God. Which of these is more true, is easily understood. For of
these two, one is endued with sensibility, the other is insensible. The power of making anything
cannot exist, except in that which has sensibility, intelligence, reflection, and the power
of motion. Nor can anything be begun, or made, or completed, unless it shall have been
foreseen by reason how it shall be made before it exists, and how it shall endure218 after it
has been made. In short, he only makes anything who has the will to make it, and hands to
complete that which he has willed. But that which is insensible always lies inactive and torpid;
nothing can originate in that source where there is no voluntary motion. For if every animal
is possessed of reason, it is certain that it cannot be produced from that which is destitute
of reason, nor can that which is not present in the original source219 be received from any
other quarter. Nor, however, let it disturb any one, that certain animals appear to be born
from the earth. For the earth does not give birth to these of itself, but the Spirit of God,
without which nothing is produced. Therefore God did not arise from matter, because a
<note type="footnote">218 Stand firm and stedfast.</note>
<note type="footnote">219 Which does not exist there, from whence it is sought.</note>

<pb n="112"/>
being endued with sensibility can never spring from one that is insensible, a wise one from
one that is irrational, one that is incapable of suffering from one that can suffer, an incorporeal
being from a corporeal one; but matter is rather from God. For whatever consists of
a body solid, and capable of being handled, admits of an external force. That which admits
of force is capable of dissolution; that which is dissolved perishes; that which perishes must
necessarily have had an origin; that which had an origin had a source220 from which it originated,
that is, some maker, who is intelligent, foreseeing, and skilled in making. There is
one assuredly, and that no other than God. And since He is possessed of sensibility, intelligence,
providence, power, and vigour, He is able to create and make both animated and
inanimate objects, because He has the means of making everything. But matter cannot always
have existed, for if it had existed it would be incapable of change. For that which always was,
does not cease always to be; and that which had no beginning must of necessity be without
an end. Moreover, it is easier for that which had a beginning to be without an end, than for
that which had no beginning, to have an end. Therefore if matter was not made, nothing
can be made from it. But if nothing can be made from it, then matter itself can have no existence.
For matter is that out of which something is made. But everything out of which
anything is made, inasmuch as it has received the hand of the artificer, is destroyed,221 and
begins to be some other thing. Therefore, since matter had an end, at the time when the
world was made out of it, it also had a beginning. For that which is destroyed222 was previously
built up; that which is loosened was previously bound up; that which is brought to an
end was begun. If, then, it is inferred from its change and end, that matter had a beginning,
from whom could that beginning have been, except from God? God, therefore, is the only
being who was not made; and therefore He can destroy other things, but He Himself cannot
be destroyed. That which was in Him will always be permanent, because He has not been
produced or sprung from any other source; nor does His birth depend on any other object,
which being changed may cause His dissolution. He is of Himself, as we said in the first
book;223 and therefore He is such as He willed that He should be, incapable of suffering,
unchangeable, incorruptible, blessed, and eternal.</p>
<p>But now the conclusion, with which Tully finished the sentiment, is much more absurd.
224 “But if matter,” he says, “was not made by God, the earth indeed, and water, and
air, and fire, were not made by God.” How skilfully he avoided the danger! For he stated
the former point as though it required no proof, whereas it was much more uncertain than

that on account of which the statement was made. If matter, he says, was not made by God,
the world was not made by God. He preferred to draw a false inference from that which is
false, than a true one from that which is true. And though uncertain things ought to be
proved from those which are certain, he drew a proof from an uncertainty, to overthrow
that which was certain. For, that the world was made by divine providence (not to mention
Trismegistus, who proclaims this; not to mention the verses of the Sibyls, who make the
same announcement; not to mention the prophets,225 who with one impulse and with harmonious226
voice bear witness that the world was made,227 and that it was the workmanship
of God), even the philosophers almost universally agree; for this is the opinion of the Pythagoreans,
the Stoics, and the Peripatetics, who are the chief of every sect.228 In short, from
those first seven wise men,229 even to Socrates and Plato, it was held as an acknowledged
and undoubted fact; until many ages afterwards230 the crazy Epicurus lived, who alone
ventured to deny that which is most evident, doubtless through the desire of discovering
novelties, that he might found a sect in his own name. And because he could find out
nothing new, that he might still appear to disagree with the others, he wished to overthrow
old opinions. But in this all the philosophers who snarled231 around him, refuted him. It is
more certain, therefore, that the world was arranged by providence, than that matter was
collected232 by providence. Wherefore he ought not to have supposed that the world was
not made by divine providence, because its matter was not made by divine providence; but
because the world was made by divine providence, he ought to have concluded that matter
also was made by the Deity. For it is more credible that matter was made by God, because
He is all-powerful, than that the world was not made by God, because nothing can be made
without mind, intelligence, and design. But this is not the fault of Cicero, but of the sect.

gods, respecting which philosophers prated, in his ignorance of the truth he imagined that
the Deity must altogether be taken away. He was able therefore to take away the gods, for
they had no existence. But when he attempted to overthrow the divine providence, which
is in the one God, because he had begun to strive against the truth, his arguments failed,
and he necessarily fell into this pitfall, from which he was unable to withdraw himself. Here,
then, I hold him firmly fixed; I hold him fastened to the spot, since Lucilius, who disputed
on the other side, was silent. Here, then, is the turning-point;233 on this everything depends.
Let Cotta disentangle himself, if he can, from this difficulty;234 let him bring forward arguments
by which he may prove that matter has always existed, which no providence made.
Let him show how anything ponderous and heavy either could exist without an author or
could be changed, and how that which always was ceased to be, so that that which never
was might begin to be. And if he shall prove these things, then, and not till then, will I admit
that the world itself was not established by divine providence, and yet in making this admission
I shall hold him fast by another snare. For he will turn round again to the same point,
to which he will be unwilling to return, so as to say that both the matter of which the world
consists, and the world which consists of matter, existed by nature; though I contend that
nature itself is God. For no one can make wonderful things, that is, things existing with the
greatest order, except one who has intelligence, foresight, and power. And thus it will come
to be seen that God made all things, and that nothing at all can exist which did not derive
its origin from God.</p>
<p>But the same, as often as he follows the Epicureans,235 and does not admit that the world
was made by God, is wont to inquire by what hands, by what machines, by what levers, by
what contrivance, He made this work of such magnitude. He might see, if he could have
lived at that time in which God made it. But, that man might not look into the works of
God, He was unwilling to bring him into this world until all things were completed. But he
could not be brought in: for how could he exist while the heaven above was being built, and
the foundations of the earth beneath were being laid; when humid things, perchance, either
benumbed with excessive stiffness were becoming congealed, or seethed with fiery heat and
rendered solid were growing hard? Or how could he live when the sun was not yet established,
and neither corn nor animals were produced? Therefore it was necessary that man should
be last made, when the finishing236 hand had now been applied to the world and to all
other things. Finally, the sacred writings teach that man was the last work of God, and that
he was brought into this world as into a house prepared and made ready; for all things were

made on his account. The poets also acknowledge the same. Ovid, having described the
completion of the world, and the formation of the other animals, added:237—
<lg>
<l>“An animal more sacred than these, and more capacious of a lofty mind, was yet
wanting, and which might exercise dominion over the rest. Man was
produced.”</l>
</lg>
So impious must we think it to search into those things which God wished to be kept secret!
But his inquiries were not made through a desire of hearing or learning, but of refuting; for
he was confident that no one could assert that. As though, in truth, it were to be supposed
that these things were not made by God, because it cannot be plainly seen in what manner
they were created! If you had been brought up in a well-built and ornamented house, and
had never seen a workshop,238 would you have supposed that that house was not built by
man, because you did not know how it was built? You would assuredly ask the same question
about the house which you now ask about the world—by what hands, with what implements,
man had contrived such great works; and especially if you should see large stones, immense
blocks,239 vast columns, the whole work lofty and elevated, would not these things appear
to you to exceed the measure of human strength, because you would not know that these
things were made not so much by strength as by skill and ingenuity?</p>
<p>But if man, in whom nothing is perfect, nevertheless effects more by skill than his feeble
strength would permit, what reason is there why it should appear to you incredible, when
it is alleged that the world was made by God, in whom, since He is perfect, wisdom can have
no limit, and strength no measure? His works are seen by the eyes; but how He made them
is not seen even by the mind, because, as Hermes says, the mortal cannot draw nigh to (that
is, approach nearer, and follow up with the understanding) the immortal, the temporal240
to the eternal, the corruptible to the incorruptible. And on this account the earthly animal
is as yet incapable of perceiving241 heavenly things, because it is shut in and held as it were
in custody by the body, so that it cannot discern all things with free and unrestrained perception.
Let him know, therefore, how foolishly he acts, who inquires into things which are
indescribable. For this is to pass the limits of one’s own condition, and not to understand
how far it is permitted man to approach. In short, when God revealed the truth to man, He
wished us only to know those things which it concerned man to know for the attainment

of life; but as to the things which related to a profane and eager curiosity242 He was silent,
that they might be secret. Why, then, do you inquire into things which you cannot know,
and if you knew them you would not be happier. It is perfect wisdom in man, if he knows
that there is but one God, and that all things were made by Him.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF THE WORLD, AND ITS PARTS, THE ELEMENTS AND SEASONS.</head>
<p>Now, having refuted those who entertain false sentiments respecting the world and God
its Maker, let us return to the divine workmanship of the world, concerning which we are
informed in the sacred243 writings of our holy religion. Therefore, first of all, God made the
heaven, and suspended it on high, that it might be the seat of God Himself, the Creator.
Then He founded the earth, and placed it under the heaven, as a dwelling-place for man,
with the other races of animals. He willed that it should be surrounded and held together
by water. But He adorned and filled His own dwelling-place with bright lights; He decked
it with the sun, and the shining orb of the moon, and with the glittering signs of the twinkling
stars; but He placed on the earth the darkness, which is contrary to these. For of itself the
earth contains no light, unless it receives it from the heaven, in which He placed perpetual
light, and the gods above, and eternal life; and, on the contrary, He placed on the earth
darkness, and the inhabitants of the lower regions, and death. For these things are as far
removed from the former ones, as evil things are from good, and vices from virtues. He also
established two parts of the earth itself opposite to one another, and of a different character,—
namely, the east and the west; and of these the east is assigned to God, because He
Himself is the fountain of light, and the enlightener244 of all things, and because He makes
us rise to eternal life. But the west is ascribed to that disturbed and depraved mind, because
it conceals the light, because it always brings on darkness, and because it makes men die
and perish in their sins. For as light belongs to the east, and the whole course of life depends
upon the light, so darkness belongs to the west: but death and destruction are contained in
darkness.245 Then He measured out in the same way the other parts,—namely, the south
and the north, which parts are closely united with the two former. For that which is more
glowing with the warmth of the sun, is nearest to and closely united with the east; but that
which is torpid with colds and perpetual ice belongs to the same division as the extreme
west. For as darkness is opposed to light, so is cold to heat. As, therefore, heat is nearest to
light, so is the south to the east; and as cold is nearest to darkness, so is the northern region
to the west. And He assigned to each of these parts its own time,—namely, the spring to the
east, the summer to the southern region, the autumn belongs to the west, and the winter to
the north. In these two parts also, the southern and the northern, is contained a figure of
life and death, because life consists in heat, death in cold. And as heat arises from fire, so

does cold from water. And according to the division of these parts He also made day and
night, to complete by alternate succession with each other the courses246 and perpetual revolutions
of time, which we call years. The day, which the first east supplies, must belong
to God, as all things do, which are of a better character. But the night, which the extreme
west brings on, belongs, indeed, to him whom we have said to be the rival of God.</p>
<p>And even in the making of these God had regard to the future; for He made them so,
that a representation of true religion and of false superstitions might be shown from these.
For as the sun, which rises daily, although it is but one,—from which Cicero would have it
appear that it was called Sol,247 because the stars are obscured, and it alone is seen,—yet,
since it is a true light, and of perfect fulness, and of most powerful heat, and enlightens all
things with the brightest splendour; so God, although He is one only, is possessed of perfect
majesty, and might, and splendour. But night, which we say is assigned to that depraved
adversary of God,248 shows by a resemblance the many and various superstitions which
belong to him. For although innumerable stars appear to glitter and shine,249 yet, because
they are not full and solid lights, and send forth no heat, nor overpower the darkness by
their multitude, therefore these two things are found to be of chief importance, which have
power differing from and opposed to one another—heat and moisture, which God wonderfully
designed for the support and production of all things. For since the power of God
consists in heat and fire, if He had not tempered its ardour and force by mingling matter of
moisture and cold, nothing could have been born or have existed, but whatever had begun
to exist must immediately have been destroyed by conflagration. From which also some
philosophers and poets said that the world was made up of a discordant concord; but they
did not thoroughly understand the matter. Heraclitus said that all things were produced
from fire; Thales of Miletus from water. Each saw something of the truth, and yet each was
in error: for if one element only had existed, water could not have been produced from fire,
nor, on the other hand, could fire from water; but it is more true that all things were produced
from a mingling of the two. Fire, indeed, cannot be mixed with water, because they are opposed
to each other; and if they came into collision, the one which proved superior must
destroy the other. But their substances may be mingled. The substance of fire is heat; of
water, moisture. Rightly therefore does Ovid say:250—

<note type="footnote">247 A play upon the words Sol, the sun, and solus, alone.</note>

<pb n="119"/>
<lg>
<l>“For when moisture and heat have become mingled, they conceive, and all things
arise from these two. And though fire is at variance with water, moist
vapour produces all things, and discordant concord251 is adapted to
production.”</l>
</lg>
For the one element is, as it were, masculine; the other, as it were, feminine: the one active,
the other passive. And on this account it was appointed by the ancients that marriage contracts
should be ratified by the solemnity252 of fire and water, because the young of animals
are furnished with a body by heat and moisture, and are thus animated to life.</p>
<p>For, since every animal consists of soul253 and body, the material of the body is contained
in moisture, that of the soul in heat: which we may know from the offspring of birds; for
though these are full of thick moisture, unless they are cherished by creative254 heat, the
moisture cannot become a body, nor can the body be animated with life. Exiles also were
accustomed to be forbidden the use of fire and water: for as yet it seemed unlawful to inflict
capital punishment on any, however guilty, inasmuch as they were men. When, therefore,
the use of those things in which the life of men consists was forbidden, it was deemed to be
equivalent to the actual infliction of death on him who had been thus sentenced. Of such
importance were these two elements considered, that they believed them to be essential for
the production of man, and for the sustaining of his life. One of these is common to us with
the other animals, the other has been assigned to man alone. For we, being a heavenly and
immortal race,255 make use of fire, which is given to us as a proof of immortality, since fire
is from heaven; and its nature, inasmuch as it is moveable and rises upward, contains the
principle of life. But the other animals, inasmuch as they are altogether mortal, make use
of water only, which is a corporeal and earthly element. And the nature of this, because it
is moveable, and has a downward inclination, shows a figure of death. Therefore the cattle
do not look up to heaven, nor do they entertain religious sentiments, since the use of fire is
removed from them. But from what source or in what manner God lighted up or caused256
to flow these two principal elements, fire and water, He who made them alone can know.257</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF LIVING CREATURES, OF MAN; PROMETHEUS, DEUCALION, THE
PARCÆ.</head>
<p>Therefore, having finished the world, He commanded that animals of various kinds
and of dissimilar forms should be created, both great and smaller. And they were made in
pairs, that is, one of each sex; from the offspring of which both the air and the earth and the
seas were filled. And God gave nourishment to all these by their kinds258 from the earth,
that they might be of service to men: some, for instance, were for food, others for clothing;
but those which are of great strength He gave, that they might assist in cultivating the earth,
whence they were called beasts of burthen.259 And thus, when all things had been settled
with a wonderful arrangement, He determined to prepare for Himself an eternal kingdom,
and to create innumerable souls, on whom He might bestow immortality. Then He made
for Himself a figure endowed with perception and intelligence, that is, after the likeness of
His own image, than which nothing can be more perfect: He formed man out of the dust
of the ground, from which he was called man,260 because He was made from the earth. Finally,
Plato says that the human form261 was godlike; as does the Sibyl, who says,—
<lg>
<l>“Thou art my image, O man, possessed of right reason.”262</l>
</lg>
The poets also have not given a different account respecting this formation of man, however
they may have corrupted it; for they said that man was made by Prometheus from clay. They
were not mistaken in the matter itself, but in the name of the artificer. For they had never
come into contact with a line of the truth; but the things which were handed down by the
oracles of the prophets, and contained in the sacred book263 of God; those things collected
from fables and obscure opinion, and distorted, as the truth is wont to be corrupted by the
multitude when spread abroad by various conversations, everyone adding something to
that which he had heard,— those things they comprised in their poems; and in this, indeed,
they acted foolishly, in that they attributed so wonderful and divine a work to man. For what
need was there that man should be formed of clay, when he might be generated in the same
way in which Prometheus himself was born from Iapetus? For if he was a man, he was able

to beget a man, but not to make one. But his punishment on Mount Caucasus declares that
he was not of the gods. But no one reckoned his father Iapetus or his uncle264 Titan as gods,
because the high dignity of the kingdom was in possession of Saturn only, by which he obtained
divine honours, together with all his descendants. This invention of the poets admits
of refutation by many arguments. It is agreed by all that the deluge took place for the destruction
of wickedness, and for its removal from the earth. Now, both philosophers and poets,
and writers of ancient history, assert the same, and in this they especially agree with the
language of the prophets. If, therefore, the flood took place for the purpose of destroying
wickedness, which had increased through the excessive multitude of men, how was
Prometheus the maker of man, when his son Deucalion is said by the same writers to have
been the only one who was preserved on account of his righteousness? How could a single
descent265 and a single generation have so quickly filled the world with men? But it is plain
that they have corrupted this also, as they did the former account; since they were ignorant
both at what time the flood happened on the earth, and who it was that deserved on account
of his righteousness to be saved when the human race perished, and how and with whom
he was saved: all of which are taught by the inspired266 writings. It is plain, therefore, that
the account which they give respecting the work of Prometheus is false.</p>
<p>But because I had said267 that the poets are not accustomed to speak that which is altogether
untrue, but to wrap up in figures and thus to obscure their accounts, I do not say
that they spoke falsely in this, but that first of all Prometheus made the image of a man of
rich and soft clay, and that he first originated the art of making statues and images; inasmuch
as he lived in the times of Jupiter, during which temples began to be built, and new modes
of worshipping the gods introduced. And thus the truth was corrupted by falsehood; and
that which was said to have been made by God began also to be ascribed to man, who imitated
the divine work. But the making of the true and living man from clay is the work of God.
And this also is related by Hermes,268 who not only says that man was made by God, after
the image of God, but he even tried to explain in how skilful a manner He formed each limb
in the human body, since there is none of them which is not as available for the necessity
of use as for beauty. But even the Stoics, when they discuss the subject of providence, attempt
to do this; and Tully followed them in many places. But, however, he briefly treats of a
subject so copious and fruitful, which I now pass over on this account, because I have lately
written a particular book on this subject to my disciple Demetrianus. But I cannot here omit

that which some erring philosophers say, that men and the other animals arose from the
earth without any author; whence that expression of Virgil:269—
<lg>
<l>“And the earth-born270 race of men raised its head from the hard fields.”</l>
</lg>
And this opinion is especially entertained by those who deny the existence of a divine
providence. For the Stoics attribute the formation of animals to divine skill. But Aristotle
freed himself from labour and trouble, by saying that the world always existed, and therefore
that the human race, and the other things which are in it, had no beginning, but always had
been, and always would be. But when we see that each animal separately, which had no
previous existence, begins to exist, and ceases to exist, it is necessary that the whole race
must at some time have begun to exist, and must cease at some time because it had a beginning.</p>
<p>For all things must necessarily be comprised in three periods of time—the past, the
present, and the future. The commencement271 belongs to the past, existence to the present,
dissolution to the future. And all these things are seen in the case of men individually: for
we begin when we are born; and we exist while we live; and we cease when we die. On which
account they would have it that there are three Parcæ:272 one who warps the web of life for
men; the second, who weaves it; the third, who cuts and finishes it. But in the whole race of
men, because the present time only is seen, yet from it the past also, that is, the commencement,
and the future, that is, the dissolution, are inferred
For since it exists, it is evident
that at some time it began to exist, for nothing can exist without a beginning; and because
it had a beginning, it is evident that it will at some time have an end. For that cannot, as a
whole, be immortal, which consists of mortals. For as we all die individually, it is possible
that, by some calamity, all may perish simultaneously: either through the unproductiveness
of the earth, which sometimes happens in particular cases; or through the general spread
of pestilence, which often desolates separate cities and countries; or by the conflagration of
the world, as is said to have happened in the case of Phaethon; or by a deluge, as is reported
in the time of Deucalion, when the whole race was destroyed with the exception of one man.
And if this deluge happened by chance, it might assuredly have happened that he who was
the only survivor should perish. But if he was reserved by the will of divine providence, as
it cannot be denied, to recruit mankind, it is evident that the life and the destruction of the
human race are in the power of God. And if it is possible for it to die altogether, because it

dies in parts, it is evident that it had an origin at some time; and as the liability to decay273
bespeaks a beginning, so also it gives proof of an end. And if these things are true, Aristotle
will be unable to maintain that the world also itself had no beginning. But if Plato and
Epicurus extort this from Aristotle, yet Plato and Aristotle, who thought that the world
would be everlasting, will, notwithstanding their eloquence, be deprived of this also by
Epicurus, because it follows, that, as it had a beginning, it must also have an end. But we
will speak of these things at greater length in the last book. Now let us revert to the origin
of man.</p>

<head>CHAP. XII.—THAT ANIMALS WERE NOT PRODUCED SPONTANEOUSLY, BUT
BY A DIVINE ARRANGEMENT, OF WHICH GOD WOULD HAVE GIVEN US THE
KNOWLEDGE, IF IT WERE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US TO KNOW IT.</head>
<p>They say that at certain changes of the heaven, and motions of the stars, there existed
a kind of maturity274 for the production of animals; and thus that the new earth, retaining
the productive seed, brought forth of itself certain vessels275 after the likeness of wombs,
respecting which Lucretius276 says,—
<lg>
<l>“Wombs grew attached to the earth by roots;”</l>
</lg>
and that these, when they had become mature, being rent by the compulsion of nature,
produced tender animals; afterwards, that the earth itself abounded with a kind of moisture
which resembled milk, and that animals were supported by this nourishment. How, then,
were they able to endure or avoid the force of the cold or of heat, or to be born at all, since
the sun would scorch them or the cold contract them? But, they say, at the beginning of the
world there was no winter nor summer, but a perpetual spring of an equable temperature.277
Why, then, do we see that none of these things now happens? Because, they say, it was necessary
that it should once happen, that animals might be born; but after they began to exist,
and the power of generation was given to them, the earth ceased to bring forth, and the
condition of time278 was changed. Oh, how easy it is to refute falsehoods! In the first place,
nothing can exist in this world which does not continue permanent, as it began. For neither
were the sun and moon and stars then uncreated; nor, having been created, were they without
their motions; nor did that divine government, which manages and rules their courses, fail
to begin its exercise together with them. In the next place, if it is as they say, there must of
necessity be a providence, and they fall into that very condition which they especially avoid.
For while the animals were yet unborn, it is plain that some one provided that they should
be born, that the world might not appear gloomy279 with waste and desolation. But, that
they might be produced from the earth without the office of parents, provision must have
been made with great judgment; and in the next place, that the moisture condensed from
the earth might be formed into the various figures of bodies; and also that, having received
from the vessels with which they were covered the power of life and sensation, they might

be poured forth, as it were, from the womb of mothers, is a wonderful and indescribable280
provision. But let us suppose that this also happened by chance; the circumstances which
follow assuredly cannot be by chance,—that the earth should at once flow with milk, and
that the temperature of the atmosphere should be equable. And if these things plainly
happened, that the newly born animals might have nourishment, or be free from danger, it
must be that some one provided these things by some divine counsel.</p>
<p>But who is able to make this provision except God? Let us, however, see whether the
circumstance itself which they assert could have taken place, that men should be born from
the earth. If any one considers during how long a time and in what manner an infant is
reared, he will assuredly understand that those earth-born children could not possibly have
been reared without some one to bring them up. For they must have lain for many months
cast forth, until their sinews were strengthened, so that they had power to move themselves
and to change their place, which can scarcely happen within the space of one year. Now see
whether an infant could have lain through many months in the same manner and in the
same place where it was cast forth, without dying, overwhelmed and corrupted by that
moisture of the earth which it supplied for the sake of nourishment, and by the excrements
of its own body mixed together. Therefore it is impossible but that it was reared by some
one; unless, indeed, all animals are born not in a tender condition, but grown up: and it
never came into their mind to say this. Therefore the whole of that method is impossible
and vain; if that can be called method by which it is attempted that there shall be no method.
For he who says that all things are produced of their own accord, and attributes nothing to
divine providence, he assuredly does not assert, but overthrows method. But if nothing can
be done or produced without design, it is plain that there is a divine providence, to which
that which is called design peculiarly belongs. Therefore God, the Contriver of all things,
made man. And even Cicero, though ignorant of the sacred writings, saw this, who in his
treatise on the Laws, in the first book,281 handed down the same thing as the prophets; and
I add his words: “This animal, foreseeing, sagacious, various, acute, gifted with memory,
full of method and design, which we call man, was produced by the supreme Deity under
remarkable circumstances; for this alone of so many kinds and natures of animals, partakes
of judgment and reflection, when all other animals are destitute of them.” Do you see that
the man, although far removed from the knowledge of the truth, yet, inasmuch as he held
the image of wisdom, understood that man could not be produced except by God? But,
however, there is need of divine282 testimony, lest that of man should be insufficient. The
Sibyl testifies that man is the work of God:—

The sacred writings contain statements to the same effect. Therefore God discharged the
office of a true father. He Himself formed the body; He Himself infused the soul with which
we breathe. Whatever we are, it is altogether His work. In what manner He effected this He
would have taught us, if it were right for us to know; as He taught us other things, which

<head>CHAP. XIII.—WHY MAN IS OF TWO SEXES; WHAT IS HIS FIRST DEATH, AND
WHAT THE SECOND AND OF THE FAULT AND PUNISHMENT OF OUR FIRST
PARENTS.</head>
<p>When, therefore, He had first formed the male after His own likeness, then He also
fashioned woman after the image of the man himself, that the two by their union might be
able to perpetuate their race, and to fill the whole earth with a multitude. But in the making
of man himself He concluded and completed the nature of those two materials which we
have spoken of as contrary to each other, fire and water. For having made the body, He
breathed into it a soul from the vital source of His own Spirit, which is everlasting, that it
might bear the similitude of the world itself, which is composed of opposing elements. For
he284 consists of soul and body, that is, as it were, of heaven and earth: since the soul by
which we live, has its origin, as it were, out of heaven from God, the body out of the earth,
of the dust of which we have said that it was formed. Empedocles—whom you cannot tell
whether to reckon among poets or philosophers, for he wrote in verse respecting the nature
of things, as did Lucretius and Varro among the Romans—determined that there were four
elements, that is, fire, air, water, and earth; perhaps following Trismegistus, who said that
our bodies were composed of these four elements by God, for he said that they contained
in themselves something of fire, something of air, something of water, and something of
earth, and yet that they were neither fire, nor air, nor water, nor earth. And these things indeed
are not false; for the nature of earth is contained in the flesh, that of moisture in the
blood, that of air in the breath, that of fire in the vital heat. But neither can the blood be
separated from the body, as moisture is from the earth; nor the vital heat from the breath,
as fire from the air: so that of all things only two elements are found, the whole nature of
which is included in the formation of our body. Man, therefore, was made from different
and opposite substances, as the world itself was made from light and darkness, from life and
death; and he has admonished us that these two things contend against each other in man:
so that if the soul, which has its origin from God, gains the mastery, it is immortal, and lives
in perpetual light; if, on the other hand, the body shall overpower the soul, and subject it to
its dominion, it is in everlasting darkness and death.285 And the force of this is not that it
<note type="footnote">284 i.e., man.</note>
<note type="footnote">285 It was necessary to remove ambiguity from the heathen, to whom the word death conveys no such
meaning. In the sacred writings the departure of the soul from the body is often spoken of as sleep, or rest. Thus
Lazarus is said to sleep. 1 Thess. iv. 14, “Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him,”—an expression of
great beauty and propriety as applied to Christians. On the other hand, the prophets speak of “the shadow of
death.”</note>

altogether annihilates286 the souls of the unrighteous, but subjects them to everlasting
punishment.287</p>
<p>We term that punishment the second death, which is itself also perpetual, as also is
immortality. We thus define the first death: Death is the dissolution of the nature of living
beings; or thus: Death is the separation of body and soul. But we thus define the second
death: Death is the suffering of eternal pain; or thus: Death is the condemnation of souls
for their deserts to eternal punishments. This does not extend to the dumb cattle, whose
spirits, not being composed of God,288 but of the common air, are dissolved by death.
Therefore in this union of heaven and earth, the image of which is developed289 in man,
those things which belong to God occupy the higher part, namely the soul, which has
dominion over the body; but those which belong to the devil occupy the lower290 part,
manifestly the body: for this, being earthly, ought to be subject to the soul, as the earth is to
heaven. For it is, as it were, a vessel which this heavenly spirit may employ as a temporary
dwelling. The duties of both are—for the latter, which is from heaven and from God, to
command; but for the former, which is from the earth and the devil, to obey. And this, indeed,
did not escape the notice of a dissolute man, Sallust,291 who says: “But all our power consists
in the soul and body; we use the soul to command, the body rather to obey.” It had been
well if he had lived in accordance with his words; for he was a slave to the most degrading
pleasures, and he destroyed the efficacy of his sentiment by the depravity of his life. But if
the soul is fire, as we have shown, it ought to mount up to heaven as fire, that it may not be
extinguished; that is, it ought to rise to the immortality which is in heaven. And as fire cannot
burn and be kept alive unless it be nourished292 by some rich fuel293 in which it may have
sustenance, so the fuel and food of the soul is righteousness alone, by which it is nourished
unto life. After these things, God, having made man in the manner in which I have pointed
out, placed him in paradise,294 that is, in a most fruitful and pleasant garden, which He
<note type="footnote">286 Extinguishes. Compare the words of Christ Himself, John v. 29; Acts xxiv. 15.</note>

by their various fruits; and being free from all labours,295 might devote himself entirely
to the service of God his Father.</p>
<p>Then He gave to him fixed commands, by the observance of which he might continue
immortal; or if he transgressed them, be punished with death. It was enjoined that he should
not taste of one tree only which was in the midst of the garden,296 in which He had placed
the knowledge of good and evil. Then the accuser, envying the works of God, applied all his
deceits and artifices to beguile297 the man, that he might deprive him of immortality. And
first he enticed the woman by fraud to take the forbidden fruit, and through her instrumentality
he also persuaded the man himself to transgress the law of God. Therefore, having
obtained the knowledge of good and evil, he began to be ashamed of his nakedness, and hid
himself from the face of God, which he was not before accustomed to do. Then God drove
out the man from the garden, having passed sentence upon the sinner, that he might seek
support for himself by labour. And He surrounded298 the garden itself with fire, to prevent
the approach of the man until He execute the last judgment on earth; and having removed
death, recall righteous men, His worshippers, to the same place; as the sacred writers teach,
and the Erythræan Sibyl, when she says: “But they who honour the true God inherit everlasting
life, themselves inhabiting together paradise, the beautiful garden, for ever.” But
since these are the last things,299 we will treat of them in the last part of this work. Now let
us explain those which are first. Death therefore followed man, according to the sentence
of God, which even the Sibyl teaches in her verse, saying: “Man made by the very hands of
God, whom the serpent treacherously beguiled that he might come to the fate of death, and
receive the knowledge of good and evil.” Thus the life of man became limited in duration;300
but still, however, long, inasmuch as it was extended to a thousand301 years. And when
Varro was not ignorant of this, handed down as it is in the sacred writings, and spread
<note type="footnote">295 We are not to understand this as asserting that the man lived in idleness, and without any employment
in paradise; for this would be inconsistent with the Scripture narrative, which tells us that Adam was placed

of sin. See Gen. iii. 17.</note>

to have lived a thousand years. For he says that among the Egyptians months are accounted302
as years: so that the circuit of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac does
not make a year, but the moon, which traverses that sign-bearing circle in the space of thirty
days; which argument is manifestly false. For no one then exceeded the thousandth year.
But now they who attain to the hundredth year, which frequently happens, undoubtedly
live a thousand and two hundred months. And competent303 authorities report that men
are accustomed to reach one hundred and twenty years.304 But because Varro did not know
why or when the life of man was shortened, he himself shortened it, since he knew that it
was possible for man to live a thousand and four hundred months.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIV.—OF NOAH THE INVENTOR OF WINE, WHO FIRST HAD
KNOWLEDGE OF THE STARS, AND OF THE ORIGIN OF FALSE RELIGIONS.</head>
<p>But afterwards God, when He saw the earth filled with wickedness and crimes, determined
to destroy mankind with a deluge; but, however, for renewing the multitude, He chose
one man, who,305 when all were corrupted, stood forth pre-eminent, as a remarkable example
of righteousness. He, when six hundred years old, built an ark, as God had commanded
him, in which he himself was saved, together with his wife and three sons, and as many
daughters-in-law, when the water had covered all the loftiest mountains. Then when the
earth was dry, God, execrating the wickedness of the former age, that the length of life might
not again be a cause of meditating evils, gradually diminished the age of man by each successive
generation, and placed a limit at a hundred and twenty years,306 which it might not
be permitted to exceed. But he, when he went forth from the ark, as the sacred writings inform
us, diligently cultivated the earth, and planted a vineyard with his own hand. From which
circumstance they are refuted who regard Bacchus as the author of wine. For he not only
preceded Bacchus, but also Saturn and Uranus, by many generations. And when he had
first taken the fruit from the vineyard, having become merry, he drank even to intoxication,
and lay naked. And when one of his sons, whose name was Cham,307 had seen this, he did
not cover his father’s nakedness, but went out and told the circumstance to his brothers
also. But they, having taken a garment, entered with their faces turned backwards, and
covered their father.308 And when their father became aware of what had been done he
disowned and sent away his son. But he went into exile, and settled in a part of that land
which is now called Arabia; and that land was called from him Chanaan, and his posterity
Chanaanites. This was the first nation which was ignorant of God, since its prince and

founder did not receive from his father the worship of God, being cursed by him;309 and
thus he left to his descendants ignorance of the divine nature.310</p>
<p>From this nation all the nearest people flowed as the multitude increased. But the descendants
of his father were called Hebrews, among whom the religion of the true God was
established.311 But from these also in after times, when their number was multiplied exceedingly,
since the small extent of their settlements could not contain them, then young men,
either sent by their parents or of their own accord, by the compulsion of poverty, leaving
their own lands to seek for themselves new settlements, were scattered in all directions, and
filled all the islands and the whole earth; and thus being torn away from the stem of their
sacred root, they established for themselves at their own discretion new customs and institutions.
But they who occupied Egypt were the first of all who began to look up to and adore
the heavenly bodies. And because they did not shelter themselves in houses on account of
the quality of the atmosphere, and the heaven is not overspread with any clouds in that
country, they observed the courses of the stars, and their obscurations,312 while in their
frequent adorations they more carefully and freely beheld them. Then afterwards, induced
by certain prodigies, they invented monstrous figures of animals, that they might worship
them; the authors of which we will presently disclose. But the others, who were scattered
over the earth, admiring the elements of the world, began to worship the heaven, the sun,
the earth, the sea, without any images and temples, and offered sacrifices to them in the
open air, until in process of time they erected temples and statues to the most powerful
kings, and originated the practice of honouring them with victims and odours; and thus
wandering from the knowledge of God, they began to be heathens. They err, therefore, who
contend that the worship of the gods was from the beginning of the world, and that heathenism

<head>CHAP. XV.—OF THE CORRUPTION OF ANGELS, AND THE TWO KINDS OF
DEMONS.</head>
<p>When, therefore, the number of men had begun to increase, God in His forethought,
lest the devil, to whom from the beginning He had given power over the earth, should by
his subtilty either corrupt or destroy men, as he had done at first, sent angels for the protection
and improvement313 of the human race; and inasmuch as He had given these a free
will, He enjoined them above all things not to defile themselves with contamination from
the earth, and thus lose the dignity of their heavenly nature.314 He plainly prohibited them
from doing that which He knew that they would do, that they might entertain no hope of
pardon. Therefore, while they abode among men, that most deceitful ruler315 of the earth,
by his very association, gradually enticed them to vices, and polluted them by intercourse
with women. Then, not being admitted into heaven on account of the sins into which they
had plunged themselves, they fell to the earth. Thus from angels the devil makes them to
become his satellites and attendants. But they who were born from these, because they were
neither angels nor men, but bearing a kind of mixed316 nature, were not admitted into hell,
as their fathers were not into heaven. Thus there came to be two kinds of demons; one of
heaven, the other of the earth. The latter are the wicked317 spirits, the authors of all the evils
which are done, and the same devil is their prince. Whence Trismegistus calls him the ruler
of the demons. But grammarians say that they are called demons, as though doemones,318
that is, skilled and acquainted with matters: for they think that these are gods. They are acquainted,
indeed, with many future events, but not all, since it is not permitted them entirely
to know the counsel of God; and therefore they are accustomed to accommodate319 their
answers to ambiguous results. The poets both know them to be demons, and so describe
them. Hesiod thus speaks:—
<lg>
<l>“These are the demons according to the will of Zeus, Good, living on the earth,
the guardians of mortal men.”</l>

great honours, after their death became demons, in accordance with this title of prudence and wisdom. [See the

And this is said for this purpose, because God had sent them as guardians to the human
race; but they themselves also, though they are the destroyers of men, yet wish themselves
to appear as their guardians, that they themselves may be worshipped, and God may not be
worshipped. The philosophers also discuss the subject of these beings. For Plato attempted
even to explain their natures in his “Banquet;” and Socrates said that there was a demon
continually about him, who had become attached to him when a boy, by whose will and
direction his life was guided. The art also and power of the Magi altogether consists in the
influences320 of these; invoked by whom they deceive the sight of men with deceptive illusions,
321 so that they do not see those things which exist, and think that they see those things
which do not exist. These contaminated and abandoned spirits, as I say, wander over the
whole earth, and contrive a solace for their own perdition by the destruction of men.
Therefore they fill every place with snares, deceits, frauds, and errors; for they cling to individuals,
and occupy whole houses from door to door, and assume to themselves the name
of genii; for by this word they translate demons in the Latin language. They consecrate these
in their houses, to these they daily pour out322 libations of wine, and worship the wise
demons as gods of the earth, and as averters of those evils which they themselves cause and
impose. And these, since spirits are without substance323 and not to be grasped, insinuate
themselves into the bodies of men; and secretly working in their inward parts, they corrupt
the health, hasten diseases, terrify their souls with dreams, harass their minds with phrenzies,
that by these evils they may compel men to have recourse to their aid.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—THAT DEMONS HAVE NO POWER OVER THOSE WHO ARE
ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH.</head>
<p>And the nature of all these deceits324 is obscure to those who are without the truth. For
they think that those demons profit them when they cease to injure, whereas they have no
power except to injure.325 Some one may perchance say that they are therefore to be worshipped,
that they may not injure, since they have the power to injure. They do indeed injure,
but those only by whom they are feared, whom the powerful and lofty hand of God does
not protect, who are uninitiated in the mystery326 of truth. But they fear the righteous,327
that is, the worshippers of God, adjured by whose name they depart328 from the bodies of
the possessed: for, being lashed by their words as though by scourges, they not only confess
themselves to be demons, but even utter their own names—those which are adored in the
temples—which they generally do in the presence of their own worshippers; not, it is plain,
to the disgrace of religion, but329 to the disgrace of their own honour, because they cannot
speak falsely to God, by whom they are adjured, nor to the righteous, by whose voice they
are tortured. Therefore ofttimes having uttered the greatest howlings, they cry out that they
are beaten, and are on fire, and that they are just on the point of coming forth: so much
power has the knowledge of God, and righteousness! Whom, therefore, can they injure,
except those whom they have in their own power? In short, Hermes affirms that those who
have known God are not only safe from the attacks of demons, but that they are not even
bound by fate. “The only protection,” he says, “is piety, for over a pious man neither evil
demon nor fate has any power: for God rescues the pious man from all evil; for the one and
only good thing among men is piety.” And what piety is, he testifies in another place, in
these words: “For piety is the knowledge of God.” Asclepius also, his disciple, more fully
expressed the same sentiment in that finished discourse which he wrote to the king. Each
of them, in truth, affirms that the demons are the enemies and harassers of men, and on
this account Trismegistus calls them wicked angels; so far was he from being ignorant that
from heavenly beings they were corrupted, and began to be earthly.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.—THAT ASTROLOGY, SOOTHSAYING, AND SIMILAR ARTS ARE
THE INVENTION OF DEMONS.</head>
<p>These were the inventors of astrology, and soothsaying, and divination, and those productions
which are called oracles, and necromancy, and the art of magic, and whatever evil
practices besides these men exercise, either openly or in secret. Now all these things are false
of themselves, as the Erythræan Sibyl testifies:—
<lg>
<l>“Since all these things are erroneous,</l>
<l>Which foolish men search after day by day.”</l>
</lg>
But these same authorities by their countenance330 cause it to be believed that they are true.
Thus they delude the credulity of men by lying divination, because it is not expedient for
them to lay open the truth. These are they who taught men to make images and statues;
who, in order that they might turn away the minds of men from the worship of the true
God, cause the countenances of dead kings, fashioned and adorned with exquisite beauty,
to be erected and consecrated, and assumed to themselves their names, as though they were
assuming some characters. But the magicians, and those whom the people truly call enchanters,
331 when they practice their detestable arts, call upon them by their true names,
those heavenly names which are read in the sacred writings. Moreover, these impure and
wandering spirits, that they may throw all things into confusion, and overspread the minds
of men with errors, interweave and mingle false things with true. For they themselves feigned
that there are many heavenly beings, and one king of all, Jupiter; because there are many
spirits of angels in heaven, and one Parent and Lord of all, God. But they have concealed
the truth under false names, and withdrawn it from sight.</p>
<p>For God, as I have shown in the beginning,332 does not need a name, since He is alone;
nor do the angels, inasmuch as they are immortal, either suffer or wish themselves to be
called gods: for their one and only duty is to submit to the will of God, and not to do anything
at all except at His command. For we say that the world is so governed by God, as a province
is by its ruler; and no one would say that his attendants333 are his sharers in the administration
of the province, although business is carried on by their service. And yet these can effect
something contrary to the commands of the ruler, through his ignorance; which is the result
of man’s condition. But that guardian of the world and ruler of the universe, who knows all
things, from whose divine eyes nothing is concealed,334 has alone with His Son the power

over all things; nor is there anything in the angels except the necessity of obedience. Therefore
they wish no honour to be paid to them, since all their honour is in God. But they who have
revolted from the service of God, because they are enemies of the truth, and betrayers335 of
God attempt to claim for themselves the name and worship of gods; not that they desire
any honour (for what honour is there to the lost?), nor that they may injure God, who cannot
be injured, but that they may injure men, whom they strive to turn away from the worship
and knowledge of the true Majesty, that they may not be able to obtain immortality, which
they themselves have lost through their wickedness. Therefore they draw on darkness, and
overspread the truth with obscurity, that men may not know their Lord and Father. And
that they may easily entice them, they conceal themselves in the temples, and are close at
hand at all sacrifices; and they often give prodigies, that men, astonished by them, may attach
to images a belief in their divine power and influence. Hence it is that the stone was cut by
the augur with a razor; that Juno of Veii answered that she wished to remove to Rome; that
Fortuna Muliebris336 announced the threatening danger; that the ship followed the hand
of Claudia; that Juno when plundered, and the Locrian Proserpine, and the Milesian Ceres,
punished the sacrilegious; that Hercules exacted vengeance from Appius, and Jupiter from
Atinius, and Minerva from Cæsar. Hence it was that the serpent sent for from Epidaurus
freed the city of Rome from pestilence. For the chief of the demons was himself carried
thither in his own form, without any dissembling; if indeed the ambassadors who were sent
for that purpose brought with them a serpent of immense size.</p>
<p>But they especially deceive in the case of oracles, the juggleries of which the profane337
cannot distinguish from the truth; and therefore they imagine that commands,338 and victories,
and wealth, and prosperous issues of affairs, are bestowed by them,—in short, that
the state has often been freed from imminent dangers by their interposition;339 which
dangers they have both announced, and when appeased with sacrifices, have averted. But
all these things are deceits. For since they have a presentiment340 of the arrangements of
God, inasmuch as they have been His ministers, they interpose themselves in these matters,
that whatever things have been accomplished or are in the course of accomplishment by
God, they themselves may especially appear to be doing or to have done; and as often as
any advantage is hanging over any people or city, according to the purpose of God, either

by prodigies, or dreams, or oracles, they promise that they will bring it to pass, if temples,
honours, and sacrifices are given to them. And on the offering of these, when the necessary341
result comes to pass, they acquire for themselves the greatest veneration. Hence temples are
vowed, and new images consecrated; herds of victims are slain; and when all these things
are done, yet the life and safety of those who have performed them are not the less sacrificed.
But as often as dangers threaten, they profess that they are angry on account of some light
and trifling cause; as Juno was with Varro, because he had placed a beautiful boy on the
carriage342 of Jupiter to guard the dress, and on this account the Roman name was almost
destroyed at Cannæ. But if Juno feared a second Ganymede, why did the Roman youth
suffer punishment? Or if the gods regard the leaders only, and neglect the rest of the multitude,
why did Varro alone escape who acted thus, and why was Paulus, who was innocent,343
slain? Assuredly nothing then happened to the Romans by “the fates of the hostile Juno,”344
when Hannibal by craft and valour despatched two armies of the Roman people. For Juno
did not venture either to defend Carthage, where were her arms and chariot, or to injure
the Romans; for
<lg>
<l>“She had heard that sons of Troy</l>
<l>Were born her Carthage to destroy.”345</l>
</lg>
But these are the delusions of those who, concealing themselves under the names of the
dead, lay snares for the living. Therefore, whether the impending danger can be avoided,
they wish it to appear that they averted it, having been appeased; or if it cannot be avoided,
they contrive that it may appear to have happened through disregard346 of them. Thus they
acquire to themselves authority and fear from men, who are ignorant of them. By this subtilty
and by these arts they have caused the knowledge of the true and only God to fail347 among
all nations. For, being destroyed by their own vices, they rage and use violence that they
may destroy others. Therefore these enemies of the human race even devised human victims,
to devour as many lives as possible.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF THE PATIENCE AND VENGEANCE OF GOD, THE WORSHIP
OF DEMONS, AND FALSE RELIGIONS.</head>
<p>Some one will say, Why then does God permit these things to be done, and not apply
a remedy to such disastrous errors? That evils may be at variance with good; that vices may
be opposed to virtues; that He may have some whom He may punish, and others whom He
may honour. For He has determined at the last times to pass judgment on the living and
the dead, concerning which judgment I shall speak in the last book. He delays,348 therefore,
until the end of the times shall come, when He may pour out His wrath with heavenly power
and might, as
<lg>
<l>“Prophecies of pious seers</l>
<l>Ring terror in the ’wildered ears.”349</l>
</lg>
But now He suffers men to err, and to be impious even towards Himself, just, and mild, and
patient as He is. For it is impossible that He in whom is perfect excellence should not also
be of perfect patience. Whence some imagine, that God is altogether free from anger, because
He is not subject to affections, which are perturbations of the mind; for every animal which
is liable to affections and emotions is frail. But this persuasion altogether takes away truth
and religion. But let this subject of discussing the anger of God be laid aside for the present;
because the matter is very copious, and to be more widely treated in a work devoted to the
subject. Whoever shall have worshipped and followed these most wicked spirits, will neither
enjoy heaven nor the light, which are God’s; but will fall into those things which we have
spoken of as being assigned in the distribution of things to the prince of the evil ones himself,—
namely, into darkness, and hell, and everlasting punishment.</p>
<p>I have shown that the religious rites of the gods are vain in a threefold manner: In the
first place, because those images which are worshipped are representations of men who are
dead; and that is a wrong and inconsistent thing, that the image of a man should be worshipped
by the image of God, for that which worships is lower and weaker than that which
is worshipped: then that it is an inexpiable crime to desert the living in order that you may
serve memorials of the dead, who can neither give life nor light to any one, for they are
themselves without it: and that there is no other God but one, to whose judgment and power
every soul is subject. In the second place, that the sacred images themselves, to which most
senseless men do service, are destitute of all perception, since they are earth. But who cannot
<note type="footnote">348 Jerome says “Great is the anger of God when He does not correct sins, but punishes blindness with
blindness. On this very account God sends strong delusion, as St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, that they
should believe a lie, that they all may be damned who have not believed the truth. They are unworthy of the
living fountain who dig for themselves cisterns.”</note>

understand that it is unlawful for an upright animal to bend itself that it may adore the
earth? which is placed beneath our feet for this purpose, that it may be trodden upon, and
not adored by us, who have been raised from it, and have received an elevated position
beyond the other living creatures, that we may not turn ourselves again downward, nor cast
this heavenly countenance to the earth, but may direct our eyes to that quarter to which the
condition of their nature has directed, and that we may adore and worship nothing except
the single deity of our only Creator and Father, who made man of an erect figure, that we
may know that we are called forth to high and heavenly things. In the third place, because
the spirits which preside over the religious rites themselves, being condemned and cast off
by God, wallow350 over the earth, who not only are unable to afford any advantage to their
worshippers, since the power of all things is in the hands of one alone, but even destroy
them with deadly attractions and errors; since this is their daily business, to involve men in
darkness, that the true God may not be sought by them. Therefore they are not to be worshipped,
because they lie under the sentence of God. For it is a very great crime to devote351
one’s self to the power of those whom, if you follow righteousness, you are able to excel in
power, and to drive out and put to flight by adjuration of the divine name. But if it appears
that these religious rites are vain in so many ways as I have shown, it is manifest that those
who either make prayers to the dead,352 or venerate the earth, or make over353 their souls
to unclean spirits, do not act as becomes men, and that they will suffer punishment for their
impiety and guilt, who, rebelling against God, the Father of the human race, have undertaken
inexpiable rites, and violated every sacred law.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES AND EARTHLY OBJECTS.</head>
<p>Whoever, therefore, is anxious to observe the obligations to which man is liable, and to
maintain a regard for his nature, let him raise himself from the ground, and, with mind lifted
up, let him direct his eyes to heaven: let him not seek God under his feet, nor dig up from
his footprints an object of veneration, for whatever lies beneath man must necessarily be
inferior to man; but let him seek it aloft, let him seek it in the highest place: for nothing can
be greater than man, except that which is above man. But God is greater than man: therefore
He is above, and not below; nor is He to be sought in the lowest, but rather in the highest
region. Wherefore it is undoubted that there is no religion wherever there is an image.354
For if religion consists of divine things, and there is nothing divine except in heavenly things;
it follows that images are without religion, because there can be nothing heavenly in that
which is made from the earth. And this, indeed, may be plain to a wise man from the very
name.355 For whatever is an imitation, that must of necessity be false; nor can anything receive
the name of a true object which counterfeits the truth by deception and imitation. But
if all imitation is not particularly a serious matter, but as it were a sport and jest, then there
is no religion in images, but a mimicry of religion. That which is true is therefore to be
preferred to all things which are false; earthly things are to be trampled upon, that we may
obtain heavenly things. For this is the state of the case, that whosoever shall prostrate his
soul, which has its origin from heaven, to the shades356 beneath, and the lowest things, must
fall to that place to which he has cast himself. Therefore he ought to be mindful of his nature
and condition, and always to strive and aim at things above. And whoever shall do this, he
will be judged altogether wise, he just, he a man: he, in short, will be judged worthy of
heaven whom his Parent will recognise not as abject, nor cast down to the earth after the
manner of the beasts,357 but rather standing and upright as He made him.</p>

<p>A great and difficult portion of the work which I have undertaken, unless I am deceived,
has been completed; and the majesty of heaven supplying the power of speaking, we have
driven away inveterate errors. But now a greater and more difficult contest with philosophers
is proposed to us, the height of whose learning and eloquence, as some massive structure,
is opposed to me. For as in the former358 case we were oppressed by a multitude, and almost
by the universal agreement of all nations, so in this subject we are oppressed by the authority
of men excelling in every kind of praise. But who can be ignorant that there is more weight
in a smaller number of learned men than in a greater number of ignorant persons?359 But
we must not despair that, under the guidance of God and the truth, these also may be turned
aside from their opinion; nor do I think that they will be so obstinate as to deny that they
behold with sound and open eyes the sun as he shines in his brilliancy. Only let that be true
which they themselves are accustomed to profess, that they are possessed with the desire of
investigation, and I shall assuredly succeed in causing them to believe that the truth which
they have long sought for has been at length found, and to confess that it could not have
been found by the abilities of man.</p>

OF THE FALSE WISDOM OF PHILOSOPHERS.</head>

<pb n="145"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—A COMPARISON OF THE TRUTH WITH ELOQUENCE: WHY THE
PHILOSOPHERS DID NOT ATTAIN TO IT. OF THE SIMPLE STYLE OF THE
SCRIPTURES.</head>
<p>Since it is supposed that the truth still lies hidden in obscurity—either through the error
and ignorance of the common people, who are the slaves of various and foolish superstitions,
or through the philosophers, who by the perverseness of their minds confuse rather than
throw light upon it—I could wish that the power of eloquence had fallen to my lot, though
not such as it was in Marcus Tullius, for that was extraordinary and admirable, but in some
degree approaching it;360 that, being supported as much by the strength of talent as it has
weight by its own force, the truth might at length come forth, and having dispelled and refuted
public errors, and the errors of those who are considered wise, might introduce among
the human race a brilliant light. And I could wish that this were so, for two reasons: either
that men might more readily believe the truth when adorned with embellishments, since
they even believe falsehood, being captivated by the adornment of speech and the enticement
of words; or, at all events, that the philosophers themselves might be overpowered by us,
most of all by their own arms, in which they are accustomed to pride themselves and to
place confidence.</p>
<p>But since God has willed this to be the nature of the case, that simple and undisguised
truth should be more clear, because it has sufficient ornament of itself, and on this account
it is corrupted when embellished361 with adornings from without, but that falsehood should
please by means of a splendour not its own, because being corrupt of itself it vanishes and
melts away, unless it is set off362 and polished with decoration sought from another source;
I bear it with equanimity that a moderate degree of talent has been granted to me. But it is
not in reliance upon eloquence, but upon the truth, that I have undertaken this work,—a
work, perhaps, too great to be sustained by my strength; which, however, even if I should
fail, the truth itself will complete, with the assistance of God, whose office this is. For when
I know that the greatest orators have often been overcome by pleaders of moderate ability,
because the power of truth is so great that it defends itself even in small things by its own
clearness: why should I imagine that it will be overwhelmed in a cause of the greatest importance
by men who are ingenious and eloquent, as I admit, but who speak false things; and
not that it should appear bright and illustrious, if not by our speech, which is very feeble,
and flows from a slight fountain, but by its own light? Nor, if there have been philosophers
worthy of admiration on account of their literary erudition, should I also yield to them the
<note type="footnote">360 [A modest confession of his desire to “find out acceptable words.” Eccles. xii. 10. His success is proverbial.]</note>
<note type="footnote">361 Stained, counterfeit.</note>
<note type="footnote">362 Embellished.</note>

<pb n="146"/>
knowledge and learning of the truth, which no one can attain to by reflection or disputation.
Nor do I now disparage the pursuit of those who wished to know the truth, because God
has made the nature of man most desirous of arriving at the truth; but I assert and maintain
this against them, that the effect did not follow their honest and well-directed will, because
they neither knew what was true in itself, nor how, nor where, nor with what mind it is to
be sought. And thus, while they desire to remedy the errors of men, they have become entangled
in snares and the greatest errors. I have therefore been led to this task of refuting
philosophy by the very order of the subject which I have undertaken.</p>
<p>For since all error arises either from false religion or from wisdom,363364 in refuting
error it is necessary to overthrow both. For inasmuch as it has been handed down to us in
the sacred writings that the thoughts of philosophers are foolish, this very thing is to be
proved by fact and by arguments, that no one, induced by the honourable name of wisdom,
or deceived by the splendour of empty eloquence, may prefer to give credence to human
rather than to divine things. Which things, indeed, are related in a concise and simple
manner. For it was not befitting that, when God was speaking to man, He should confirm
His words by arguments, as though He would not otherwise365 be regarded with confidence:
but, as it was right, He spoke as the mighty Judge of all things, to whom it belongs not to
argue, but to pronounce sentence. He Himself, as God, is truth. But we, since we have divine
testimony for everything, will assuredly show by how much surer arguments truth may be
defended, when even false things are so defended that they are accustomed to appear true.
Wherefore there is no reason why we should give so much honour to philosophers as to
fear their eloquence. For they might speak well as men of learning; but they could not speak
truly, because they had not learned the truth from Him in whose power it was. Nor, indeed,
shall we effect anything great in convicting them of ignorance, which they themselves very
often confess. Since they are not believed in that one point alone in which alone they ought
to have been believed, I will endeavour to show that they never spoke so truly as when they
uttered their opinion respecting their own ignorance.</p>

<head>CHAP. II.—OF PHILOSOPHY, AND HOW VAIN WAS ITS OCCUPATION IN
SETTING FORTH THE TRUTH.</head>
<p>Now, since the falsehood of superstitions366 has been shown in the two former books,
and the origin itself of the whole error has been set forth, it is the business of this book to
show the emptiness and falsehood of philosophy also, that, all error being removed, the
truth may be brought to light and become manifest. Let us begin, therefore, from the common
name of philosophy, that when the head itself is destroyed, an easier approach may be open
to us for demolishing the whole body; if indeed that can be called a body, the parts and
members of which are at variance with one another, and are not united together by any
connecting link,367 but, as it were, dispersed and scattered, appear to palpitate rather than
to live. Philosophy is (as the name indicates, and they themselves define it) the love of wisdom.
By what argument, then, can I prove that philosophy is not wisdom, rather than by
that derived from the meaning of the name itself? For he who devotes himself to wisdom is
manifestly not yet wise, but devotes himself to the subject that he may be wise. In the other
arts it appears what this devotedness effects, and to what it tends: for when any one by
learning has attained to these, he is now called, not a devoted follower of the profession, but
an artificer. But it is said it was on account of modesty that they called themselves devoted
to wisdom, and not wise. Nay, in truth, Pythagoras, who first invented this name, since he
had a little more wisdom than those of early times, who regarded themselves as wise, understood
that it was impossible by any human study to attain to wisdom, and therefore that a
perfect name ought not to be applied to an incomprehensible and imperfect subject. And,
therefore, when he was asked what was his profession,368 he answered that he was a philosopher,
that is, a searcher after wisdom. If, therefore, philosophy searches after wisdom, it
is not wisdom itself, because it must of necessity be one thing which searches, and another
which is searched for; nor is the searching itself correct, because it can find nothing.</p>
<p>But I am not prepared to concede even that philosophers are devoted to the pursuit of
wisdom, because by that pursuit there is no attaining to wisdom. For if the power of finding
the truth were connected369 with this pursuit, and if this pursuit were a kind of road to
wisdom, it would at length be found. But since so much time and talent have been wasted
in the search for it, and it has not yet been gained, it is plain that there is no wisdom there.
<note type="footnote">366 [Religionum falsitas. He does not here employ superstitio By the way, Lactantius derives this word from
those “qui superstitem memoriam hominum, tanquam deorum, colerent.” Cicero, however, derives it from

Therefore they who apply themselves to philosophy do not devote themselves to the pursuit
of wisdom; but they themselves imagine that they do so, because they know not where that
is which they are searching for, or of what character it is. Whether, therefore, they devote
themselves to the pursuit of wisdom or not, they are not wise, because that can never be
discovered which is either sought in an improper manner, or not sought at all. Let us look
to this very thing, whether it is possible for anything to be discovered by this kind of pursuit,
or nothing.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—OF WHAT SUBJECTS PHILOSOPHY CONSISTS, AND WHO WAS THE
CHIEF FOUNDER OF THE ACADEMIC SECT.</head>
<p>Philosophy appears to consist of two subjects, knowledge and conjecture, and of nothing
more. Knowledge cannot come from the understanding, nor be apprehended by thought;
because to have knowledge in oneself as a peculiar property does not belong to man, but to
God. But the nature of mortals does not receive knowledge, except that which comes from
without. For on this account the divine intelligence has opened the eyes and ears and other
senses in the body, that by these entrances knowledge might flow through to the mind. For
to investigate or wish to know the causes of natural things,—whether the sun is as great as
it appears to be, or is many times greater than the whole of this earth; also whether the moon
be spherical or concave; and whether the stars are fixed to the heaven, or are borne with
free course through the air; of what magnitude the heaven itself is, of what material it is
composed; whether it is at rest and immoveable, or is turned round with incredible swiftness;
how great is the thickness of the earth, or on what foundations it is poised and suspended,—to
wish to comprehend these things, I say, by disputation and conjectures, is as though we
should wish to discuss what we may suppose to be the character of a city in some very remote
country, which we have never seen, and of which we have heard nothing more than the
name. If we should claim to ourselves knowledge in a matter of this kind, which cannot be
known, should we not appear to be mad, in venturing to affirm that in which we may be
refuted? How much more are they to be judged mad and senseless, who imagine that they
know natural things, which cannot be known by man! Rightly therefore did Socrates, and
the Academics370 who followed him, take away knowledge, which is not the part of a disputant,
but of a diviner. It remains that there is in philosophy conjecture only; for that from
which knowledge is absent, is entirely occupied by conjecture. For every one conjectures
that of which he is ignorant. But they who discuss natural subjects, conjecture that they are
as they discuss them. Therefore they do not know the truth, because knowledge is concerned
with that which is certain, conjecture with the uncertain.</p>
<p>Let us return to the example before mentioned. Come, let us conjecture about the state
and character of that city which is unknown to us in all respects except in name. It is probable
that it is situated on a plain, with walls of stone, lofty buildings, many streets, magnificent
and highly adorned temples. Let us describe, if you please, the customs and deportment of
the citizens. But when we shall have described these, another will make opposite statements;
and when he also shall have concluded, a third will arise, and others after him; and they will

make very different conjectures to those of ours. Which therefore of all is more true? Perhaps
none of them. But all things have been mentioned which the nature of the circumstances
admits, so that some one of them must necessarily be true. But it will not be known who
has spoken the truth. It may possibly be that all have in some degree erred in their description,
and that all have in some degree attained to the truth. Therefore we are foolish if we seek
this by disputation; for some one may present himself who may deride our conjectures, and
esteem us as mad, since we wish to conjecture the character of that which we do not know.
But it is unnecessary to go in quest of remote cases, from which perhaps no one may come
to refute us. Come, let us conjecture what is now going on in the forum, what in the senatehouse.
That also is too distant. Let us say what is taking place with the interposition of a
single wall;371 no one can know this but he who has heard or seen it. No one therefore
ventures to say this, because he will immediately be refuted not by words, but by the presence
of the fact itself. But this is the very thing which philosophers do, who discuss what is taking
place in heaven, but think that they do that with impunity, because there is no one to refute
their errors. But if they were to think that some one was about to descend who would prove
them to be mad and false, they would never discuss those subjects at all which they cannot
possibly know. Nor, however, is their shamelessness and audacity to be regarded as more
successful because they are not refuted; for God refutes them to whom alone the truth is
known, although He may seem to connive at their conduct, and He reckons such wisdom
of men as the greatest folly.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—THAT KNOWLEDGE IS TAKEN AWAY BY SOCRATES, AND
CONJECTURE BY ZENO.</head>
<p>Zeno and the Stoics, then, were right in repudiating conjecture. For to conjecture that
you know that which you do not know, is not the part of a wise, but rather of a rash and
foolish man. Therefore if nothing can be known, as Socrates taught, or ought to be conjectured,
as Zeno taught, philosophy is entirely removed. Why should I say that it is not only
overthrown by these two, who were the chiefs of philosophy, but by all, so that it now appears
to have been long ago destroyed by its own arms? Philosophy has been divided into many
sects; and they all entertain various sentiments. In which do we place the truth? It certainly
cannot be in all. Let us point out some one; it follows that all the others will be without
wisdom. Let us pass through them separately; in the same manner, whatever we shall give
to one we shall take away from the others. For each particular sect overturns all others, to
confirm itself and its own doctrines: nor does it allow wisdom to any other, lest it should
confess that it is itself foolish; but as it takes away others, so is it taken away itself by all
others. For they are nevertheless philosophers who accuse it of folly. Whatever sect you shall
praise and pronounce true, that is censured by philosophers as false. Shall we therefore believe
one which praises itself and its doctrine, or the many which blame the ignorance of each
other? That must of necessity be better which is held by great numbers, than that which is
held by one only. For no one can rightly judge concerning himself, as the renowned poet
testifies;372 for the nature of men is so arranged, that they see and distinguish the affairs of
others better than their own. Since, therefore, all things are uncertain, we must either believe
all or none: if we are to believe no one, then the wise have no existence, because while they
separately affirm different things they think themselves wise; if all, it is equally true that
there are no wise men, because all deny the wisdom of each individually. Therefore all are
in this manner destroyed; and as those fabled sparti373 of the poets, so these men mutually
slay one another, so that no one remains of all; which happens on this account, because they
have a sword, but have no shield. If, therefore, the sects individually are convicted of folly
by the judgment of many sects, it follows that all are found to be vain and empty; and thus
philosophy consumes and destroys itself. And since Arcesilas the founder of the Academy
understood this, he collected together the mutual censures of all, and the confession of ignorance
made by distinguished philosophers, and armed himself against all. Thus he established
a new philosophy of not philosophizing. From this founder, therefore, there began
to be two kinds of philosophy: one the old one, which claims to itself knowledge; the other
a new one, opposed to the former, and which detracts from it. Between these two kinds of
philosophy I see that there is disagreement, and as it were civil war. On which side shall we

place wisdom, which cannot be torn asunder?374375 If the nature of things can be known,
this troop of recruits will perish; if it cannot, the veterans will be destroyed: if they shall be
equal, nevertheless philosophy, the guide of all, will still perish, because it is divided; for
nothing can be opposed to itself without its own destruction. But if, as I have shown, there
can be no inner and peculiar knowledge in man on account of the frailty of the human
condition, the party of Arcesilas prevails. But not even will this stand firm, because it cannot
be the case that nothing at all is known.</p>

<head>CHAP. V.—THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS IS NECESSARY.</head>
<p>For there are many things which nature itself, and frequent use, and the necessity of
life, compel us to know. Accordingly you must perish, unless you know what things are
useful for life, in order that you may seek them; and what are dangerous, that you may shun
and avoid them. Moreover, there are many things which experience finds out. For the various
courses of the sun and moon, and the motions of the stars, and the computation of times,
have been discovered, and the nature of bodies, and the strength of herbs by students of
medicine, and by the cultivators of the land the nature of soils, and signs of future rains and
tempests have been collected. In short, there is no art which is not dependent on knowledge.
Therefore Arcesilas ought, if he had any wisdom, to have distinguished the things which
were capable of being known, and those which were incapable. But if he had done this, he
would have reduced himself to the common herd. For the common people have sometimes
more wisdom, because they are only so far wise as is necessary. And if you inquire of them
whether they know anything or nothing, they will say that they know the things which they
know, and will confess that they are ignorant of what they are ignorant. He was right,
therefore, in taking away the systems of others, but he was not right in laying the foundations
of his own. For ignorance of all things cannot be wisdom, the peculiar property of which is
knowledge. And thus, when he overcame the philosophers, and taught that they knew
nothing, he himself also lost the name of philosopher, because his system is to know nothing.
For he who blames others because they are ignorant, ought himself to have knowledge; but
when he knows nothing, what perverseness or what insolence it is, to constitute himself a
philosopher on account of that very thing for which he takes away the others! For it is in
their power to answer thus: If you convict us of knowing nothing, and therefore of being
unwise because we know nothing, does it follow that you are not wise, because you confess
that you know nothing? What progress, therefore, did Arcesilas make, except that, having
despatched all the philosophers, he pierced himself also with the same sword?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="154"/>
<head>CHAP. VI.—OF WISDOM, AND THE ACADEMICS, AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.</head>
<p>Does wisdom therefore nowhere exist? Yes, indeed, it was amongst them, but no one
saw it. Some thought that all things could be known: these were manifestly not wise. Others
thought that nothing could be known; nor indeed were these wise: the former, because they
attributed too much to man; the latter, because they attributed too little. A limit was wanting
to each on either side. Where, then, is wisdom? It consists in thinking neither that you know
all things, which is the property of God; nor that you are ignorant of all things, which is the
part of a beast. For it is something of a middle character which belongs to man, that is,
knowledge united and combined with ignorance. Knowledge in us is from the soul, which
has its origin from heaven; ignorance from the body, which is from the earth: whence we
have something in common with God, and with the animal creation. Thus, since we are
composed of these two elements, the one of which is endowed with light, the other with
darkness, a part of knowledge is given to us, and a part of ignorance. Over this bridge, so
to speak, we may pass without any danger of falling; for all those who have inclined to either
side, either towards the left hand or the right, have fallen. But I will say how each part has
erred. The Academics argued from obscure subjects, against the natural philosophers, that
there was no knowledge; and satisfied with the examples of a few incomprehensible subjects,
they embraced ignorance as though they had taken away the whole of knowledge, because
they had taken it away in part. But natural philosophers, on the other hand, derived their
argument from those things which are open, and inferred that all things could be known,
and, satisfied with things which were manifest, retained knowledge; as if they had defended
it altogether, because they had defended it in part. And thus neither the one saw what was
clear, nor the others what was obscure; but each party, while they contended with the greatest
ardour either to retain or to take away knowledge only, did not see that there would be
placed in the middle that which might guide them to wisdom.</p>
<p>But Arcesilas, who teaches that there is no knowledge,376 when he was detracting from
Zeno, the chief of the Stoics, that he might altogether overthrow philosophy on the authority
of Socrates, undertook this opinion to affirm that nothing could be known. And thus he
disproved the judgment of the philosophers, who had thought that the truth was drawn
forth,377 and found out by their talents,—namely, because that wisdom was mortal, and,
having been instituted a few ages before, had now attained to its greatest increase, so that
it was now necessarily growing old and perishing, the Academy378 suddenly arose, the old
<note type="footnote">376 The master of ignorance.</note>
<note type="footnote">377 Erutam.</note>
<note type="footnote">378 The New Academy.</note>

<pb n="155"/>
age, as it were, of philosophy, which might despatch it now withering. And Arcesilas rightly
saw that they are arrogant, or rather foolish, who imagine that the knowledge of the truth
can be arrived at by conjecture. But no one can refute one speaking falsely, unless he who
shall have previously known what is true; but Arcesilas, endeavouring to do this without a
knowledge of the truth, introduced a kind of philosophy which we may call unstable or inconstant.
379 For, that nothing may be known, it is necessary that something be known. For
if you know nothing at all, the very knowledge that nothing can be known will be taken
away. Therefore he who pronounces as a sentiment that nothing is known, professes, as it
were, some conclusion already arrived at and known: therefore it is possible for something
to be known.</p>
<p>Of a similar character to this is that which is accustomed to be proposed in the schools
as an example of the kind of fallacy called asystaton; that some one had dreamt that he
should not believe dreams. For if he did believe them, then it follows that he ought not to
believe them. But if he did not believe them, then it follows that he ought to believe them.
Thus, if nothing can be known, it is necessary that this fact must be known, that nothing is
known. But if it is known that nothing can be known, the statement that nothing can be
known must as a consequence be false. Thus there is introduced a tenet opposed to itself,
and destructive of itself. But the evasive380 man wished to take away learning from the
other philosophers, that he might conceal it at his home. For truly he is not for taking it
from himself who affirms anything that he may take it from others: but he does not succeed;
for it shows itself, and betrays its plunderer. How much more wisely and truly he would act,
if he should make an exception, and say that the causes and systems of heavenly things only,
or natural things, because they are hidden, cannot be known, for there is no one to teach
them; and ought not to be inquired into, for they cannot be found out by inquiry! For if he
had brought forward this exception, he would both have admonished the natural philosophers
not to search into those things which exceeded the limit of human reflection; and would
have freed himself from the ill-will arising from calumny, and would certainly have left us
something to follow. But now, since he has drawn us back from following others, that we
may not wish to know more than we are capable of knowing, he has no less drawn us back
from himself also. For who would wish to labour lest he should know anything? or to undertake
learning of this kind that he may even lose ordinary knowledge? For if this learning
exists, it must necessarily consist of knowledge; if it does not exist, who is so foolish as to
think that that is worthy of being learned, in which either nothing is learned, or something

is even unlearned? Wherefore, if all things cannot be known, as the natural philosophers
thought, nor nothing, as the Academics taught, philosophy is altogether extinguished.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY, AND THE CHIEF GOOD.</head>
<p>Let us now pass to the other part of philosophy, which they themselves call moral, in
which is contained the method of the whole of philosophy, since in natural philosophy there
is only delight, in this there is utility also. And since it is more dangerous to commit a fault
in arranging the condition of life and in forming the character, greater diligence must be
used, that we may know how we ought to live. For in the former subject381 some indulgence
may be granted: for whether they say anything, they bestow no advantage; or if they foolishly
rave, they do no injury. But in this subject there is no room for difference of opinion, none
for error. All must entertain the same sentiments, and philosophy itself must give instructions
as it were with one mouth; because if any error shall be committed, life is altogether overthrown.
In that former part, as there is less danger, so there is more difficulty; because the
obscurity of the subject compels us to entertain different and various opinions. But in this,
as there is more danger, so there is less difficulty; because the very use of the subjects and
daily experiments are able to teach what is truer and better. Let us see, therefore, whether
they agree, or what assistance they give us for the better guidance of life. It is not necessary
to enlarge on every point; let us select one, and especially that which is the chief and principal
thing, in which the whole of wisdom centres and depends.382 Epicurus deems that the
chief good consists in pleasure of mind, Aristippus in pleasure of the body. Callipho and
Dinomachus united virtue with pleasure, Diodorus with the privation of pain, Hieronymus
placed the chief good in the absence of pain; the Peripatetics, again, in the goods of the mind,
the body, and fortune. The chief good of Herillus is knowledge; that of Zeno, to live agreeably
to nature; that of certain Stoics, to follow virtue. Aristotle placed the chief good in integrity
and virtue. These are the sentiments of nearly all. In such a difference of opinions, whom
do we follow? whom do we believe? All are of equal authority. If we are able to select that
which is better, it follows that philosophy is not necessary for us; because we are already
wise, inasmuch as we judge respecting the opinions of the wise. But since we come for the
sake of learning wisdom, how can we judge, who have not yet begun to be wise? especially
when the Academic is close at hand, to draw us back by the cloak, and forbid us to believe
any one, without bringing forward that which we may follow.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE CHIEF GOOD, AND THE PLEASURES OF THE SOUL AND
BODY, AND OF VIRTUE.</head>
<p>What then remains, but that we leave raving and obstinate wranglers, and come to the
judge, who is in truth the giver of simple and calm wisdom? which is able not only to mould
us, and lead us into the way, but also to pass an opinion on the controversies of those men.
This teaches us what is the true and highest good of man; but before I begin to speak on this
subject, all those opinions must be refuted, that it may appear that no one of those philosophers
was wise. Since the inquiry is respecting the duty of man, the chief good of the chief animal
ought to be placed in that which it cannot have in common with the other animals.
But as teeth are the peculiar property of wild beasts, horns of cattle, and wings of birds, so
something peculiar to himself ought to be attributed to man, without which he would lose
the fixed383 order of his condition. For that which is given to all for the purpose of life or
generation, is indeed a natural good; but still it is not the greatest, unless it be peculiar to
each class. Therefore he was not a wise man who believed that pleasure of the mind is the
chief good, since that, whether it be freedom from anxiety or joy, is common to all. I do not
consider Aristippus even worthy of an answer; for since he is always rushing into pleasures
of the body, and is only the slave of sensual indulgences, no one can regard him as a man:
for he lived in such a manner that there was no difference between him and a brute, except
this only, that he had the faculty of speech. But if the power of speaking were given to the
ass, or the dog, or swine, and you were to inquire from these why they so furiously pursue
the females, that they can scarcely be separated from them, and even neglect their food and
I drink; why they either drive away other males, or do not abstain from the pursuit even
when vanquished, but often, when bruised by stronger animals, they are more determined
in their pursuit; why they dread neither rain nor cold; why they undertake labour, and do
not shrink from danger;—what other answer will they give, but that the chief good is bodily
pleasure?—that they eagerly seek it, in order that they may be affected with the most agreeable
sensations; and that these are of so much importance, that, for the sake of attaining them,
they imagine that no labour, nor wounds, nor death itself, ought to be refused by them?
Shall we then seek precepts of living from these men, who have no other feelings than those
of the irrational creatures?</p>
<p>The Cyrenaics say that virtue itself is to be praised on this account, because it is productive
of pleasure. True, says the filthy dog, or the swine wallowing in the mire.384 For it is on
this account that I contend with my adversary with the utmost exertion of strength, that my
valour may procure for me pleasure; of which I must necessarily be deprived if I shall come
off vanquished. Shall we therefore learn wisdom from these men, who differ from cattle and

<note type="footnote">384 [Sus ille lutulentus. 2 Pet. ii. 22.]</note>

<pb n="159"/>
the brutes, not in feeling, but in language? To regard the absence of pain as the chief good,
is not indeed the part of Peripatetic and Stoic, but of clinical philosophers. For who would
not imagine that the discussion was carried on by those who were ill, and under the influence
of some pain? What is so ridiculous, as to esteem that the chief good which the physician
is able to give? We must therefore feel pain in order that we may enjoy good; and that, too,
severely and frequently, that afterwards the absence of pain may be attended with greater
pleasure. He is therefore most wretched who has never felt pain, because he is without that
which is good; whereas we used to regard him as most happy, because he was without evil.
He was not far distant from this folly, who said that the entire absence of pain was the chief
good. For, besides the fact that every animal avoids pain, who can bestow upon himself that
good, towards the obtaining of which we can do no more than wish? But the chief good
cannot make any one happy, unless it shall be always in his power; and it is not virtue, nor
learning, nor labour, which affords this to man, but nature herself bestows it upon all living
creatures. They who joined pleasure with virtuous principle, wished to avoid this common
blending together of all, but they made a contradictory kind of good; since he who is abandoned
to pleasure must of necessity be destitute of virtuous principle, and he who aims at
principle must be destitute of pleasure.</p>
<p>The chief good of the Peripatetics may possibly appear excessive, various, and—excepting
those goods which belong to the mind, and what they are is a great subject of dispute—common
to man with the beasts. For goods belonging to the body—that is, safety, freedom from
pain, health—are no less necessary for dumb creatures than for man; and I know not if they
are not more necessary for them, because man can be relieved by remedies and services, the
dumb animals cannot. The same is true of those which they call the goods of fortune; for as
man has need of resources for the support of life, so have they385 need of prey and pasture.
Thus, by introducing a good which is not within the power of man, they made man altogether
subject to the power of another. Let us also hear Zeno, for he at times dreams of virtue. The
chief good, he says, is to live in accordance with nature. Therefore we must live after the
manner of the brutes. For in these are found all the things which ought to be absent from
man: they are eager for pleasures, they fear, they deceive, they lie in wait, they kill; and that
which is especially to the point, they have no knowledge of God. Why, therefore, does he
teach me to live according to nature, which is of itself prone to a worse course, and under
the influence of some more soothing blandishments plunges headlong into vices? Or if he
says that the nature of brutes is different from the nature of man, because man is born to
virtue, he says something to the purpose; but, however, it will not be a definition of the chief
good, because there is no animal which does not live in accordance with its nature.</p>
<note type="footnote">385 They, i.e., the beasts of prey and the tame animals.</note>

<pb n="160"/>
<p>He who made knowledge the chief good, gave something peculiar to man; but men desire
knowledge for the sake of something else, and not for its own sake. For who is contented
with knowing, without seeking some advantage from his knowledge? The arts are learned
for the purpose of being put into exercise; but they are exercised either for the support of
life, or pleasure, or for glory. That, therefore, is not the chief good which is not sought for
on its own account. What difference, therefore, does it make, whether we consider knowledge
to be the chief good, or those very things which knowledge produces from itself, that is,
means of subsistence, glory, pleasure? And these things are not peculiar to man, and therefore
they are not the chief goods; for the desire of pleasure and of food does not exist in man
alone, but also in the brutes. How is it with regard to the desire of glory? Is it not discovered
in horses, since they exult in victory, and are grieved when vanquished? “So great is their
love of praises, so great is their eagerness for victory.”386 Nor without reason does that most
excellent poet say that we must try “what grief they feel when overcome, and how they rejoice
in victory.” But if those things which knowledge produces are common to man with other
animals, it follows that knowledge is not the chief good. Moreover, it is no slight fault of
this definition that bare knowledge is set forth. For all will begin to appear happy who shall
have the knowledge of any art, even those who shall know mischievous subjects; so that he
who shall have learned to mix poisons, is as happy as he who has learned to apply remedies.
I ask, therefore, to what subject knowledge is to be referred. If to the causes of natural things,
what happiness will be proposed to me, if I shall know the sources of the Nile, or the vain
dreams of the natural philosophers respecting the heaven? Why should I mention that on
these subjects there is no knowledge, but mere conjecture, which varies according to the
abilities of men? It only remains that the knowledge of good and evil things is the chief good.
Why, then, did he call knowledge the chief good more than wisdom, when both words have
the same signification and meaning? But no one has yet said that the chief good is wisdom,
though this might more properly have been said. For knowledge is insufficient for the undertaking
of that which is good and avoiding that which is evil, unless virtue also is added.
For many of the philosophers, though they discussed the nature of good and evil things, yet
from the compulsion of nature lived in a manner different from their discourse, because
they were without virtue. But virtue united with knowledge is wisdom.</p>
<p>It remains that we refute those also who judged virtue itself to be the chief good, and
Marcus Tullius was also of this opinion; and in this they were very inconsiderate.387 For
virtue itself is not the chief good, but it is the contriver and mother of the chief good; for
this cannot be attained without virtue. Each point is easily understood. For I ask whether
they imagine that it is easy to arrive at that distinguished good, or that it is reached only
<note type="footnote">386 Virg., Georg., iii. 112, 102.</note>
<note type="footnote">387 [De Finibus, book v. cap. 28.]</note>

<pb n="161"/>
with difficulty and labour? Let them apply their ingenuity, and defend error. If it is easily
attained to, and without labour, it cannot be the chief good. For why should we torment
ourselves, why wear ourselves out with striving day and night, seeing that the object of our
pursuit is so close at hand, that any one who wishes may grasp it without any effort of the
mind? But if we do not attain even to a common and moderate good except by labour, since
good things are by their nature arduous and difficult,388 whereas evil things have a downward
tendency, it follows that the greatest labour is necessary for the attainment of the greatest
good. And if this is most true, then there is need of another virtue, that we may arrive at
that virtue which is called the chief good; but this is incongruous and absurd, that virtue
should arrive at itself by means of itself. If no good can be reached unless by labour, it is
evident that it is virtue by which it is reached, since the force and office of virtue consist in
the undertaking and carrying through of labours. Therefore the chief good cannot be that
by which it is necessary to arrive at another. But they, since they were ignorant of the effects
and tendency of virtue, and could discover nothing more honourable, stopped at the very
name of virtue, and said that it ought to be sought, though no advantage was proposed from
it; and thus they fixed for themselves a good which itself stood in need of a good. From these
Aristotle was not far removed, who thought that virtue together with honour was the chief
good; as though it were possible for any virtue to exist unless it were honourable, and as
though it would not cease to be virtue if it had any measure of disgrace. But he saw that it
might happen that a bad opinion is entertained respecting virtue by a depraved judgment,
and therefore he thought that deference should be paid to what in the estimation of men
constitutes a departure from what is right and good, because it is not in our power that virtue
should be honoured simply for its own deserts. For what is honourable389 character, except
perpetual honour, conferred on any one by the favourable report of the people? What, then,
will happen, if through the error and perverseness of men a bad reputation should ensue?
Shall we cast aside virtue because it is judged to be base and disgraceful by the foolish? And
since it is capable of being oppressed and harassed, in order that it may be of itself a peculiar
and lasting good, it ought to stand in need of no outward assistance, so as not to depend by
itself upon its own strength, and to remain stedfast. And thus no good is to be hoped by it

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE CHIEF GOOD, AND THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD, AND
A REFUTATION OF ANAXAGORAS.</head>
<p>I now come to the chief good of true wisdom, the nature of which is to be determined
in this manner: first, it must be the property of man alone, and not belong to any other an-
imal; secondly, it must belong to the soul only, and not be shared with the body; lastly, it
cannot fall to the lot of any one without knowledge and virtue. Now this limitation excludes
and does away with all the opinions of those whom I have mentioned; for their sayings
contain nothing of this kind. I will now say what this is, that I may show, as I designed, that
all philosophers were blind and foolish, who could neither see, nor understand, nor surmise
at any time what was fixed as the chief good for man. Anaxagoras, when asked for what
purpose he was born, replied that he might look upon the heaven and the sun. This expression
is admired by all, and judged worthy of a philosopher. But I think that he, being unprepared
with an answer, uttered this at random, that he might390 not be silent. But if he had been
wise, he ought to have considered and reflected with himself; for if any one is ignorant of
his own condition, he cannot even he a man. But let us imagine that the saying was not
uttered on the spur of the moment. Let us see how many and what great errors he committed
in three words. First, he erred in placing the whole duty of man in the eyes alone, referring
nothing to the mind, but everything to the body. But if he had been blind, would he lose the
duty of a man, which cannot happen without the ruin391 of the soul? What of the other
parts of the body? Will they be destitute, each of its own duty? Why should I say that more
depends upon the ears than upon the eye, since learning and wisdom can be gained by the
ears only, but not by the eyes only? Were you born for the sake of seeing the heaven and
the sun? Who introduced you to this392 sight? or what does your vision contribute to the
heaven and the nature of things? Doubtless that you may praise this immense and wonderful
work. Therefore confess that God is the Creator of all things, who introduced you into this
world, as a witness and praiser of His great work. You believe that it is a great thing to behold
the heaven and the sun: why, therefore, do you not give thanks to Him who is the author
of this benefit? why do you not measure with your mind the excellence, the providence, and
the power of Him whose works you admire? For it must be, that He who created objects
worthy of admiration, is Himself much more to be admired. If any one had invited you to
dinner, and you had been well entertained, should you appear in your senses, if you esteemed
the mere pleasure more highly than the author of the pleasure? So entirely do philosophers
refer all things to the body, and nothing at all to the mind, nor do they see beyond that which
<note type="footnote">390 That he might be able to make some answer.</note>
<note type="footnote">391 The fall or overthrow.</note>
<note type="footnote">392 This sight or spectacle, that is, into this world. This expression is used for the place from which the sight
is beheld.</note>

<pb n="163"/>
fails under their eyes.393But all the offices of the body being put aside, the business of man
is to be placed in the mind alone. Therefore we are not born for this purpose, that we may
see those things which are created, but that we may contemplate, that is, behold with our
mind, the Creator of all things Himself. Wherefore, if any one should ask a man who is truly
wise for what purpose he was born, he will answer without fear or hesitation, that he was
born for the purpose of worshipping God, who brought us into being for his cause, that we
may serve Him. But to serve God is nothing else than to maintain and preserve justice by
good works. But he, as a man ignorant of divine things, reduced a matter of the greatest
magnitude to the least, by selecting two things only, which he said were to be beheld by him.
But if he had said that he was born to behold the world, although he would comprise all
things in this, and would use an expression of greater394 sound, yet he would not have
completed the duty of man; for as much as the soul excels the body, so much does God excel
the world, for God made and governs the world. Therefore it is not the world which is to
be contemplated by the eye, for each is a body;395 but it is God who is to be contemplated
by the soul: for God, being Himself immortal, willed that the soul also should be everlasting.
But the contemplation of God is the reverence and worship of the common Parent of
mankind. And if the philosophers were destitute of this, and in their ignorance of divine
things prostrated themselves to the earth, we must suppose that Anaxagoras neither beheld
the heaven nor the sun, though he said that he was born that he might behold them. The
object proposed to man is therefore plain396 and easy, if he is wise; and to it especially belongs
humanity.397 For what is humanity itself, but justice? what is justice, but piety? And piety398
is nothing else than the recognition of God as a parent.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—IT IS THE PECULIAR PROPERTY OF MAN TO KNOW AND WORSHIP
GOD.</head>
<p>Therefore the chief good of man is in religion only; for the other things, even those
which are supposed to be peculiar to man, are found in the other animals also. For when
they discern and distinguish their own voices399 by peculiar marks among themselves, they
seem to converse: they also appear to have a kind of smile, when with soothed ears, and
contracted mouth, and with eyes relaxed to sportiveness, they fawn upon man, or upon
their own mates and young. Do they not give a greeting which bears some resemblance to
mutual love and indulgence? Again, those creatures which look forward to the future and
lay up for themselves food, plainly have foresight. Indications of reason are also found in
many of them. For since they desire things useful to themselves, guard against evils, avoid
dangers, prepare for themselves lurking-places standing open in different places with various
outlets, assuredly they have some understanding. Can any one deny that they are possessed
of reason, since they often deceive man himself? For those which have the office of producing
honey, when they inhabit the place assigned to them, fortify a camp, construct dwellings
with unspeakable skill, and obey their king; I know not if there is not in them perfect
prudence. It is therefore uncertain whether those things which are given to man are common
to him with other living creatures: they are certainly without religion. I indeed thus judge,
that reason is given to all animals, but to the dumb creatures only for the protection of life,
to man also for its prolongation. And because reason itself is perfect in man, it is named
wisdom, which renders man distinguished in this respect, that to him alone it is given to
comprehend divine things. And concerning this the opinion of Cicero is true: “Of so many
kinds of animals,” he says, “there is none except man which has any knowledge of God; and
among men themselves, there is no nation either so uncivilized or so savage, which, even if
it is ignorant of due conceptions of the Deity, does not know that some conception of Him
ought to be entertained.” From which it is effected, that he acknowledges God, who, as it
were, calls to mind the source from which he is sprung. Those philosophers, therefore, who
wish to free the mind from all fear, take away even religion, and thus deprive man of his
peculiar and surpassing good, which is distinct from living uprightly, and from everything
connected with man, because God, who made all living creatures subject to man, also made
man subject to Himself. What reason is there why they should also maintain that the mind
is to be turned in the same direction to which the countenance is raised? For if we must look
to the heaven, it is undoubtedly for no other reason than on account of religion; if religion
is taken away, we have nothing to do with the heaven. Therefore we must either look in that
direction or bend down to the earth. We are not able to bend down to the earth, even if we
<note type="footnote">399 The sounds uttered by the beasts, by which they are able to distinguish one another. [Rousseau’s theory
goes further.]</note>

<pb n="165"/>
should wish, since our posture is upright. We must therefore look up to the heaven, to which
the nature of the body calls us. And if it is admitted that this must be done, it must either
be done with this view, that we may devote ourselves to religion, or that we may know the
nature of the heavenly objects. But we cannot by any means know the nature of the heavenly
objects, because nothing of that kind can be found out by reflection, as I have before shown.
We must therefore devote ourselves to religion, and he who does not undertake this prostrates
himself to the ground, and, imitating the life of the brutes, abdicates the office of man.
Therefore the ignorant are more wise; for although they err in choosing religion, yet they
remember their own nature and condition.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="166"/>
<head>CHAP. XI.—OF RELIGION, WISDOM, AND THE CHIEF GOOD.</head>
<p>It is agreed upon, therefore, by the general consent of all mankind, that religion ought
to be undertaken; but we have to explain what errors are committed on this subject. God
willed this to be the nature of man, that he should be desirous and eager for two things, religion
and wisdom. But men are mistaken in this, that they either undertake religion and
pay no attention to wisdom, or they devote themselves to wisdom alone, and pay no attention
to religion, though the one cannot be true without the other. The consequence is, that they
fall into a multiplicity of religions, but false ones, because they have left wisdom, which
could have taught them that there cannot be many gods; or they devote themselves to wisdom,
but a false wisdom, because they have paid no attention to the religion of the Supreme God,
who might have instructed them to the knowledge of the truth. Thus men who undertake
either of these courses follow a devious path, and one full of the greatest errors, inasmuch
as the duty of man, and all truth, are included in these two things which are inseparably
connected. I wonder, therefore, that there was none at all of the philosophers who discovered
the abode and dwelling-place of the chief good. For they might have sought it in this manner.
Whatever the greatest good is, it must be an object proposed to all men. There is pleasure,
which is desired by all; but this is common also to man with the beasts, and has not the force
of the honourable, and brings a feeling of satiety, and when it is in excess is injurious, and
it is lessened by advance of age, and does not fall to the lot of many: for they who are without
resources, who constitute the greater part of men, must also be without pleasure. Therefore
pleasure is not the chief good; but it is not even a good. What shall we say of riches? This is
much more400 true of them. For they fall to the lot of fewer men, and that generally by
chance; and they often fall to the indolent, and sometimes by guilt, and they are desired by
those who already possess them. What shall we say of sovereignty itself? That does not
constitute the chief good: for all cannot reign, but it is necessary that all should be capable
of attaining the chief good.</p>
<p>Let us therefore seek something which is held forth to all. Is it virtue? It cannot be denied
that virtue is a good, and undoubtedly a good for all men. But if it cannot be happy because
its power and nature consist in the endurance of evil, it assuredly is not the chief good. Let
us seek something else. But nothing can be found more beautiful than virtue, nothing more
worthy of a wise man. For if vices are to be avoided on account of their deformity, virtue is
therefore to be desired on account of its beauty. What then? Can it be that that which is
admitted to be good and honourable should be requited with no reward, and be so unproductive
as to procure no advantage from itself? That great labour and difficulty and struggling
against evils with which this life is filled, must of necessity produce some great good. But
what shall we say that it is? Pleasure? But nothing that is base can arise from that which is
<note type="footnote">400 Multo magis is the reading of the mss.; but multo minus—“much less”—seems preferable.</note>

<pb n="167"/>
honourable. Shall we say that it is riches? or commands? But these things are frail and uncertain.
401 Is it glory? or honour? or a lasting name? But all these things are not contained
in virtue itself, but depend upon the opinion and judgment of others. For virtue is often
hated and visited with evil. But the good which arises from it ought to be so closely united
with it as to be incapable of being separated or disunited from it; and it cannot appear to be
the chief good in any other way than if it belongs peculiarly to virtue, and is such that
nothing can be added to it or taken from it. Why should I say that the duties of virtue consist
in the despising of all these things? For not to long for, or desire, or love pleasures, riches,
dominions, and honours, and all those things which are esteemed as goods, as others do
overpowered by desire, that assuredly is virtue. Therefore it effects something else more
sublime and excellent; nor does anything struggle against these present goods but that which
longs for greater and truer things. Let us not despair of being able to find it, if we turn our
thoughts in all directions; for no slight or trifling rewards are sought.</p>

<pb n="168"/>
<head>CHAP. XII.—OF THE TWOFOLD CONFLICT OF BODY AND SOUL; AND OF
DESIRING VIRTUE ON ACCOUNT OF ETERNAL LIFE.</head>
<p>But our inquiry is as to the object for which we are born: and thus we are able to trace
out what is the effect of virtue. There are two402 parts of which man is made up, soul and
body. There are many things peculiar to the soul, many peculiar to the body, many common
to both, as is virtue itself; and as often as this is referred to the body, it is called fortitude for
the sake of distinction. Since, therefore, fortitude is connected with each, a contest is proposed
to each, and victory held forth to each from the contest: the body, because it is solid, and
capable of being grasped, must contend with objects which are solid and can be grasped;
but the soul, on the other hand, because it is slight403 and subtle, and invisible, contends
with those enemies who cannot be seen and touched. But what are the enemies of the soul,
but lusts, vices, and sins? And if virtue shall have overcome and put to flight these, the soul
will be pure and free from stain. Whence, then, are we able to collect what are the effects of
fortitude of soul? Doubtless from that which is closely connected with it, and resembles it,
that is, from fortitude of the body; for when this has come to any encounter and contest,
what else does it seek from victory but life? For whether you contend with a man or beast,
the contest is for safety. Therefore, as the body obtains by victory its preservation from destruction,
so the soul obtains a continuation of its existence; and as the body, when overcome
by its enemies, suffers death, so the soul, when overpowered by vices, must die. What difference,
therefore, will there be between the contest carried on by the soul and that carried on
by the body, except that the body seeks for temporal, but the soul eternal life? If, therefore,
virtue is not happy by itself, since its whole force consists, as I have said, in the enduring of
evils; if it neglects all things which are desired as goods; if in its highest condition it is exposed
to death, inasmuch as it often refuses life, which is desired by others, and bravely undergoes
death, which others fear; if it must necessarily produce some great good from itself, because
labours, endured and overcome even until death, cannot fail of obtaining a reward; if no
reward, such as it deserves, is found on earth, inasmuch as it despises all things which are
frail and transitory, what else remains but that it may effect some heavenly reward, since it
treats with contempt all earthly things, and may aim at higher things, since it despises things
that are humble? And this reward can be nothing else but immortality.</p>
<p>With good reason, therefore, did Euclid, no obscure philosopher, who was the founder
of the system of the Megareans, differing from the others, say that that was the chief good
<note type="footnote">402 According to St. Paul, man consists of three parts—body, soul and spirit. Lactantius appears to use the
word soul in the same sense in which the Scriptures speak of spirit. [Vol. i. p. 532.]</note>
<note type="footnote">403 Tenuis, as applied to the soul, opposed to solidus, applied to the body.</note>

<pb n="169"/>
which was unvarying and always the same. He certainly understood what is the nature of
the chief good, although he did not explain in what it consisted; but it consists of immortality,
nor anything else at all, inasmuch as it alone is incapable of diminution, or increase, or
change. Seneca also unconsciously happened to confess that there is no other reward of
virtue than immortality. For in praising virtue in the treatise which he wrote on the subject
of premature death, he says: “Virtue is the only thing which can confer upon us immortality,
and make us equal to the gods.” But the Stoics also, whom he followed, say that no one can
be made happy without virtue. Therefore, the reward of virtue is a happy life, if virtue, as it
is rightly said, makes a happy life. Virtue, therefore, is not, as they say, to be sought on its
own account, but on account of a happy life, which necessarily follows virtue. And this argument
might have taught them in what the chief good consisted. But this present and
corporeal life cannot be happy, because it is subjected to evils through the body. Epicurus
calls God happy and incorruptible, because He is everlasting. For a state of happiness ought
to be perfect, so that there may be nothing which can harass, or lessen, or change it. Nor
can anything be judged happy in other respects, unless it be incorruptible. But nothing is
incorruptible but that which is immortal. Immortality therefore is alone happy, because it
can neither be corrupted nor destroyed. But if virtue falls within the power of man, which
no one can deny, happiness also belongs to him. For it is impossible for a man to be wretched
who is endued with virtue. If happiness falls within his power, then immortality, which is
possessed of the attribute of happiness, also belongs to him.</p>
<p>The chief good, therefore, is found to be immortality alone, which pertains to no other
animal or body; nor can it happen to any one without the virtue of knowledge, that is,
without the knowledge of God and justice. And how true and right is the seeking for this,
the very desire of this life shows: for although it be but temporary, and most full of labour,
yet it is sought and desired by all; for both old men and boys, kings and those of the lowest
station, in fine, wise as well as foolish, desire this. Of such value, as it seemed to Anaxagoras,
is the contemplation of the heaven and the light itself, that men willingly undergo any
miseries on this account. Since, therefore, this short and laborious life, by the general consent
not only of men, but also of other animals, is considered a great good, it is manifest that it
becomes also a very great and perfect good if it is without an end and free from all evil. In
short, there never would have been any one who would despise this life, however short it
is, or undergo death, unless through the hope of a longer life. For those who voluntarily
offered themselves to death for the safety of their countrymen, as Menoeceus did at Thebes,
Codrus at Athens, Curtius and the two Mures at Rome, would never have preferred death
to the advantages of life, unless they had thought that they should attain to immortality
through the estimation of their countrymen; and although they were ignorant of the life of
immortality, yet the reality itself did not escape their notice. For if virtue despises opulence
and riches because they are frail, and pleasures because they are of brief continuance, it

<pb n="170"/>
therefore despises a life which is frail and brief, that it may obtain one which is substantial
and lasting. Therefore reflection itself, advancing by regular order, and weighing everything,
leads us to that excellent and surpassing good, on account of which we are born. And if
philosophers had thus acted, if they had not preferred obstinately to maintain that which
they had once apprehended, they would undoubtedly have arrived at this truth, as I have
lately shown. And if this was not the part of those who extinguish the heavenly souls together
with the body, yet those who discuss the immortality of the soul ought to have understood
that virtue is set before us on this account, that, lusts having been subdued, and the desire
of earthly things overcome, our souls, pure and victorious, may return to God, that is, to
their original source. For it is on this account that we alone of living creatures are raised to
the sight of the heaven, that we may believe that our chief good is in the highest place.
Therefore we alone receive religion, that we may know from this source that the spirit of
man is not mortal, since it longs for and acknowledges God, who is immortal.</p>
<p>Therefore, of all the philosophers, those who have embraced either knowledge or virtue
as the chief good, have kept the way of truth, but have not arrived at perfection. For these
are the two things which together make up that which is sought for. Knowledge causes us
to know by what means and to what end we must attain; virtue causes us to attain to it. The
one without the other is of no avail; for from knowledge arises virtue, and from virtue the
chief good is produced. Therefore a happy life, which philosophers have always sought, and
still do seek, has no existence either in the worship of the gods or in philosophy; and on this
account they were unable to find it, because they did not seek the highest good in the highest
place, but in the lowest. For what is the highest but heaven, and God, from whom the soul
has its origin? And what is the lowest but the earth, from which the body is made? Therefore,
although some philosophers have assigned the chief good, not to the body, but to the soul,
yet, inasmuch as they have referred it to this life, which has its ending with the body, they
have gone back to the body, to which the whole of this time which is passed on earth has
reference. Therefore it was not without reason that they did not attain to the highest good;
for whatever looks to the body only, and is without immortality, must necessarily be the
lowest. Therefore happiness does not fall to the condition of man in that manner in which
philosophers thought; but it so falls to him, not that he should then be happy, when he lives
in the body, which must undoubtedly be corrupted in order to its dissolution; but then,
when, the soul being freed from intercourse with the body, he lives in the spirit only. In this
one thing alone can we be happy in this life, if we appear to be unhappy; if, avoiding the
enticements of pleasures, and giving ourselves to the service of virtue only, we live in all labours
and miseries, which are the means of exercising and strengthening virtue; if, in short,
we keep to that rugged and difficult path which has been opened for us to happiness. The
chief good therefore which makes men happy cannot exist, unless it be in that religion and
doctrine to which is annexed the hope of immortality.</p>

<pb n="171"/>
<head>CHAP. XIII.—OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AND OF WISDOM,
PHILOSOPHY, AND ELOQUENCE.</head>
<p>The subject seems to require in this place, that since we have taught that immortality
is the chief good, we should prove this also, that the soul is immortal. On which subject
there is great disputation among philosophers; nor have they who held true opinions respecting
the soul been able to explain or prove anything: for, being destitute of divine knowledge,
they neither brought forward true arguments by which they might overcome, nor evidence
by which they might convince. But we shall treat of this question more conveniently in the
last book, when we shall have to discuss the subject of a happy life. There remains that third
part of philosophy, which they call Logic, in which the whole subject of dialectics and the
whole method of speaking are contained. Divine learning does not stand in need of this,
because the seat of wisdom is not the tongue, but the heart; and it makes no difference what
kind of language you employ, for the question is not about words,404 but facts. And we are
not disputing about the grammarian or the orator, whose knowledge is concerned with the
proper manner of speaking, but about the wise man, whose learning is concerned with the
right manner of living. But if that system of natural philosophy before mentioned is not
necessary, nor this of logic, because they are not able to render a man happy, it remains that
the whole force of philosophy is contained in the ethical part alone, to which Socrates is
said to have applied himself, laying aside the others. And since I have shown that philosophers
erred in this part also, who did not grasp the chief good, for the sake of gaining which we
are born; it appears that philosophy is altogether false and empty, since it does not prepare
us for the duties of justice, nor strengthen the obligations and settled course of man’s life.
Let them know, therefore, that they are in error who imagine that philosophy is wisdom;
let them not be drawn away by the authority of any one; but rather let them incline to the
truth, and approach it. There is no room for rashness here; we must endure the punishment
of our folly to all eternity, if we shall be deceived either by an empty character or a false
opinion. But man,405 such as he is, if he trusts in himself, that is, if he trusts in man, is (not
to say foolish, in that he does not see his own error) undoubtedly arrogant, in venturing to
claim for himself that which the condition of man does not admit of.</p>
<p>And how much that greatest author of the Roman language is deceived, we may see
from that sentiment of his; for when, in his “Books on Offices,”406 he had said that philosophy
<note type="footnote">404 There is a memorable story related by ecclesiastical historians, about a very clever disputant, whose
sophistries could not be answered by his fellow-disputants, but who was completely silenced by the simple answers
of a Christian otherwise unknown. When questioned about his sudden silence, the sophist replied that others
exchanged words for words, but that this simple Christian fought with virtue.</note>
<note type="footnote">405 There seems to be a reference to a passage of Terence, in which the poet represents it as the property of
man to err. [Or to Cicero, rather: Cujusvis hominis est errare, etc. Philipp. xii. 2.]</note>
<note type="footnote">406 Cicero, De Officiis, ii. 2.</note>

<pb n="172"/>
is nothing else than the desire of wisdom, and that wisdom itself is the knowledge of things
divine and human, added: “And if any one censures the desire of this, I do not indeed understand
what there is which he imagines praiseworthy. For if enjoyment of the mind and
rest from cares is sought, what enjoyment can be compared with the pursuits of those who
are always inquiring into something which has reference to and tends to promote a good
and happy life? Or if any account is taken of consistency and virtue, either this is the study407
by which we may attain them, or there is none at all. To say that there is no system in connection
with the greatest subjects, when none of the least is without a system, is the part of
men speaking inconsiderately, and erring in the greatest subjects. But if there is any discipline
of virtue, where shall it be sought when you have departed from that kind of learning?” For
my own part, although I endeavoured to attain in some degree to the means of acquiring
learning, on account of my desire to teach others, yet I have never been eloquent, inasmuch
as I never even engaged in public speaking; but the goodness of the cause cannot fail of itself
to make me eloquent, and for its clear and copious defence the knowledge of divinity and
the truth itself are sufficient. I could wish, therefore, that Cicero might for a short time rise
from the dead, that a man of such consummate eloquence might be taught by an insignificant
person who is devoid of eloquence, first, what that is which is deemed worthy of praise by
him who blames that study which is called philosophy; and in the next place, that it is not
that study by which virtue and justice are learned, nor any other, as he thought; and lastly,
that since there is a discipline of virtue, he might be taught where it is to be sought, when
you have laid aside that kind of learning, which he did not seek for the sake of hearing and
learning. For from whom could he hear when no one knew it? But, as his usual practice was
in pleading causes, he wished to press his opponent by questioning, and thus to lead him to
confession, as though he were confident that no answer could be given to show that philosophy
was not the instructress of virtue. And in the Tusculan disputations he openly professed
this, turning his speech to philosophy, as though he was showing himself off by a declamatory
style of speaking. “O philosophy, thou guide of life,” he says; “O thou investigator of virtue,
and expeller of vices; what could not only we, but the life of men, have effected at all without
thee? Thou hast been the inventor of laws, thou the teacher of morals and discipline;”—as
though, indeed, she could perceive anything by herself, and he were not rather to be praised
who gave her. In the same manner he might have given thanks to food and drink, because
without these life could not exist; yet these, while they minister to sense, confer no benefit.
But as these things are the nourishment of the body, so wisdom is of the soul.</p>

HIMSELF, IN FIXING THE ORIGIN OF WISDOM.</head>
<p>Lucretius, accordingly, acts more correctly in praising him who was the first discoverer
of wisdom; but he acts foolishly in this, that he supposed it to be discovered by a man,—as
though that man whom he praises had found it lying somewhere as flutes at the fountain,408
according to the legends of the poets. But if he praised the inventor of wisdom as a god,—for
thus he speaks:409—
<lg>
<l>“No one, I think, who is formed of mortal body. For if we must speak, as the</l>
<l>acknowledged majesty of the subject itself demands, he was a god, he</l>
<l>was a god, most noble Memmius,”—</l>
</lg>
yet God ought not to have been praised on this account, because He discovered wisdom,
but because He created man, who might be capable of receiving wisdom. For he diminishes
the praise who praises a part only of the whole. But he praised Him as a man; whereas He
ought to have been esteemed as a God on this very account, because He found out wisdom.
For thus he speaks:410—
<lg>
<l>“Will it not be right that this man should be enrolled among the gods?”</l>
</lg>
From this it appears, either that he wished to praise Pythagoras, who was the first, as I have
said,411 to call himself a philosopher; or Thales of Miletus, who is reported to have been the
first who discussed the nature of things. Thus, while he seeks to exalt, he has depressed the
thing itself. For it is not great if it could have been discovered by man. But he may be
pardoned as a poet. But that same accomplished orator, that same consummate philosopher,
also censures the Greeks, whose levity he always accuses, and yet imitates. Wisdom itself,
which at one time he calls the gift, at another time the invention, of the gods, he fashions
after the manner of the poets, and praises on account of its beauty. He also grievously
complains that there have been some who disparaged it. “Can any one,” he says, “dare to
censure the parent of life, and to defile himself with this guilt of parricide, and to be so impiously
ungrateful?”</p>
<p>Are we then parricides, Marcus Tullius, and in your judgment worthy to be sewed412
up in a bag, who deny that philosophy is the parent of life? Or you, who are so impiously

ungrateful towards God (not this god whose image you worship as he sits in the Capitol,
but Him who made the world and created man, who bestowed wisdom also among His
heavenly benefits), do you call her the teacher of virtue or the parent of life, having learned413
from whom, one must be in much greater uncertainty than he was before? For of what virtue
is she the teacher? For philosophers to the present time do not explain where she is situated.
Of what life is she the parent? since the teachers themselves have been worn out by old age
and death before they have determined upon the befitting course of life. Of what truth can
you hold her forth as an explorer? since you often testify that, in so great a multitude of
philosophers, not a single wise man has yet existed. What, then, did that mistress of life
teach you? Was it to assail with reproaches the most powerful consul,414 and by your envenomed
speeches to render him the enemy of his country? But let us pass by those things,
which may be excused under the name of fortune. You applied yourself, in truth, to the
study of philosophy, and so, indeed, that no one ever applied himself more diligently; since
you were acquainted with all the systems of philosophy, as you yourself are accustomed to
boast, and elucidated the subject itself in Latin writings, and displayed yourself as an imitator
of Plato. Tell us, therefore, what you have learned, or in what sect you have discovered the
truth. Doubtless it was in the Academy which you followed and approved. But this teaches
nothing, excepting that you know your own ignorance.415 Therefore your own books refute
you, and show the nothingness of the learning which may be gained from philosophy for
life. These are your words: “But to me we appear not only blind to wisdom, but dull and
obtuse to those very things which may appear in some degree to be discerned.” If, therefore,
philosophy is the teacher of life, why did you appear to yourself blind, and dull, and obtuse?
whereas you ought, under her teaching, both to perceive and to be wise, and to be engaged
in the clearest light. But how you confessed the truth of philosophy we learn from the letters
addressed to your son, in which you advise him that the precepts of philosophy ought to be
known, but that we must live as members of a community.416</p>
<p>What can be spoken so contradictory? If the precepts of philosophy ought to be known,
it is on this account that they ought to be known, in order to our living well and wisely. Or
if we must live as members of a community, then philosophy is not wisdom, if it is better
to live in accordance with society than with philosophy. For if that which is called philosophy
be wisdom, he assuredly lives foolishly who does not live according to philosophy. But if he

does not live foolishly who lives in accordance with society, it follows that he who lives according
to philosophy lives foolishly. By your own judgment, therefore, philosophy is condemned
of folly and emptiness. And you also, in your Consolation, that is, not in a work of
levity and mirth, introduced this sentiment respecting philosophy: “But I know not what
error possesses us, or deplorable ignorance of the truth.” Where, then, is the guidance of
philosophy? or what has that parent of life taught you, if you are deplorably ignorant of the
truth? But if this confession of error and ignorance has been extorted almost against your
will from your innermost breast, why do you not at length acknowledge to yourself the
truth, that philosophy which, though it teaches nothing, you extolled with praises to the
heavens, cannot be the teacher of virtue?</p>

<head>CHAP. XV.—THE ERROR OF SENECA IN PHILOSOPHY, AND HOW THE SPEECH
OF PHILOSOPHERS IS AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR LIFE.</head>
<p>Under the influence of the same error (for who could keep the right course when Cicero
is in error?), Seneca said: “Philosophy is nothing else than the right method of living, or the
science of living honourably, or the art of passing a good life. We shall not err in saying that
philosophy is the law of living well and honourably. And he who spoke of it as a rule of life,
gave to it that which was its due.” He evidently did not refer to the common name of
philosophy; for, since this is diffused into many sects and systems, and has nothing certain—
nothing, in short, respecting which all agree with one mind and one voice,—what can
be so false as that philosophy should be called the rule of life, since the diversity of its precepts
hinders the right way and causes confusion? or the law of living well, when its subjects are
widely discordant? or the science of passing life, in which nothing else is effected by its repeated
contradictions than general417 uncertainty? For I ask whether he thinks that the
Academy is philosophy or not? I do not think that he will deny it. And if this is so, none of
these things, therefore, is in agreement with philosophy; which renders all things uncertain,
abrogates law, esteems art as nothing, subverts method, distorts rule, entirely takes away
knowledge. Therefore all those things are false, because they are inconsistent with a system
which is always uncertain, and up to this time explaining nothing. Therefore no system, or
science, or law of living well, has been established, except in this the only true and heavenly
wisdom, which had been unknown to philosophers. For that earthly wisdom, since it is false,
becomes varied and manifold, and altogether opposed to itself. And as there is but one
founder and ruler of the world, God, and as truth is one; so wisdom must be one and simple,
because, if anything is true and good, it cannot be perfect unless it is the only one of its kind.
But if philosophy were able to form the life, no others but philosophers would be good, and
all those who had not learned it would be always bad. But since there are, and always have
been, innumerable persons who are or have been good without any learning, but of philosophers
there has seldom been one who has done anything praiseworthy in his life; who is
there, I pray, who does not see that those men are not teachers of virtue, of which they
themselves are destitute? For if any one should diligently inquire into their character, he
will find that they are passionate, covetous, lustful, arrogant, wanton, and, concealing their
vices under a show of wisdom, doing those things at home which they had censured in the
schools.418</p>
<p>Perhaps I speak falsely for the sake of bringing an accusation. Does not Tullius both
acknowledge and complain of the same thing? “How few,” he says, “of philosophers are
found of such a character, so constituted in soul and life, as reason demands! how few who
<note type="footnote">417 Than—that no one knows anything.</note>
<note type="footnote">418 Sallust as a writer abounds in denunciations of vice. But see book ii. cap. 13, note 4, p. 62, supra.]</note>

<pb n="177"/>
think true instruction not a display of knowledge, but a law of life! how few who are obedient
to themselves, and submit to their own decrees! We may see some of such levity and ostentation,
that it would be better for them not to have learned at all; others eagerly desirous of
money, others of glory; many the slaves of lusts, so that their speech wonderfully disagrees
with their life.” Cornelius Nepos also writes to the same Cicero: “So far am I from thinking
that philosophy is the teacher of life and the completer of happiness, that I consider that
none have greater need of teachers of living than many who are engaged in the discussion
of this subject. For I see that a great part of those who give most elaborate precepts in their
school respect-modesty and self-restraint, live at the same time in the unrestrained desires
of all lusts.” Seneca also, in his Exhortations, says: “Many of the philosophers are of this description,
eloquent to their own condemnation: for if you should hear them arguing against
avarice, against lust and ambition, you would think that they were making a public disclosure419
of their own character, so entirely do the censures which they utter in public flow
back upon themselves; so that it is right to regard them in no other light than as physicians,
whose advertisements420 contain medicines, but their medicine chests poison. Some are
not ashamed of their vices; but they invent defences for their baseness, so that they may
appear even to sin with honour.” Seneca also says: “The wise man will even do things which
he will not approve of, that he may find means of passing to the accomplishment of greater
things; nor will he abandon good morals, but will adapt them to the occasion; and those
things which others employ for glory or pleasure, he will employ for the sake of action.”
Then he says shortly afterwards: “All things which the luxurious and the ignorant do, the
wise man also will do, but not in the same manner, and with the same purpose. But it makes
no difference with what intention you act, when the action itself is vicious; because acts are
seen, the intention is not seen.”</p>
<p>Aristippus, the master of the Cyrenaics, had a criminal intimacy with Lais, the celebrated
courtesan; and that grave teacher of philosophy defended this fault by saying, that there was
a great difference between him and the other lovers of Lais, because he himself possessed
Lais, whereas others were possessed by Lais. O illustrious wisdom, to be imitated by good
men! Would you, in truth, entrust your children to this man for education, that they might
learn to possess a harlot? He said that there was some difference between himself and the
dissolute, that they wasted their property, whereas he lived in indulgence without any cost.
And in this the harlot was plainly the wiser, who had the philosopher as her creature, that
all the youth, corrupted by the example and authority of the teacher, might flock together
to her without any shame. What difference therefore did it make, with what intention the
<note type="footnote">419 Indicium sui professos putes; others read judicium, “you would think that they were passing sentence
on themselves.”</note>
<note type="footnote">420 Tituli, “titles.”</note>

<pb n="178"/>
philosopher betook himself to that most notorious harlot, when the people and his rivals
saw him more depraved than all the abandoned? Nor was it enough to live in this manner,
but he began also to teach lusts; and he transferred his habits from the brothel to the school,
contending that bodily pleasure was the chief good. Which pernicious and shameful doctrine
has its origin not in the heart of the philosopher, but in the bosom of the harlot.</p>
<p>For why should I speak of the Cynics, who practised licentiousness in public? What
wonder if they derived their name and title from dogs,421 since they also imitated their life?
Therefore there is no instruction of virtue in this sect, since even those who enjoin more
honourable things either themselves do not practice what they advise; or if they do (which
rarely happens), it is not the system which leads them to that which is right, but nature
which often impels even the unlearned to praise.</p>
<note type="footnote">421 Augustine in many places expresses his opinion that the Cynics were so called from their immodesty.
Others suppose that the name was given to them on account of their snarling propensity.</note>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—THAT THE PHILOSOPHERS WHO GIVE GOOD INSTRUCTIONS
LIVE BADLY, BY THE TESTIMONY OF CICERO; THEREFORE WE SHOULD NOT
SO MUCH DEVOTE OURSELVES TO THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY AS TO
WISDOM.</head>
<p>But when they give themselves up to perpetual sloth, and undertake no exercise of virtue,
and pass their whole life in the practice of speaking, in what light ought they to be regarded
rather than as triflers? For wisdom, unless it is engaged on some action on which it may
exert its force, is empty and false; and Tullius rightly gives the preference, above teachers
of philosophy, to those men employed in civil affairs, who govern the state, who found new
cities or maintain with equity those already founded, who preserve the safety and liberty of
the citizens either by good laws or wholesome counsels, or by weighty judgments. For it is
right to make men good rather than to give precepts about duty to those shut up in corners,
which precepts are not observed even by those who speak them; and inasmuch as they have
withdrawn themselves from true actions, it is manifest that they invented the system of
philosophy itself, for the purpose of exercising the tongue, or for the sake of pleading. But
they who merely teach without acting, of themselves detract from the weight of their own
precepts; for who would obey, when they who give the precepts themselves teach disobedience?
Moreover, it is a good thing to give right and honourable precepts; but unless you
also practice them it is a deceit, and it is inconsistent and trifling to have goodness not in
the heart, but on the lips.</p>
<p>It is not therefore utility, but enjoyment, which they seek from philosophy. And this
Cicero indeed testified. “Truly,” he says, “all their disputation, although it contains most
abundant fountains of virtue and knowledge, yet, when compared with their actions and
accomplishments, I fear lest it should seem not to have brought so much advantage to the
business of men as enjoyment to their times of relaxation.” He ought not to have feared,
since he spoke the truth; but as if he were afraid lest he should be arraigned by the philosophers
on a charge of betraying a mystery, he did not venture confidently to pronounce that
which was true, that they do not dispute for the purpose of teaching, but for their own enjoyment
in their leisure; and since they are the advisers of actions, and do not themselves
act at all, they are to be regarded as mere talkers.422 But assuredly, because they contributed
no advantage to life, they neither obeyed their own decrees, nor has any one been found,
through so many ages, who lived in accordance with their laws. Therefore philosophy423
must altogether be laid aside, because we are not to devote ourselves to the pursuit of wisdom,
for this has no limit or moderation; but we must be wise, and that indeed quickly. For a
<note type="footnote">422 [See p. 83, note 2, and p. 84, note 1.]</note>
<note type="footnote">423 Lactantius must be understood as speaking of that kind of philosophy which teaches errors and deceits,
as St. Paul speaks, Col. ii. 8: “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit.”</note>

<pb n="180"/>
second life is not granted to us, so that when we seek wisdom in this life we may be wise in
that; each result must be brought about in this life. It ought to be quickly found, in order
that it may be quickly taken up, lest any part of life should pass away, the end of which is
uncertain. Hortensius in Cicero, contending against philosophy, is pressed by a clever argument;
inasmuch as, when he said that men ought not to philosophize, he seemed nevertheless
to philosophize, since it is the part of the philosophers to discuss what ought and what ought
not to be done in life. We are free and exempt from this calumny, who take away philosophy,
because it is the invention of human thought; we defend wisdom, because it is a divine tradition,
and we testify that it ought to be taken up by all. He, when he took away philosophy
without introducing anything better, was supposed to take away wisdom; and on that account
was more easily driven from his opinion, because it is agreed upon that man is not born to
folly, but to wisdom.</p>
<p>Moreover, the argument which the same Hortensius employed has great weight also
against philosophy,—namely, that it may be understood from this, that philosophy is not
wisdom, since its beginning and origin are apparent. When, he says, did philosophers begin
to exist? Thales, as I imagine, was the first, and his age was recent. Where, then, among the
more ancient men did that love of investigating the truth lie hid? Lucretius also says:424—
<lg>
<l>“Then, too, this nature and system of things has been discovered lately, and I</l>
<l>the very first of all have only now been found able to transfer it into</l>
<l>native words.”</l>
</lg>
And Seneca says: “There are not yet a thousand years since the beginnings of wisdom were
undertaken.” Therefore mankind for many generations lived without system. In ridicule of
which, Persius says:425—
<lg>
<l>“When wisdom came to the city,</l>
<l>Together with pepper and palms;”</l>
</lg>
as though wisdom had been introduced into the city together with savoury merchandise.426
For if it is in agreement with the nature of man, it must have had its commencement together
with man; but if it is not in agreement with it, human nature would be incapable of receiving
it. But, inasmuch as it has received it, it follows that wisdom has existed from the beginning:
therefore philosophy, inasmuch as it has not existed from the beginning, is not the same

<note type="footnote">426 [The force of the poet’s satire is in this petty merchandise.]</note>

<pb n="181"/>
true wisdom. But, in truth, the Greeks, because they had not attained to the sacred letters
of truth, did not know how wisdom was corrupted. And, therefore, since they thought that
human life was destitute of wisdom, they invented philosophy; that is, they wished by discussion
to tear up the truth which was lying hid and unknown to them: and this employment,
through ignorance of the truth, they thought to be wisdom.</p>

<pb n="182"/>
<head>CHAP. XVII.—HE PASSES FROM PHILOSOPHY TO THE PHILOSOPHERS,
BEGINNING WITH EPICURUS; AND HOW HE REGARDED LEUCIPPUS AND
DEMOCRITUS AS AUTHORS OF ERROR.</head>
<p>I have spoken on the subject of philosophy itself as briefly as I could; now let us come
to the philosophers, not that we may contend with these, who cannot maintain their ground,
but that we may pursue those who are in flight and driven from our battle-field. The system
of Epicurus was much more generally followed than those of the others; not because it brings
forward any truth, but because the attractive name of pleasure invites many.427 For every
one is naturally inclined to vices. Moreover, for the purpose of drawing the multitude to
himself, he speaks that which is specially adapted to each character separately. He forbids
the idle to apply himself to learning; he releases the covetous man from giving largesses to
the people; he prohibits the inactive man from undertaking the business of the state, the
sluggish from bodily exercise, the timid from military service. The irreligious is told that
the gods pay no attention to the conduct of men; the man who is unfeeling and selfish is
ordered to give nothing to any one, for that the wise man does everything on his own account.
To a man who avoids the crowd, solitude is praised. One who is too sparing, learns that life
can be sustained on water and meal. If a man hates his wife, the blessings of celibacy are
enumerated to him; to one who has bad children, the happiness of those who are without
children is proclaimed; against unnatural428 parents it is said that there is no bond of nature.
To the man who is delicate and incapable of endurance, it is said that pain is the greatest of
all evils; to the man of fortitude, it is said that the wise man is happy even under tortures.
The man who devotes himself to the pursuit of influence and distinction is enjoined to pay
court to kings; he who cannot endure annoyance is enjoined to shun the abode of kings.
Thus the crafty man collects an assembly from various and differing characters; and while
he lays himself out to please all, he is more at variance with himself than they all are with
one another. But we must explain from what source the whole of this system is derived, and
what origin it has.</p>
<p>Epicurus saw that the good are always subject to adversities, poverty, labours, exile, loss
of dear friends. On the contrary, he saw that the wicked were happy; that they were exalted
with influence, and loaded with honours; he saw that innocence was unprotected, that crimes
were committed with impunity: he saw that death raged without any regard to character,
without any arrangement or discrimination of age; but that some arrived at old age, while
others were carried off in their infancy; that some died when they were now robust and
<note type="footnote">427 [See Plato’s remark upon what he calls this disease, De Leg., x., finely expounded in Plato cont. Atheos
(note ix. p. 114) by Tayler Lewis.]</note>
<note type="footnote">428 There is another reading, “adversus parentes impio,” “to the son whose conduct to his parents is unnatural.”</note>

<pb n="183"/>
vigorous, that others were cut off by an untimely death in the first flower of youth; that in
wars the better men were especially overcome and slain. But that which especially moved
him, was the fact that religious men were especially visited with weightier evils, whereas he
saw that less evils or none at all fell upon those who altogether neglected the gods, or worshipped
them in an impious manner; and that even the very temples themselves were often
set on fire by lightning. And of this Lucretius complains,429 when he says respecting the
god:—
<lg>
<l>“Then he may hurl lightnings, and often throw down his temples, and withdraw-</l>
<l>ing into the deserts, there spend his rage in practising his bolt, which</l>
<l>often passes the guilty by, and strikes dead the innocent and unoffend-</l>
<l>ing.”</l>
</lg>
But if he had been able to collect even a small particle of truth, he would never say that the
god throws down his own temples, when he throws them down on this account, because
they are not his. The Capitol, which is the chief seat of the Roman city and religion, was
struck with lightning and set on fire not once only, but frequently. But what was the opinion
of clever men respecting this is evident from the saying of Cicero, who says that the flame
came from heaven, not to destroy that earthly dwelling-place of Jupiter, but to demand a
loftier and more magnificent abode. Concerning which transaction, in the books respecting
his consulship, he speaks to the same purport as Lucretius:—
<lg>
<l>“For the father thundering on high, throned in the lofty Olympus, himself assailed</l>
<l>his own citadels and famed temples, and cast fires upon his abode in</l>
<l>the Capitol.</l>
</lg>
In the obstinacy of their folly, therefore, they not only did not understand the power and
majesty of the true God, but they even increased the impiety of their error, in endeavouring
against all divine law to restore a temple so often condemned by the judgment of Heaven.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Epicurus reflected on these things, induced as it were by the injustice
of these matters (for thus it appeared to him in his ignorance of the cause and subject), he
thought that there was no providence.430 And having persuaded himself of this, he undertook
also to defend it, and thus he entangled himself in inextricable errors. For if there is no
<note type="footnote">429 Lucretius, De Rerum Natura, ii. 1101, Munro.</note>
<note type="footnote">430 [This age is favoured with a reproduction of these absurdities; and what has happened in consequence
before, will be repeated now.]</note>

<pb n="184"/>
providence, how is it that the world was made with such order and arrangement? He says:
There is no arrangement, for many things are made in a different manner from that in which
they ought to have been made. And the divine man found subjects of censure. Now, if I had
leisure to refute these things separately, I could easily show that this man was neither wise
nor of sound mind. Also, if there is no providence, how is it that the bodies of animals are
arranged with such foresight, that the various members, being disposed in a wonderful
manner, discharge their own offices individually? The system of providence, he says, contrived
nothing in the production of animals; for neither were the eyes made for seeing, nor
the ears for hearing, nor the tongue for speaking, nor the feet for walking; inasmuch as these
were produced before it was possible to speak, to hear, to see, and to walk. Therefore these
were not produced for use; but use was produced from them. If there is no providence, why
do rains fall, fruits spring up, and trees put forth leaves? These things, he says, are not always
done for the sake of living creatures, inasmuch as they are of no benefit to providence; but
all things must be produced of their own accord. From what source, therefore, do they
arise,431 or how are all things which are carried on brought about? There is no need, he says,
of supposing a providence; for there are seeds floating through the empty void, and from
these, collected together without order, all things are produced and take their form. Why,
then, do we not perceive or distinguish them? Because, he says, they have neither any colour,
nor warmth, nor smell; they are also without flavour and moisture; and they are so minute,
that they cannot be cut and divided.</p>
<p>Thus, because he had taken up a false principle at the commencement, the necessity of
the subjects which followed led him to absurdities. For where or from whence are these
atoms? Why did no one dream of them besides Leucippus only? from whom Democritus,432
having received instructions, left to Epicurus the inheritance of his folly. And if these are
minute bodies, and indeed solid, as they say, they certainly are able to fall under the notice
of the eyes. If the nature of all things is the same, how is it that they compose various objects?
They meet together, he says, in varied order and position as the letters which, though few
in number, by variety of arrangement make up innumerable words. But it is urged the letters
have a variety of forms. And so, he says, have these first principles; for they are rough, they
are furnished with hooks, they are smooth. Therefore they can be cut and divided, if there
is in them any part which projects. But if they are smooth and without hooks, they cannot
cohere. They ought therefore to he hooked, that they may be linked together one with another.
But since they are said to be so minute that they cannot be cut asunder by the edge
of any weapon, how is it that they have hooks or angles? For it must be possible for these
to be torn asunder, since they project. In the next place, by what mutual compact, by what
<note type="footnote">431 See Lucretius, book ii.</note>
<note type="footnote">432 [See vol. ii. p. 465, the whole of 14th chapter.]</note>

<pb n="185"/>
discernment, do they meet together, so that anything may be constructed out of them? If
they are without intelligence, they cannot come together in such order and arrangement;
for nothing but reason can bring to accomplishment anything in accordance with reason.
With how many arguments can this trifling be refuted! But I must proceed with my subject.
This is he
<lg>
<l>“Who surpassed in intellect the race of man, and quenched the light of all, as the</l>
<l>ethereal sun arisen quenches the stars.”433</l>
</lg>
Which verses I am never able to read without laughter. For this was not said respecting
Socrates or Plato, who are esteemed as kings of philosophers, but concerning a man who,
though of sound mind and vigorous health, raved more senselessly than any one diseased.
And thus the most vain poet, I do not say adorned, but overwhelmed and crushed, the mouse
with the praises of the lion. But the same man also releases us from the fear of death, respecting
which these are his own exact words:—
<lg>
<l>“When we are in existence, death does not exist; when death exists, we have no</l>
<l>existence: therefore death is nothing to us.”</l>
</lg>
How cleverly he has deceived us! As though it were death now completed which is an object
of fear, by which sensation has been already taken away, and not the very act of dying, by
which sensation is being taken from us. For there is a time in which we ourselves even yet434
exist, and death does not yet exist; and that very time appears to be miserable, because death
is beginning to exist, and we are ceasing to exist.</p>
<p>Nor is it said without reason that death is not miserable. The approach of death is
miserable; that is, to waste away by disease, to endure the thrust, to receive the weapon in
the body, to be burnt with fire, to be torn by the teeth of beasts. These are the things which
are feared, not because they bring death, but because they bring great pain. But rather make
out that pain is not an evil. He says it is the greatest of all evils. How therefore can I fail to
fear, if that which precedes or brings about death is an evil? Why should I say that the argument
is false, inasmuch as souls do not perish? But, he says, souls do perish; for that which
is born with the body must perish with the body. I have already stated that I prefer to put
off the discussion of this subject, and to reserve it for the last part of my work, that I may
refute this persuasion of Epicurus, whether it was that of Democritus or Dicæarchus, both

<note type="footnote">434 The reading of the text, which appears to be the true one, is “quo nos etiamnum sumus.” There is another

which is totally opposed to the view taken by Lactantius.</note>

by arguments and divine testimonies. But perhaps he promised himself impunity in the indulgence
of his vices; for he was an advocate of most disgraceful pleasure, and said that man
was born for its enjoyment.435 Who, when he hears this affirmed, would abstain from the
practice of vice and wickedness? For; if the soul is doomed to perish, let us eagerly pursue
riches, that we may be able to enjoy all kinds of indulgence; and if these are wanting to us,
let us take them away from those who have them by stealth, by stratagem, or by force, especially
if there is no God who regards the actions of men: as long as the hope of impunity
shall favour us, let us plunder and put to death.436 For it is the part of the wise man to do
evil, if it is advantageous to him, and safe; since, if there is a God in heaven, He is not angry
with any one. It is also equally the part of the foolish man to do good; because, as he is not
excited with anger, so he is not influenced by favour. Therefore let us live in the indulgence
of pleasures in every possible way; for in a short time we shall not exist at all. Therefore let
us suffer no day, in short, no moment of time, to pass away from us without pleasure; lest,
since we ourselves are doomed to perish, the life which we have already spent should itself
also perish.</p>
<p>Although he does not say this in word, yet he teaches it in fact. For when he maintains
that the wise man does everything for his own sake, he refers all things which he does to his
own advantage. And thus he who hears these disgraceful things, will neither think that any
good thing ought to be done, since the conferring of benefits has reference to the advantage
of another; nor that he ought to abstain from guilt, because the doing of evil is attended
with gain. If any chieftain of pirates or leader of robbers were exhorting his men to acts of
violence, what other language could he employ than to say the same things which Epicurus
says: that the gods take no notice; that they are not affected with anger nor kind feeling; that
the punishment of a future state is not to be dreaded, because souls die after death, and that
there is no future state of punishment at all; that pleasure is the greatest good; that there is
no society among men; that every one consults for his own interest; that there is no one who
loves another, unless it be for his own sake; that death is not to be feared by a brave man,
nor any pain; for that he, even if he should be tortured or burnt, should say that he does not
regard it. There is evidently sufficient cause why any one should regard this as the expression
of a wise man, since it can most fittingly be applied to robbers!</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—THE PYTHAGOREANS AND STOICS, WHILE THEY HOLD THE
IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, FOOLISHLY PERSUADE A VOLUNTARY DEATH.</head>
<p>Others, again, discuss things contrary to these, namely, that the soul survives after death;
and these are chiefly the Pythagoreans and Stoics. And although they are to be treated with
indulgence because they perceive the truth, yet I cannot but blame them, because they fell
upon the truth not by their opinion, but by accident. And thus they erred in some degree
even in that very matter which they rightly perceived. For, since they feared the argument
by which it is inferred that the soul must necessarily die with the body, because it is born
with the body, they asserted that the soul is not born with the body, but rather introduced
into it, and that it migrates from one body to another. They did not consider that it was
possible for the soul to survive the body, unless it should appear to have existed previously
to the body. There is therefore an equal and almost similar error on each side. But the one
side are deceived with respect to the past, the other with respect to the future. For no one
saw that which is most true, that the soul is both created and does not die, because they were
ignorant why that came to pass, or what was the nature of man. Many therefore of them,
because they suspected that the soul is immortal, laid violent hands upon themselves, as
though they were about to depart to heaven. Thus it was with Cleanthes437 and
Chrysippus,438 with Zeno,439 and Empedocles,440 who in the dead of night cast himself
into a cavity of the burning Ætna, that when he had suddenly disappeared it might be believed
that he had departed to the gods; and thus also of the Romans Cato died, who through the
whole of his life was an imitator of Socratic ostentation. For Democritus441 was of another
persuasion. But, however,
<lg>
<l>“By his own spontaneous act he offered up his head to death; “442</l>
</lg>
and nothing can be more wicked than this. For if a homicide is guilty because he is a destroyer
of man, he who puts himself to death is under the same guilt, because he puts to death a
man. Yea, that crime may be considered to be greater, the punishment of which belongs to
God alone. For as we did not come into this life of our own accord; so, on the other hand,
<note type="footnote">437 Cleanthes was a Stoic philosopher, who used to draw water by night for his support, that he might devote
himself to the study of philosophy by day. He ended his life by refusing to take food.</note>
<note type="footnote">438 Chrysippus was a disciple of Zeno, and, after Cleanthes, the chief of the Stoic sect. According to some
accounts, he died front an excessive draught of wine; according to others, from excessive laughter.</note>
<note type="footnote">439 Zeno, the chief of the Stoic sect. He is said to have died from suffocation.</note>
<note type="footnote">440 Empedocles was a philosopher and poet. There are various accounts of his death; that mentioned in the
text is usually received.</note>

we can only withdraw from this habitation of the body which has been appointed for us to
keep, by the command of Him who placed us in this body that we may inhabit it, until He
orders us to depart from it; and if any violence is offered to us, we must endure it with
equanimity, since the death of an innocent person cannot be unavenged, and since we have
a great Judge who alone always has the power of taking vengeance in His hands.</p>
<p>All these philosophers, therefore, were homicides; and Cato himself, the chief of Roman
wisdom, who, before he put himself to death, is said to have read through the treatise of
Plato which he wrote on the immortality of the soul, and was led by the authority of the
philosopher to the commission of this great crime; yet he, however, appears to have had
some cause for death in his hatred of slavery. Why should I speak of the Ambraciot,443 who,
having read the same treatise, threw himself into the sea, for no other cause than that he
believed Plato?—a doctrine altogether detestable and to be avoided, if it drives men from
life. But if Plato had known and taught by whom, and how, and to whom, and on account
of what actions, and at what time, immortality is given, he would neither have driven
Cleombrotus nor Cato to a voluntary death, but he would have trained them to live with
justice. For it appears to me that Cato sought a cause for death, not so much that he might
escape from Cæsar, as that he might obey the decrees of the Stoics, whom he followed, and
might make his name distinguished by some great action; and I do not see what evil could
have happened to him if he had lived. For Caius Cæsar, such was his clemency, had no
other object, even in the very heat of civil war, than to appear to deserve well of the state,
by preserving two excellent citizens, Cicero and Cato. But let us return to those who praise
death as a benefit. You complain of life as though you had lived, or had ever settled with
yourself why you were born at all. May not therefore the true and common Father of all
justly find fault with that saying of Terence:444—
<lg>
<l>“First, learn in what life consists; then, if you shall be dissatisfied with life, have
recourse to death.”</l>
</lg>
You are indignant that you are exposed to evils; as though you deserved anything good,
who are ignorant of your Father, Lord, and King; who, although you behold with your eyes
the bright light, are nevertheless blind in mind, and lie in the depths of the darkness of ignorance.
And this ignorance has caused that some have not been ashamed to say, that we
are born for this cause, that we may suffer the punishment of our crimes; but I do not see
what can be more senseless than this. For where or what crimes could we have committed

when we did not even exist? Unless we shall happen to believe that foolish old man,445 who
falsely said that he had lived before, and that in his former life he had been Euphorbus. He,
I believe, because he was born of an ignoble race, chose for himself a family from the poems
of Homer. O wonderful and remarkable memory of Pythagoras! O miserable forgetfulness
on the part of us all, since we know not who we were in our former life! But perhaps it was
caused by some error, or favour, that he alone did not touch the abyss of Lethe, or taste the
water of oblivion; doubtless the trifling old man (as is wont to be the case with old women
who are free from occupation) invented fables as it were for credulous infants. But if he had
thought well of those to whom he spoke these things; if he had considered them to be men,
he would never have claimed to himself the liberty of uttering such perverse falsehoods. But
the folly of this most trifling man is deserving of ridicule. What shall we do in the case of
Cicero, who, having said in the beginning of his Consolation that men were born for the
sake of atoning for their crimes, afterwards repeated the assertion, as though rebuking him
who does not imagine that life is a punishment? He was right, therefore, in saying beforehand
that he was held by error and wretched ignorance of the truth.</p>
<note type="footnote">445 Pythagoras taught the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and affirmed that he had lived already as
Euphorbus, one of the heroes of Troy, who was slain by Menelaus in the Trojan war. Lactantius again refers to

<head>CHAP. XIX.—CICERO AND OTHERS OF THE WISEST MEN TEACH THE
IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, BUT IN AN UNBELIEVING MANNER; AND THAT
A GOOD OR AN EVIL DEATH MUST BE WEIGHED FROM THE PREVIOUS LIFE.</head>
<p>But those who assert the advantage of death, because they know nothing of the truth,
thus reason: If there is nothing after death, death is not an evil; for it takes away the perception
of evil. But if the soul survives, death is even an advantage; because immortality follows.
And this sentiment is thus set forth by Cicero concerning the Laws:446 “We may congratulate
ourselves, since death is about to bring either a better state than that which exists in life, or
at any rate not a worse. For if the soul is in a state of vigour without the body, it is a divine
life; and if it is without perception, assuredly there is no evil.” Cleverly argued, as it appeared
to himself, as though there could be no other state. But each conclusion is false. For the
sacred writings447 teach that the soul is not annihilated; but that it is either rewarded according
to its righteousness, or eternally punished according to its crimes. For neither is it right,
that he who has lived a life of wickedness in prosperity should escape the punishment which
he deserves; nor that he who has been wretched on account of his righteousness, should be
deprived of his reward. And this is so true, that Tully also, in his Consolation, declared that
the righteous and the wicked do not inhabit the same abodes. For those same wise men, he
says, did not judge that the same course was open for all into the heaven; for they taught
that those who were contaminated by vices and crimes were thrust down into darkness, and
lay in the mire; but that, on the other hand, souls that were chaste, pure, upright, and uncontaminated,
being also refined by the study and practice of virtue, by a light and easy course
take their flight to the gods, that is, to a nature resembling their own. But this sentiment is
opposed to the former argument. For that is based on the assumption that every man at his
birth is presented with immortality. What distinction, therefore, will there be between virtue
and guilt, if it makes no difference whether a man be Aristides or Phalaris, whether he be
Cato or Catiline? But a man does not perceive this opposition between sentiments and actions,
unless he is in possession of the truth. If any one, therefore, should ask me whether
death is a good or an evil, I shall reply that its character depends upon the course of the life.
For as life itself is a good if it is passed virtuously, but an evil if it is spent viciously, so also
death is to be weighed in accordance with the past actions of life. And so it comes to pass,
that if life has been passed in the service of God, death is not an evil, for it is a translation
to immortality. But if not so, death must necessarily be an evil, since it transfers men, as I
have said, to everlasting punishment.448</p>
<note type="footnote">446 This passage is not contained in Cicero’s treatise on the Laws, but the substance of it is in the Tusculan
Questions</note>
<note type="footnote">447 See Dan. xii.; Matt. iii., xiii., xxv.; John xii.</note>
<note type="footnote">448 [See vol. iii. p. 231, and same treatise sparsim ]</note>

<pb n="191"/>
<p>What, then, shall we say, but that they are in error who either desire death as a good,
or flee from life as an evil? unless they are most unjust, who do not weigh the fewer evils
against the greater number of blessings. For when they pass all their lives in a variety of the
choicest gratifications, if any bitterness has chanced to succeed to these, they desire to die;
and they so regard it as to appear never to have fared well, if at any time they happen to fare
ill. Therefore they condemn the whole of life, and consider it as nothing else than filled with
evils. Hence arose that foolish sentiment, that this state which we imagine to be life is death,
and that that which we fear as death is life; and so that the first good is not to be born, that
the second is an early death. And that this sentiment may be of greater weight, it is attributed
to Silenus.449 Cicero in his Consolation says: “Not to be born is by far the best thing, and
not to fall upon these rocks of life. But the next thing is, if you have been born, to die as
soon as possible, and to flee from the violence of fortune as from a conflagration.” That he
believed this most foolish expression appears from this, that he added something of his own
for its embellishment. I ask, therefore, for whom he thinks it best not to be born, when there
is no one at all who has any perception; for it is the perception which causes anything to be
good or bad. In the next place, why did he regard the whole of life as nothing else than rocks,
and a conflagration; as though it were either in our power not to be born, or life were given
to us by fortune, and not by God, or as though the course of life appeared to bear any resemblance
to a conflagration?</p>
<p>The saying of Plato is not dissimilar, that he gave thanks to nature, first that he was born
a human being rather than a dumb animal; in the next place, that he was a man rather than
a woman; that he was a Greek rather than a barbarian;450 lastly, that he was an Athenian,
and that he was born in the time of Socrates. It is impossible to say what great blindness
and errors are produced by ignorance of the truth would altogether contend that nothing
in the affairs of men was ever spoken more foolishly. As though, if he had been born a barbarian,
or a woman, or, in fine, an ass, he would be the same Plato, and not that very being
which had been produced. But he evidently believed Pythagoras, who, in order that he might
prevent men from feeding on animals, said that souls passed from the bodies of men to the
bodies of other animals; which is both foolish and impossible. It is foolish, because it was
unnecessary to introduce souls that have long existed into new bodies, when the same Artificer
who at one time had made the first, was always able to make fresh ones; it is impossible,
because the soul endued with right reason can no more change the nature of its condition,
than fire can rush downwards, or, like a river, pour its flame obliquely.451 The wise man
<note type="footnote">449 Silenus was the constant companion of Dionysus. He was regarded as an inspired prophet, who knew
all the past and the most distant future, and as a sage who despised all the gifts of fortune.</note>
<note type="footnote">450 The Greeks included all nations, except themselves, under the general name of barbarians.</note>
<note type="footnote">451 In transversum, “crosswise or transversely.”</note>

<pb n="192"/>
therefore imagined, that it might come to pass that the soul which was then in Plato might
be shut up in some other animal, and might be endued with the sensibility of a man, so as
to understand and grieve that it was burthened with an incongruous body. How much more
rationally would he have acted, if he had said that he gave thanks because he was born with
a good capacity, and capable of receiving instruction, and that he was possessed of those
resources which enabled him to receive a liberal education! For what benefit was it that he
was born at Athens? Have not many men of distinguished talent and learning lived in other
cities, who were better individually than all the Athenians? How many thousands must we
believe that there were, who, though born at Athens, and in the times of Socrates, were
nevertheless unlearned and foolish? For it is not the walls or the place in which any one was
born that can invest a man with wisdom. Of what avail was it to congratulate himself that
he was born in the times of Socrates? Was Socrates able to supply talent to learners? It did
not occur to Plato that Alcibiades also, and Critias, were constant hearers of the same
Socrates, the one of whom was the most active enemy of his country, the other the most
cruel of all tyrants.</p>

<pb n="193"/>
<head>CHAP. XX.—SOCRATES HAD MORE KNOWLEDGE IN PHILOSOPHY THAN OTHER
MEN, ALTHOUGH IN MANY THINGS HE ACTED FOOLISHLY.</head>
<p>Let us now see what there was so great in Socrates himself, that a wise man deservedly
gave thanks that he was born in his times. I do not deny that he was a little more sagacious
than the others who thought that the nature of things could be comprehended by the mind.
And in this I judge that they were not only senseless, but also impious; because they wished
to send their inquisitive eyes into the secrets of that heavenly providence. We know that
there are at Rome, and in many cities, certain sacred things which it is considered impious
for men to look upon. Therefore they who are not permitted to pollute those objects abstain
from looking upon them; and if by error or some accident a man has happened to see them,
his guilt is expiated first by his punishment, and afterwards by a repetition of sacrifice. What
can you do in the case of those who wish to pry into unpermitted things? Truly they are
much more wicked who seek to profane the secrets of the world and this heavenly temple
with impious disputations, than those who entered the temple of Vesta, or the Good Goddess,
or Ceres. And these shrines, though it is not lawful for men to approach them, were yet
constructed by men. But these men not only escape the charge of impiety, but, that which
is much more unbecoming, they gain the fame of eloquence and the glory of talent. What
if they were able to investigate anything? For they are as foolish in asserting as they are
wicked in searching out; since they are neither able to find out anything, nor, even if they
had found out anything, to defend it. For if even by chance they have seen the truth—a thing
which often happens—they so act that it is refuted by others as false. For no one descends
from heaven to pass sentence on the opinions of individuals; wherefore no one can doubt
that those who seek after these things are foolish, senseless, and insane.</p>
<p>Socrates therefore had something of human wisdom,452 who, when he understood that
these things could not possibly be ascertained, removed himself from questions of this kind;
but I fear that he so acted in this alone. For many of his actions are not only undeserving of
praise, but also most deserving of censure, in which things he most resembled those of his
own class. Out of these I will select one which may be judged of by all. Socrates used this
well-known proverb: “That which is above us is nothing to us.” Let us therefore fall down
upon the earth, and use as feet those hands which have been given us for the production of
excellent works. The heaven is nothing to us, to the contemplation of which we have been
raised;453 in fine, the light itself can have no reference to us; undoubtedly the cause of our
sustenance is from heaven. But if he perceived this, that we ought not to discuss the nature
of heavenly things, he was unable even to comprehend the nature of those things which he
<note type="footnote">452 Lactantius here uses cor, “the heart,” for wisdom, regarding the heart as the seat of wisdom.</note>
<note type="footnote">453 The allusion is to the upright figure of man, as opposed to the other animals, which look down upon the
earth, whereas man looks upward. [Our author is partial to this idea. See p. 41, supra.]</note>

<pb n="194"/>
had beneath his feet. What then? did he err in his words? It is not probable; but he undoubtedly
meant that which he said, that we are not to devote ourselves to religion; but if
he were openly to say this, no one would suffer it.</p>
<p>For who cannot perceive that this world, completed with such wonderful method, is
governed by some providence, since there is nothing which can exist without some one to
direct it? Thus, a house deserted by its inhabitant fails to decay; a ship without a pilot goes
to the bottom; and a body abandoned by the soul wastes away. Much less can we suppose
that so great a fabric could either have been constructed without an Artificer, or have existed
so long without a Ruler. But if he wished to overthrow those public superstitions, I do not
disapprove of this; yea, I shall rather praise it, if he shall have found anything better to take
their place. But the same man swore454 by a dog and a goose. Oh buffoon (as Zeno the
Epicurean455 says), senseless, abandoned, desperate man, if he wished to scoff at religion;
madman, if he did this seriously, so as to esteem a most base animal as God! For who can
dare to find fault with the superstitions of the Egyptians, when Socrates confirmed them at
Athens by his authority? But was it not a mark of consummate vanity, that before his death
he asked his friends to sacrifice for him a cock which he had vowed to Æsculapius? He
evidently feared lest he should be put upon his trial before Rhadamanthus, the judge, by
Æsculapius on account of the vow. I should consider him most mad if he had died under
the influence of disease. But since he did this in his sound mind, he who thinks that he was
wise is himself of unsound mind. Behold one in whose times the wise man congratulates
himself as having been born!</p>
<note type="footnote">454 This oath is mentioned by Athenæus. Tertullian makes an excuse for it, as though it were done in
mockery of the gods. Socrates was called the Athenian buffoon, because he taught many things in a jesting
manner.</note>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF THE SYSTEM OF PLATO, WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE
OVERTHROW OF STATES.</head>
<p>Let us, however, see what it was that he learned from Socrates, who, having entirely rejected
natural philosophy, betook himself to inquiries about virtue and duty. And thus I do
not doubt that he instructed his hearers in the precepts of justice. Therefore, under the
teaching of Socrates, it did not escape the notice of Plato, that the force of justice consists
in equality, since all are born in an equal condition. Therefore (he says) they must have
nothing private or their own; but that they may be equal, as the method of justice requires,
they must possess all things in common. This is capable of being endured, as long as it appears
to be spoken of money. But how impossible and how unjust this is, I could show by many
things. Let us, however, admit its possibility. For grant that all are wise, and despise money.
To what, then, did that community lead him? Marriages also, be says, ought to be in common;
so that many men may flock together like dogs to the same woman, and he who shall be
superior in strength may succeed in obtaining her; or if they are patient as philosophers,
they may await their turns, as in a brothel. Oh the wonderful equality of Plato! Where, then,
is the virtue of chastity? where conjugal fidelity? And if you take away these, all justice is
taken away. But he also says that states would be prosperous, if either philosophers were
their kings, or their kings were philosophers. But if you were to give the sovereignty to this
man of such justice and equity, who had deprived some of their own property, and given
to some the property of others, he would prostitute the modesty of women; a thing which
was never done, I do not say by a king, but not even by a tyrant.</p>
<p>But what motive did he advance for this most degrading advice? The state will be in
harmony, and bound together with the bonds of mutual love, if all shall be the husbands,
and fathers, and wives, and children of all. What a confusion of the human race is this? How
is it possible for affection to be preserved where there is nothing certain to be loved? What
man will love a woman, or what woman a man, unless they shall always have lived together,—
unless devotedness of mind, and faith mutually preserved, shall have made their love
indivisible? But this virtue has no place in that promiscuous pleasure. Moreover, if all are
the children of all, who will be able to love children as his own, when he is either ignorant
or in doubt whether they are his own? Who will bestow honour upon any one as a father,
when he does not know from whom he was born? From which it comes to pass, that he not
only esteems a stranger as a father, but also a father as a stranger. Why should I say that it
is possible for a wife to be common, but impossible for a son, who cannot be conceived except
from one? The community, therefore, is lost to him alone, nature herself crying out against
it. It remains that it is only for the sake of concord that he would have a community of wives.
But there is no more vehement cause of discords, than the desire of one woman by many
men. And in this Plato might have been admonished, if not by reason, yet certainly by example,
both of the dumb animals, which fight most vehemently on this account, and of

<pb n="196"/>
men, who have always carried on most severe wars with one another on account of this
matter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">
<pb n="197"/>
<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF THE PRECEPTS OF PLATO, AND CENSURES OF THE SAME.</head>
<p>It remains that the community of which we have spoken admits of nothing else but
adulteries and lusts, for the utter extinction of which virtue is especially necessary. Therefore
he did not find the concord which he sought, because he did not see whence it arises. For
justice has no weight in outward circumstances, not even in the body,456 but it is altogether
employed on the mind of man. He, therefore, who wishes to place men on an equality, ought
not to take away marriage and wealth, but arrogance, pride, and haughtiness, that those
who are powerful and lifted up on high may know that they are on a level even with the
most needy. For insolence and injustice being taken from the rich, it will make no difference
whether some are rich and others poor, since they will be equal in spirit, and nothing but
reverence towards God can produce this result. He thought, therefore, that he had found
justice, whereas he had altogether removed it, because it ought not to be a community of
perishable things, but of minds. For if justice is the mother457 of all virtues, when they are
severally taken away, it is also itself overthrown. But Plato took away above all things
frugality, which has no existence when there is no property of one’s own which can be possessed;
he took away abstinence, since there will be nothing belonging to another from which
one can abstain; he took away temperance and chastity, which are the greatest virtues in
each sex; he took away self-respect, shame, and modesty, if those things which are accustomed
to be judged base and disgraceful begin to be accounted honourable and lawful. Thus, while
he wishes to confer virtue upon all, he takes it away from all. For the ownership of property
contains the material both of vices and of virtues, but a community of goods contains
nothing else than the licentiousness of vices. For men who have many mistresses can be
called nothing else than luxurious and prodigal. And likewise women who are in the possession
of many men, must of necessity be not adulteresses, because they have no fixed marriage,
but prostitutes and harlots. Therefore he reduced human life, I do not say to the likeness of
dumb animals, but of the herds and brutes. For almost all the birds contract marriages, and
are united in pairs, and defend their nests, as though their marriage-beds, with harmonious
mind, and cherish their own young, because they are well known to them; and if you put
others in their way, they repel them. But this wise man, contrary to the custom of men, and
contrary to nature, chose more foolish objects of imitation; and since he saw that the duties
of males and females were not separated in the case of other animals, he thought that women
also ought to engage in warfare, and take a share in the public counsels, and undertake
magistracies, and assume commands. And therefore he assigned to them horses and arms:
it follows that he should have assigned to men wool and the loom, and the carrying of infants.

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE ERRORS OF CERTAIN PHILOSOPHERS, AND OF THE SUN
AND MOON.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, the leading men among the philosophers are themselves discovered to
be of such emptiness, what shall we think of those lesser459 ones, who are accustomed never
to appear to themselves so wise, as when they boast of their contempt of money? Brave
spirit! But I wait to see their conduct, and what are the results of that contempt. They avoid
as an evil, and abandon the property handed down to them from their parents. And lest
they should suffer shipwreck in a storm, they plunge headlong of their own accord in a calm,
being resolute not by virtue, but by perverse fear; as those who, through fear of being slain
by the enemy, slay themselves, that by death they may avoid death. So these men, without
honour and without influence, throw away the means by which they might have acquired
the glory of liberality. Democritus is praised because he abandoned his fields, and suffered
them to become public pastures. I should approve of it, if he had given them. But nothing
is done wisely which is useless and evil if it is done by all. But this negligence is tolerable.
What shall I say of him who changed his possessions into money, which he threw into the
sea? I doubt whether he was in his senses, or deranged. Away, he says, ye evil desires, into
the deep. I will cast you away, lest I myself should be cast away by you. If you have so great
a contempt for money, employ it in acts of kindness and humanity, bestow it upon the poor;
this, which you are about to throw away, may be a succour to many, so that they may not
die through famine, or thirst, or nakedness. Imitate at least the madness and fury of
Tuditanus;460 scatter abroad your property to be seized by the people. You have it in your
power both to escape the possession of money, and yet to lay it out to advantage; for whatever
has been profitable to many is securely laid out.</p>
<p>But who approves of the equality of faults as laid down by Zeno? But let us omit that
which is always received with derision by all. This is sufficient to prove the error of this
madman, that he places pity among vices and diseases. He deprives us of an affection, which
involves almost the whole course of human life. For since the nature of man is more feeble
than that of the other animals, which divine providence has armed with natural means of
protection,461 either to endure the severity of the seasons or to ward off attacks from their
bodies, because none of these things has been given to man, he has received in the place of
all these things the affection of pity, which is truly called humanity, by which we might
mutually protect each other. For if a man were rendered savage by the sight of another man,
which we see happen in the case of those animals which are of a solitary462 nature, there

would be no society among men, no care or system in the building of cities; and thus life
would not even be safe, since the weakness of men would both be exposed to the attacks of
the other animals, and they would rage among themselves after the manner of wild beasts.
Nor is his madness less in other things.</p>
<p>For what can be said respecting him who asserted that snow was black? How naturally
it followed, that he should also assert that pitch was white! This is he who said that he was
born for this purpose, that he might behold the heaven and the sun, who beheld nothing
on the earth when the sun was shining. Xenophanes most foolishly believed mathematicians
who said that the orb of the moon was eighteen times larger than the earth; and, as was
consistent with this folly, he said that within the concave surface of the moon there was
another earth, and that there another race of men live in a similar manner to that in which
we live on this earth. Therefore these lunatics have another moon, to hold forth to them a
light by night, as this does to us. And perhaps this globe of ours may be a moon to another
earth below this.463 Seneca says that there was one among the Stoics who used to deliberate
whether he should assign to the sun also its own inhabitants; he acted foolishly in doubting.
For what injury would he have inflicted if he had assigned them? But I believe the heat deterred
him, so as not to imperil so great a multitude; lest, if they should perish through excessive
heat, so great a calamity should be said to have happened by his fault.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIV.—OF THE ANTIPODES, THE HEAVEN, AND THE STARS.</head>
<p>How is it with those who imagine that there are antipodes464 opposite to our footsteps?
Do they say anything to the purpose? Or is there any one so senseless as to believe that there
are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads? or that the things which with us are
in a recumbent position, with them hang in an inverted direction? that the crops and trees
grow downwards? that the rains, and snow, and hail fall upwards to the earth? And does
any one wonder that hanging gardens465 are mentioned among the seven wonders of the
world, when philosophers make hanging fields, and seas, and cities, and mountains? The
origin of this error must also be set forth by us. For they are always deceived in the same
manner. For when they have assumed anything false in the commencement of their investigations,
led by the resemblance of the truth, they necessarily fall into those things which
are its consequences. Thus they fall into many ridiculous things; because those things which
are in agreement with false things, must themselves be false. But since they placed confidence
in the first, they do not consider the character of those things which follow, but defend them
in every way; whereas they ought to judge from those which follow, whether the first are
true or false.</p>
<p>What course of argument, therefore, led them to the idea of the antipodes? They saw
the courses of the stars travelling towards the west; they saw that the sun and the moon always
set towards the same quarter, and rise from the same. But since they did not perceive what
contrivance regulated their courses, nor how they returned from the west to the east, but
supposed that the heaven itself sloped downwards in every direction, which appearance it
must present on account of its immense breadth, they thought that the world is round like
a ball, and they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the
heavenly bodies; and thus that the stars and sun, when they have set, by the very rapidity of
the motion of the world466 are borne back to the east. Therefore they both constructed
brazen orbs, as though after the figure of the world, and engraved upon them certain monstrous
images, which they said were constellations. It followed, therefore, from this rotundity
of the heaven, that the earth was enclosed in the midst of its curved surface. But if this were
so, the earth also itself must be like a globe; for that could not possibly be anything but
round, which was held enclosed by that which was round. But if the earth also were round,
it must necessarily happen that it should present the same appearance to all parts of the
heaven; that is, that it should raise aloft mountains, extend plains, and have level seas. And
if this were so, that last consequence also followed, that there would be no part of the earth

uninhabited by men and the other animals. Thus the rotundity of the earth leads, in addition,
to the invention of those suspended antipodes.</p>
<p>But if you inquire from those who defend these marvellous fictions, why all things do
not fall into that lower part of the heaven, they reply that such is the nature of things, that
heavy bodies are borne to the middle, and that they are all joined together towards the
middle, as we see spokes in a wheel; but that the bodies which are light, as mist, smoke, and
fire, are borne away from the middle, so as to seek the heaven. I am at a loss what to say respecting
those who, when they have once erred, consistently persevere in their folly, and
defend one vain thing by another; but that I sometimes imagine that they either discuss
philosophy for the sake of a jest, or purposely and knowingly undertake to defend falsehoods,
as if to exercise or display their talents on false subjects. But I should be able to prove by
many arguments that it is impossible for the heaven to be lower than the earth, were is not
that this book must now be concluded, and that some things still remain, which are more
necessary for the present work. And since it is not the work of a single book to run over the
errors of each individually, let it be sufficient to have enumerated a few, from which the
nature of the others may be understood.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXV.—OF LEARNING PHILOSOPHY, AND WHAT GREAT
QUALIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR ITS PURSUIT.</head>
<p>We must now speak a few things concerning philosophy in general, that having
strengthened our cause we may conclude. That greatest imitator of Plato among our writers
thought that philosophy was not for the multitude, because none but learned men could
attain to it. “Philosophy,” says Cicero,467 “is contented with a few judges, of its own accord
designedly avoiding the multitude.” It is not therefore wisdom, if it avoids the concourse of
men; since, if wisdom is given to man, it is given to all without any distinction, so that there
is no one at all who cannot acquire it. But they so embrace virtue, which is given to the human
race, that they alone of all appear to wish to enjoy that which is a public good; being as envious
as if they should wish to bind or tear out the eyes of others that they may not see the
sun. For what else is it to deny wisdom to men, than to take away from their minds the true
and divine light? But if the nature of man is capable of wisdom, it was befitting that both
workmen, and country people, and women, and all, in short, who bear the human form,
should be taught to be wise; and that the people should be brought together from every
language, and condition, and sex, and age. Therefore it is a very strong argument that
philosophy neither tends to wisdom, nor is of itself wisdom, that its mystery is only made
known by the beard and cloak of the philosophers.468 The Stoics, moreover, perceived this,
who said that philosophy was to be studied both by slaves and women; Epicurus also, who
invites those who are altogether unacquainted with letters to philosophy; and Plato also,
who wished to compose a state of wise men.</p>
<p>They attempted, indeed, to do that which truth required; but they were unable to proceed
beyond words. First, because instruction in many arts is necessary for an application to
philosophy. Common learning must be acquired on account of practice in reading, because
in so great a variety of subjects it is impossible that all things should be learned by hearing,
or retained in the memory. No little attention also must be given to the grammarians, in
order that you may know the right method of speaking. That must occupy many years. Nor
must there be ignorance of rhetoric, that you may be able to utter and express the things
which you have learned. Geometry also, and music, and astronomy, are necessary, because
these arts have some connection with philosophy; and the whole of these subjects cannot
be learned by women, who must learn within the years of their maturity the duties which
are hereafter about to be of service to them for domestic uses; nor by servants, who must
live in service during those years especially in which they are able to learn; nor by the poor,
or labourers, or rustics, who have to gain their daily support by labour. And on this account
Tully says that philosophy is averse from the multitude. But yet Epicurus will receive the
<note type="footnote">467 Tusc., ii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">468 A long beard and cloak were the badges of the philosophers. [See vol. ii. p. 321, note 9.]</note>

<pb n="204"/>
ignorant.469 How, then, will they understand those things which are said respecting the first
principles of things, the perplexities and intricacies of which are scarcely attained to by men
of cultivated minds?</p>
<p>Therefore, in subjects which are involved in obscurity, and confused by a variety of intellects,
and set off by the studied language of eloquent men, what place is there for the unskilful
and ignorant? Lastly, they never taught any women to study philosophy, except
Themiste470 only, within the whole memory of man; nor slaves, except Phædo471 only, who
is said, when living in oppressive slavery, to have been ransomed and taught by Cebes. They
also enumerate Plato and Diogenes: these, however, were not slaves, though they had fallen
into servitude, for they had been taken captive. A certain Aniceris is said to have ransomed
Plato for eight sesterces. And on this account Seneca severely rebuked the ransomer himself,
because he set so small value upon Plato. He was a madman, as it seems to me, who was
angry with a man because he did not throw away much money; doubtless he ought to have
weighed gold as though to ransom the corpse of Hector, or to have insisted upon the payment
of more money than the seller demanded. Moreover, they taught none of the barbarians,
with the single exception of Anacharsis the Scythian, who never would have dreamed of
philosophy had he not previously learned both language and literature.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVI.—IT IS DIVINE INSTRUCTION ONLY WHICH BESTOWS WISDOM;
AND OF WHAT EFFICACY THE LAW OF GOD IS.</head>
<p>That, therefore, which they perceived to be justly required by the demands of nature,
but which they were themselves unable to perform, and saw that the philosophers could
not effect, is accomplished only by divine instruction; for that only is wisdom. Doubtless
they were able to persuade any one who do not even persuade themselves of anything; or
they will crush the desires, moderate the anger, and restrain the lusts of any one, when they
themselves both yield to vices, and acknowledge that they are overpowered by nature. But
what influence is exerted on the souls of men by the precepts of God, because of their simplicity
and truth, is shown by daily proofs. Give me a man who is passionate, scurrilous,
and unrestrained; with a very few words of God,
<lg>
<l>“I will render him as gentle as a sheep.”472</l>
</lg>
Give me one who is grasping, covetous, and tenacious; I will presently restore him to you
liberal, and freely bestowing his money with full hands. Give me a man who is afraid of pain
and death; he shall presently despise crosses, and fires, and the bull of Phalaris.473 Give me
one who is lustful, an adulterer, a glutton; you shall presently see him sober, chaste, and
temperate. Give me one who is cruel and bloodthirsty: that fury shall presently be changed
into true clemency. Give me a man who is unjust, foolish, an evil-doer; forthwith he shall
be just, and wise, and innocent: for by one laver474 all his wickedness shall be taken away.
So great is the power of divine wisdom, that, when infused into the breast of man, by one
impulse it once for all expels folly, which is the mother of faults, for the effecting of which
there is no need of payment, or books, or nightly studies. These results are accomplished
gratuitously, easily, and quickly, if only the ears are open and the breast thirsts for wisdom.
Let no one fear: we do not sell water, nor offer the sun for a reward. The fountain of God,
most abundant and most full, is open to all; and this heavenly light rises for all,475 as many
as have eyes. Did any of the philosophers effect these things, or is he able to effect them if
he wishes? For though they spend their lives in the study of philosophy, they are neither
able to improve any other person nor themselves (if nature has presented any obstacle).
Therefore their wisdom, doing its utmost, does not eradicate, but hide vices. But a few precepts
of God so entirely change the whole man, and having put off the old man, render him
new, that you would not recognise him as the same.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVII.—HOW LITTLE THE PRECEPTS OF PHILOSOPHERS CONTRIBUTE
TO TRUE WISDOM, WHICH YOU WILL FIND IN RELIGION ONLY.</head>
<p>What, then? Do they enjoin nothing similar? Yes, indeed, many things; and they frequently
approach the truth. But those precepts have no weight, because they are human,
and are without a greater, that is, that divine authority. No one therefore believes them,
because the hearer imagines himself to be a man, just as he is, who enjoins them. Moreover,
there is no certainty with them, nothing which proceeds from knowledge. But since all things
are done by conjecture, and many differing and various things are brought forward, it is the
part of a most foolish man to be willing to obey their precepts, since it is doubted whether
they are true or false; and therefore no one obeys them, because no one wishes to labour for
an uncertainty. The Stoics say that it is virtue which can alone produce a happy life. Nothing
can be said with greater truth. But what if he shall be tormented, or afflicted with pain? Will
it be possible for any one to be happy in the hands of the executioners? But truly pain inflicted
upon the body is the material of virtue; therefore he is not wretched even in tortures. Epicurus
speaks much more strongly. The wise man, he says, is always happy; and even when shut
up in the bull of Phalaris he will utter this speech: “It is pleasant, and I do not care for it.”
Who would not laugh at him? Especially, because a man who is devoted to pleasure took
upon himself the character of a man of fortitude, and that to an immoderate degree; for it
is impossible that any one should esteem tortures of the body as pleasures, since it is sufficient
for discharging the office of virtue that one sustains and endures them. What do you, Stoics,
say? What do you, Epicurus? The wise man is happy even when be is tortured. If it is on
account of the glory of his endurance, he will not enjoy it, for perchance he will die under
the tortures. If it is on account of the recollection of the deed, either he will not perceive it
if souls shall perish, or, if he shall perceive it, he will gain nothing from it.</p>
<p>What other advantage is there then in virtue? what happiness of life? Is it that a man
may die with equanimity? You present to me the advantage of a single hour, or perhaps
moment, for the sake of which it may not be expedient to be worn out by miseries and labours
throughout the whole of life. But how much time does death occupy? on the arrival of which
it now makes no difference whether you shall have undergone it with equanimity or not.
Thus it happens that nothing is sought from virtue but glory. But this is either superfluous
and short-lived, or it will not follow from the depraved judgments of men. Therefore there
is no fruit from virtue where virtue is subject to death and decay. Therefore they who said
these things saw a certain shadow476 of virtue; they did not see virtue itself. For they had
their eyes fixed on the earth, nor did they raise their countenances on high that they might
behold her
<note type="footnote">476 A shadow; outline, or resemblance.</note>

<pb n="207"/>
<lg>
<l>“Who showed herself from the quarters of heaven.”477</l>
</lg>
This is the reason why no one obeys their precepts; inasmuch as they either train men to
vices, if they defend pleasure; or if they uphold virtue, they neither threaten sin with any
punishment, except that of disgrace only, nor do they promise any reward to virtue, except
that of honour and praise only, since they say that virtue is to be sought for its own sake,
and not on account of any other object. The wise man therefore is happy under tortures;
but when he suffers torture on account of his faith, on account of justice, or on account of
God, that endurance of pain will render him most happy. For it is God alone who can honour
virtue, the reward of which is immortality alone. And they who do not seek this, nor possess
religion, with which eternal life is connected, assuredly do not know the power of virtue,
the reward of which they are ignorant; nor look towards heaven, as they themselves imagine
that they do, when they inquire into subjects which do not admit of investigation, since
there is no other cause for looking towards heaven, unless it be either to undertake religion,
or to believe that one’s soul is immortal. For if any one understands that God is to be worshipped,
or has the hope of immortality set before him, his mind478 is in heaven; and although
he may not behold it with his eyes, yet he does behold it with the eye of his soul. But they
who do not take up religion are of the earth, for religion is from heaven; and they who think
that the soul perishes together with the body, equally look down towards the earth: for
beyond the body, which is earth, they see nothing further, which is immortal. It is therefore
of no profit that man is so made, that with upright body he looks towards heaven, unless
with mind raised aloft he discerns God, and his thoughts are altogether engaged upon the
hope of everlasting life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVIII.—OF TRUE RELIGION AND OF NATURE. WHETHER FORTUNE
IS A GODDESS, AND OF PHILOSOPHY.</head>
<p>Wherefore there is nothing else in life on which our plan and condition can depend but
the knowledge of God who created us, and the religious and pious worship of Him; and
since the philosophers have wandered from this, it is plain that they were not wise. They
sought wisdom, indeed; but because they did not seek it in a right manner, they sunk down
to a greater distance, and fell into such great errors, that they did not even possess common
wisdom. For they were not only unwilling to maintain religion, but they even took it away;
while, led on by the appearance of false virtue, they endeavour to free the mind from all
fear: and this overturning of religion gains the name of nature. For they, either being ignorant
by whom the world was made, or wishing to persuade men that nothing was completed by
divine intelligence, said that nature was the mother of all things, as though they should say
that all things were produced of their own accord: by which word they altogether confess
their own ignorance. For nature, apart from divine providence and power, is absolutely
nothing. But if they call God nature, what perverseness is it, to use the name of nature rather
than of God!479 But if nature is the plan, or necessity, or condition of birth, it is not by itself
capable of sensation; but there must necessarily be a divine mind, which by its foresight
furnishes the beginning of their existence to all things. Or if nature is heaven and earth, and
everything which is created, nature is not God, but the work of God.</p>
<p>By a similar error they believe in the existence of fortune, as a goddess mocking the affairs
of then with various casualties, because they know not from what source things good and
evil happen to them. They think that they are brought together to do battle with her; nor
do they assign any reason by whom and on what account they are thus matched; but they
only boast that they are every moment carrying on a contest for life and death with fortune.
Now, as many as have consoled any persons on account of the death and removal of friends,
have censured the name of fortune with the most severe accusations; nor is there any disputation
of theirs on the subject of virtue, in which fortune is not harassed. M. Tullius, in his
Consolation, says that he has always fought against fortune, and that she was always overpowered
by him when he had valiantly beaten back the attacks of his enemies; that he was
not subdued by her even then, when he was driven from his home and deprived of his
country; but then, when he lost his dearest daughter, he shamefully confesses that he is
overcome by fortune. I yield, he says, and raise my hand.480 What is more wretched than
this man, who thus lies prostrate? He acts foolishly, he says; but it is one who professes that
<note type="footnote">479 [Quod si Deum naturam vocant quæ perversitas est naturam potius quam Deum nominare. Observe
this terse maxim of our author. It rebukes the teachers and scientists of our day, who seem afraid to “look through

<note type="footnote">480 To raise or stretch out the hand was an acknowledgment of defeat.</note>

<pb n="209"/>
he is wise. What, then, does the assumption of the name imply? What that contempt of
things which is laid claim to with magnificent words? What that dress, so different from
others? Or why do you give precepts of wisdom at all, if no one has yet been found who is
wise? And does any one bear ill-will to us because we deny that philosophers are wise, when
they themselves confess that they neither have knowledge nor wisdom? For if at any time
they have so failed that they are not even able to feign anything, as their practice is in other
cases, then in truth they are reminded of their ignorance; and, as though in madness, they
spring up and exclaim that they are blind and foolish. Anaxagoras pronounces that all things
are overspread with darkness. Empedocles complains that the paths of the senses are narrow,
as though for his reflections he had need of a chariot and four horses. Democritus says that
the truth lies sunk in a well so deep that it has no bottom; foolishly, indeed, as he says other
things. For the truth is not, as it were, sunk in a well to which it was permitted him to descend,
or even to fall, but, as it were, placed on the highest top of a lofty mountain, or in heaven,
which is most true. For what reason is there why he should say that it is sunk below rather
than that it is raised aloft? unless by chance he preferred to place the mind also in the feet,
or in the bottom of the heels, rather than in the breast or in the head.</p>
<p>So widely removed were they from the truth itself, that even the posture of their own
body did not admonish them, that the truth must be sought for by them in the highest
place.481 From this despair arose that confession of Socrates, in which he said that he knew
nothing but this one thing alone, that he knew nothing. From this flowed the system of the
Academy, if that is to be called a system in which ignorance is both learnt and taught. But
not even those who claimed for themselves knowledge were able consistently to defend that
very thing which they thought that they knew. For since they were not in agreement482 with
one another, through their ignorance of divine things they were so inconsistent and uncertain,
and often asserting things contrary to one another, that you are unable to determine and
decide what their meaning was. Why therefore should you fight against those men who
perish by their own sword? Why should you labour to refute those whom their own speech
refutes and presses?483 Aristotle, says Cicero, accusing the ancient philosophers, declares
that they are either most foolish or most vainglorious, since they thought that philosophy
was perfected by their talents; but that he saw, because a great addition had been made in
a few years, that philosophy would be complete in a short time. What, then, was that time?
In what manner, when, or by whom, was philosophy completed? For that which he said,
that they were most foolish in supposing that philosophy was made perfect by their talents,
is true; but he did not even himself speak with sufficient discretion, who thought that it had

would shortly be brought to perfection by those of later times. For that can never be investigated

<head>CHAP. XXIX.—OF FORTUNE AGAIN, AND VIRTUE.</head>
<p>But let us return to the subject which we laid aside. Fortune, therefore, by itself, is
nothing; nor must we so regard it as though it had any perception, since fortune is the sudden
and unexpected occurrence of accidents. But philosophers, that they may not sometimes
fail to err, wish to be wise in a foolish matter; and say that she is not a goddess, as is generally
believed, but a god. Sometimes, however, they call this god nature, sometimes fortune,
“because he brings about,” says the same Cicero, “many things unexpected by us, on account
of our want of intelligence and our ignorance of causes.” Since, therefore, they are ignorant
of the causes on account of which anything is done, they must also be ignorant of him who
does them. The same writer, in a work of great seriousness, in which he was giving to his
son precepts of life drawn from philosophy, says, “Who can be ignorant that the power of
fortune is great on either side? For both when we meet with a prosperous breeze from her
we gain the issues which we desire, and when she has breathed contrary to us we are dashed
on the rocks.”484 First of all, he who says that nothing can be known, spoke this as though
he himself and all men had knowledge. Then he who endeavours to render doubtful even
the things which are plain, thought that this was plain, which ought to have been to him
especially doubtful; for to a wise man it is altogether false. Who, he says, knows not? I indeed
know not. Let him teach me, if he can, what that power is, what that breeze, and what the
contrary breath.</p>
<p>It is disgraceful, therefore, for a man of talent to say that, which if you were to deny it,
he would be unable to prove. Lastly, he who says that the assent must be withheld because
it is the part of a foolish man rashly to assent to things which are unknown to him, he, I say,
altogether believed the opinions of the vulgar and uninstructed, who think that it is fortune
which gives to men good and evil things. For they represent her image with the horn of
plenty and with a rudder, as though she both gave wealth and had the government of human
affairs. And to this opinion Virgil485 assented, who calls fortune omnipotent; and the historian486
who says, But assuredly fortune bears sway in everything. What place, then, remains
for the other gods? Why is she not said to reign by herself, if she has more power than others;
or why is she not alone worshipped, if she has power in all things? Or if she inflicts evils
only, let them bring forward some cause why, if she is a goddess, she envies men, and desires
their destruction, though she is religiously worshipped by them; why she is more favourable
to the wicked and more unfavourable to the good; why she plots, afflicts, deceives, exterminates;
who appointed her as the perpetual harasser of the race of men; why, in short, she
has obtained so mischievous a power, that she renders all things illustrious or obscure ac-

<pb n="212"/>
cording to her caprice rather than in accordance with the truth. Philosophers, I say, ought
rather to have inquired into these things, than rashly to have accused fortune, who is innocent:
for although she has some existence, yet no reason can be brought forward by them
why she should be as hostile to men as she is supposed to be. Therefore all those speeches
in which they rail at the injustice of fortune, and in opposition to fortune arrogantly boast
of their own virtues, are nothing else but the ravings of thoughtless levity.</p>
<p>Wherefore let them not envy us, to whom God has revealed the truth: who, as we know
that fortune is nothing, so also know that there is a wicked and crafty spirit who is unfriendly
to the good, and the enemy of righteousness, who acts in opposition to God; the cause of
whose enmity we have explained in the second book.487 He therefore lays plots against all;
but those who are ignorant of God he hinders by error, he overwhelms with folly, he overspreads
with darkness, that no one may be able to attain to the knowledge of the divine
name, in which alone are contained both wisdom and everlasting life. Those, on the other
hand, who know God, he assails with wiles and craft, that he may ensnare them with desire
and lust, and when they are corrupted by the blandishments of sin, may impel them to death;
or, if he shall have not succeeded by stratagem, he attempts to cast them down by force and
violence. For on this account he was not at once thrust down by God to punishment at the
original transgression, that by his malice he may exercise man to virtue: for unless this is in
constant agitation, unless it is strengthened by continual harassing, it cannot be perfect,
inasmuch as virtue is dauntless and unconquered patience in enduring evils. From which
it comes to pass that there is no virtue if an adversary is wanting. When, therefore, they
perceived the force of this perverse power opposed to virtue, and were ignorant of its name,
they invented for themselves the senseless name of fortune; and how far this is removed
from wisdom, Juvenal declares in these verses:488—
<lg>
<l>“No divine power is absent if there is prudence; but we make you a goddess, O</l>
<l>Fortune, and place you in heaven.”</l>
</lg>
It was folly, therefore, and error, and blindness, and, as Cicero says,489 ignorance of facts
and causes, which introduced the names of Nature and Fortune. But as they are ignorant
of their adversary, so also they do not indeed know virtue the knowledge of which is derived
from the idea of an adversary. And if this is joined with wisdom, or, as they say, is itself also
wisdom, they must be ignorant in what subjects it is contained. For no one can possibly be
furnished with true arms if he is ignorant of the enemy against whom he must be armed;

<head>CHAP. XXX.—THE CONCLUSION OF THE THINGS BEFORE SPOKEN; AND BY
WHAT MEANS WE MUST PASS FROM THE VANITY OF THE PHILOSOPHERS TO
TRUE WISDOM, AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE GOD, IN WHICH ALONE
ARE VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS.</head>
<p>I have taught, as far as my humble talents permitted, that the philosophers held a course
widely deviating from the truth. I perceive, however, how many things I have omitted, because
it was not my province to enter into a disputation against philosophers. But it was necessary
for me to make a digression to this subject, that I might show that so many and great intellects
have expended themselves in vain on false subjects, lest any one by chance being shut out
by corrupt superstitions, should wish to betake himself to them as though about to find
some certainty. Therefore the only hope, the only safety for man, is placed in this doctrine,
which we defend. All the wisdom of man consists in this alone, the knowledge and worship
of God: this is our tenet, this our opinion. Therefore with all the power of my voice I testify,
I proclaim, I declare: Here, here is that which all philosophers have sought throughout their
whole life; and yet, they have not been able to investigate, to grasp, and to attain to it, because
they either retained a religion which was corrupt, or took it away altogether. Let them
therefore all depart, who do not instruct human life, but throw it into confusion. For what
do they teach? or whom do they instruct, who have not yet instructed themselves? whom
are the sick able to heal, whom can the blind guide? Let us all, therefore, who have any regard
for wisdom, betake ourselves to this subject. Or shall we wait until Socrates knows something?
or Anaxagoras finds light in the darkness? or until Democritus draws forth truth from the
well? or Empedocles extends the paths of his soul? or until Arcesilas and Carneades see, and
feel, and perceive?</p>
<p>Lo, a voice from heaven teaching the truth, and displaying to us a light brighter than
the sun itself.490 Why are we unjust to ourselves, and delay to take up wisdom, which learned
men, though they wasted their lives in its pursuit, were never able to discover. Let him who
wishes to be wise and happy hear the voice of God, learn righteousness, understand the
mystery of his birth, despise human affairs, embrace divine things, that he may gain that
chief good to which he was born. Having overthrown all false religions, and having refuted
all the arguments, as many as it was customary or possible to bring forward in their defence;
then, having proved the systems of philosophy to be false, we must now come to true religion
and wisdom, since, as I shall teach, they are both connected together; that we may maintain
it either by arguments, or by examples, or by competent witnesses, and may show that the
folly with which those worshippers of gods do not cease to upbraid us, has no existence with
us, but lies altogether with them. And although, in the former books, when I was contending
against false religions, and in this, when I was overthrowing false wisdom, I showed where

OF TRUE WISDOM AND RELIGION.</head>

<pb n="217"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—OF THE FORMER RELIGION OF MEN, AND HOW ERROR WAS SPREAD
OVER EVERY AGE, AND OF THE SEVEN WISE MEN OF GREECE.</head>
<p>When I reflect, O Emperor Constantine, and often revolve in my mind the original
condition of men, it is accustomed to appear alike wonderful and unworthy that, by the
folly of one age embracing various superstitions, and believing in the existence of many
gods, they suddenly arrived at such ignorance of themselves, that the truth being taken away
from their eyes, the religion of the true God was not observed, nor the condition of human
nature, since men did not seek the chief good in heaven, but on earth. And on this account
assuredly the happiness of the ancient ages was changed. For, having left God, the parent
and founder of all things, men began to worship the senseless works491 of their own hands.
And what were the effects of this corruption, or what evils it introduced, the subject itself
sufficiently declares. For, turning away from the chief good, which is blessed and everlasting
on this account, because it cannot be seen,492 or touched, or comprehended, and from the
virtues which are in agreement with that good, and which are equally immortal, gliding
down to these corrupt and frail gods, and devoting themselves to those things by which the
body only is adorned, and nourished, and delighted, they sought eternal death for themselves,
together with their gods and goods relating to the body, because all bodies are subject to
death. Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and impiety, as must
necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their countenances to the heaven; but, their
minds being depressed downwards, clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born
superstitions. There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all wickedness;
because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which alone ought to be desired by man,
they rather chose temporal and short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in
evil, inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented itself as nearer at
hand.493</p>
<p>Thus human life, which in former ages had been occupied with the clearest light, was
overspread with gloom and darkness; and in conformity with this depravity, when wisdom
was taken away, then at length men began to claim for themselves the name of wise. For at
the time when all were wise, no one was called by that name. And would that this name,
once common to all the class, though reduced to a few, still retained its power! For those
few might perhaps be able, either by talent, or by authority, or by continual exhortations,
to free the people from vices and errors. But so entirely had wisdom died out, that it is
evident, from the very arrogance of the name, that no one of those who were so called was

<pb n="218"/>
really wise. And yet, before the discovery of this philosophy, as it is termed, there are said
to have been seven,494 who, because they ventured to inquire into and discuss natural subjects,
deserved to be esteemed and called wise men.</p>
<p>O wretched and calamitous age, in which through the whole world there were only
seven who were called by the name of men, for no one can justly be called a man unless he
is wise! But if all the others besides themselves were foolish, even they themselves were not
wise, because no one can be truly wise in the judgment of the foolish. So far were they removed
from wisdom, that not even afterwards, when learning increased, and many and
great intellects were always intent upon this very subject, could the truth be perceived and
ascertained. For, after the renown of those seven wise men, it is incredible with how great
a desire of inquiring into the truth all Greece was inflamed. And first of all, they thought495
the very name of wisdom arrogant, and did not call themselves wise men, but desirous of
wisdom. By which deed they both condemned those who had rashly arrogated to themselves
the name of wise men, of error and folly, and themselves also of ignorance, which indeed
they did not deny. For wherever the nature of the subject had, as it were, laid its hands upon
their minds, so that they were unable to give any account, they were accustomed to testify
that, they knew nothing, and discerned nothing. Wherefore they are found to be much
wiser, who in some degree saw themselves, than those who had believed that they were wise.</p>
<note type="footnote">494 The seven wise men were, Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus, Chilo, and Periander. To these some

<head>CHAP. II.—WHERE WISDOM IS TO BE FOUND; WHY PYTHAGORAS AND PLATO
DID NOT APPROACH THE JEWS.</head>
<p>Wherefore, if they were not wise who were so called, nor those of later times, who did
not hesitate to confess their want of wisdom, what remains but that wisdom is to be sought
elsewhere, since it has not been found where it was sought. But what can we suppose to have
been the reason why it was not found, though sought with the greatest earnestness and labour
by so many intellects, and during so many ages, unless it be that philosophers sought for it
out of their own limits? And since they traversed and explored all parts, but nowhere found
any wisdom, and it must of necessity be somewhere, it is evident that it ought especially to
be sought there where the title of folly496 appears; under the covering of which God hides
the treasury of wisdom and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to
view.497 Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and after him Plato,
inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians,
and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted with their religious rites and
institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach
the Jews only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have
gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by divine providence,
that they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the religion of the
true God and righteousness to become known to men of other nations.498 For God had
determined, as the last time drew near,499 to send from heaven a great leader,500 who should
reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away from a perfidious501 and ungrateful
people. And I will endeavour to discuss the subject in this book, if I shall first have shown
that wisdom is so closely united with religion, that the one cannot be separated from the
other.</p>

<pb n="220"/>
<head>CHAP. III.—WISDOM AND RELIGION CANNOT BE SEPARATED: THE LORD OF
NATURE MUST NECESSARILY BE THE FATHER OF EVERY ONE.</head>
<p>The worship of the gods, as I have taught in the former book, does not imply wisdom;
not only because it gives up man, who is a divine animal, to earthly and frail things, but
because nothing is fixed in it which may avail for the cultivation of the character and the
framing of the life; nor does it contain any investigation of the truth, but only the rite of
worship, which does not consist in the service of the mind, but in the employment of the
body. And therefore that is not to be deemed true religion, because it instructs and improves
men by no precepts of righteousness and virtue. Thus philosophy, inasmuch as it does not
possess true religion, that is, the highest piety, is not true wisdom. For if the divinity which
governs this world supports mankind with incredible beneficence, and cherishes it as with
paternal indulgence, wishes truly that gratitude should be paid, and honour given to itself,
man cannot preserve his piety if he shall prove ungrateful for the heavenly benefits; and this
is certainly not the part of a wise man. Since, therefore, as I have said, philosophy and the
religious system of the gods are separated, and far removed from each other; seeing that
some are professors of wisdom, through whom it is manifest that there is no approach to
the gods, and that others are priests of religion, through whom wisdom is not learned; it is
manifest that the one is not true wisdom, and that the other is not true religion. Therefore
philosophy was not able to conceive the truth, nor was the religious system of the gods able
to give an account of itself, since it is without it. But where wisdom is joined by an inseparable
connection with religion, both must necessarily be true; because in our worship we ought
to be wise, that is, to know the proper object and mode of worship, and in our wisdom to
worship, that is, to complete our knowledge by deed and action.</p>
<p>Where, then, is wisdom joined with religion? There, indeed, where the one God is
worshipped, where life and every action is referred to one source, and to one supreme authority:
in short, the teachers of wisdom are the same, who are also the priests of God.502
Nor, however, let it affect any one, because it often has happened, and may happen, that
some philosopher may undertake a priesthood of the gods; and when this happens, philosophy
is not, however, joined with religion; but philosophy will both be unemployed amidst
sacred rites, and religion will be unemployed when philosophy shall be treated of. For that
system of religious rites is dumb, not only because it relates to gods who are dumb, but also
because its observance is by the hand and the fingers, not by the heart and tongue, as is the
case with ours, which is true. Therefore religion is contained in wisdom, and wisdom in
religion. The one, then, cannot be separated from the other; because wisdom is nothing else
but the worship of the true God with just and pious adoration. But that the worship of many
gods is not in accordance with nature, may be inferred and conceived even by this argument:
<note type="footnote">502 [Iidem sunt doctores sapientiæ qui et De. sacerdotes.]</note>

<pb n="221"/>
that every god who is worshipped by man must, amidst the solemn rites and prayers, be
invoked as father, not only for the sake of honour, but also of reason; because he is both
more ancient than man, and because he affords life, safety, and sustenance, as a father does.
Therefore Jupiter is called father by those who pray to him, as is Saturnus, and Janus, and
Liber, and the rest in order; which Lucilius503 laughs at in the council of the gods: “So that
there is none of us who is not called excellent father of the gods; so that father Neptunus,
Liber, father Saturnus, Mars, Janus, father Quirinus, are called after one name.” But if nature
does not permit that one man should have many fathers (for he is produced from one only),
therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to nature, and contrary to piety.</p>
<p>One only, therefore, is to be worshipped, who can truly be called Father. He also must
of necessity be Lord, because as He has power to indulge, so also has He power to restrain.
He is to be called Father on this account, because He bestows upon us many and great things;
and Lord on this account, because He has the greatest power of chastising and punishing.
But that He who is Father is also Lord, is shown even by reference to civil law.504 For who
will be able to bring up sons, unless he has the power of a lord over them? Nor without
reason is he called father of a household,505 although he only has sons: for it is plain that
the name of father embraces also slaves, because “household” follows; and the name of
“household” comprises also sons, because the name of “father” precedes: from which it is
evident, that the same person is both father of his slaves506 and lord of his sons. Lastly, the
son is set at liberty as if he were a slave; and the liberated slave receives the name507 of his
patron, as if he were a son. But if a man is named father of a household, that it may appear
that he is possessed of a double power, because as a father he ought to indulge, and as a lord
to restrain, it follows that he who is a son is also a slave, and that he who is a father is also
a lord. As, therefore, by the necessity of nature, there cannot be more than one father, so
there can only be one lord. For what will the slave do if many lords508 shall give commands
at variance with each other? Therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to reason and
<note type="footnote">503 [The satirist, not Cicero’s friend; Nat. Deor., iii.]</note>
<note type="footnote">504 Fathers in ancient times had the greatest power over their children, so that they had the right of life and
death, as masters had over their slaves.</note>
<note type="footnote">505 Pater familias—a title given to the master of a household, whether he had sons or not; the slaves of a
house were called familia</note>
<note type="footnote">506 It has been judged better to keep the words “slave” and “lord” throughout the passage, for the sake of
uniformity of expression, though in some places “servant” and “master” might seem more appropriate.</note>
<note type="footnote">507 Among the Romans slaves had no prænomen or distinguishing name; when a slave was set at liberty, he
was allowed to assume the name of his master as a prænomen. Thus, in Persius (Sat., v.), “Dama,” the liberated
slave, becomes “Marcus Dama.”</note>
<note type="footnote">508 Thus the slave in Terence wished to know how many masters he had.</note>

<pb n="222"/>
to nature, since there cannot be many fathers or lords; but it is necessary to consider the
gods both as fathers and lords.</p>
<p>Therefore the truth cannot be held where the same man is subject to many fathers and
lords, where the mind, drawn in different directions to many objects, wanders to and fro,
hither and thither. Nor can religion have any firmness, when it is without a fixed and settled
dwelling-place. Therefore there can be no true worship of many gods; just as that cannot
be called matrimony, in which one woman has many husbands, but she will either be called
a harlot or an adulteress. For when a woman is destitute of modesty, chastity, and fidelity,
she must of necessity be without virtue. Thus also the religious system of the gods is unchaste
and unholy, because it is destitute of faith, for that unsettled and uncertain honour has no
source or origin.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="223"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.—OF WISDOM LIKEWISE, AND RELIGION, AND OF THE RIGHT
OF FATHER AND LORD.</head>
<p>By these things it is evident how closely connected are wisdom and religion. Wisdom
relates to sons, and this relation requires love; religion to servants, and this relation requires
fear. For as the former are bound to love and honour their father, so are the latter bound to
respect and venerate their lord. But with respect to God, who is one only, inasmuch as He
sustains the twofold character both of Father and Lord, we are bound both to love Him,
inasmuch as we are sons, and to fear Him, inasmuch as we are servants.509 Religion, therefore,
cannot be divided from wisdom, nor can wisdom be separated from religion; because it is
the same God, who ought to be understood, which is the part of wisdom, and to be honoured,
which is the part of religion. But wisdom precedes, religion follows; for the knowledge of
God comes first, His worship is the result of knowledge. Thus in the two names there is but
one meaning, though it seems to be different in each case. For the one is concerned with
the understanding, the other with action. But, however, they resemble two streams flowing
from one fountain. But the fountain of wisdom and religion is God; and if these two streams
shall turn aside from Him, they must be dried up: for they who are ignorant of Him cannot
be wise or religious.</p>
<p>Thus it comes to pass that philosophers, and those who worship many gods, either resemble
disinherited sons or runaway slaves, because the one do not seek their father, nor
the other their master. And as they who are disinherited do not attain to the inheritance of
their father, nor runaway slaves impunity, so neither will philosophers receive immortality,
which is the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, that is, the chief good, which they especially
seek; nor will the worshippers of gods escape the penalty of everlasting death, which is the
punishment of the true Master against those who are deserters510 of His majesty and name.
But that God is Father and also Lord was unknown to both, to the worshippers of the gods
as well as to the professors of wisdom themselves: inasmuch as they either thought that
nothing at all was to be worshipped; or they approved of false religions; or, although they
understood the strength and power of the Supreme God (as Plato, who says that there is
one God, Creator of the world, and Marcus Tullius, who acknowledges that man has been
produced by the Supreme God in an excellent condition), nevertheless they did not render
the worship due to Him as to the supreme Father, which was their befitting and necessary
duty. But that the gods cannot be fathers or lords, is declared not only by their multitude,
as I have shown above,511 but also by reason: because it is not reported that man was made
<note type="footnote">509 Fear, in the language of the prophets often implies reverence of the divine majesty. Lactantius seems to

by gods, nor is it found that the gods themselves preceded the origin of man, since it appears
that there were men on the earth before the birth of Vulcan, and Liber, and Apollo, and
Jupiter himself. But the creation of man is not accustomed to be assigned to Saturnus, nor
to his father Coelus.</p>
<p>But if none of those who are worshipped is said to have originally formed and created
man, it follows that none of these can be called the father of man, and so none of them can
be God. Therefore it is not lawful to worship those by whom man was not produced, for he
could not be produced by many. Therefore the one and only God ought to be worshipped,
who was before Jupiter, and Saturnus, and Coelus himself, and the earth. For He must have
fashioned man, who, before the creation of man, finished the heaven and the earth. He alone
is to be called Father who created us; He alone is to be considered Lord who rules, who has
the true and perpetual power of life and death. And he who does not adore Him is a foolish
servant, who flees from or does not know his Master; and an undutiful son, who either hates
or is ignorant of his true Father.</p>

<head>CHAP. V.—THE ORACLES OF THE PROPHETS MUST BE LOOKED INTO; AND OF
THEIR TIMES, AND THE TIMES OF THE JUDGES AND KINGS.</head>
<p>Now, since I have shown that wisdom and religion cannot be separated, it remains that
we speak of religion itself, and wisdom. I am aware, indeed, how difficult it is to discuss
heavenly subjects; but still the attempt must be ventured, that the truth may be made clear
and brought to light, and that many may be freed from error and death, who despise and
refuse the truth, while it is concealed under a covering of folly. But before I begin to speak
of God and His works, I must first speak a few things concerning the prophets, whose
testimony I must now use, which I have refrained from doing in the former books. Above
all things, he who desires to comprehend the truth ought not only to apply his mind to understand
the utterances of the prophets, but also most diligently to inquire into the times
during which each one of them existed, that he may know what future events they predicted,
and after how many years their predictions were fulfilled.512 Nor is there any difficulty in
making these computations; for they testified under what king each of them received the
inspiration of the Divine Spirit. And many have written and published books respecting the
times, making their commencement from the prophet Moses, who lived about seven hundred
years before the Trojan war. But he, when he had governed the people for forty years, was
succeeded by Joshua, who held the chief place twenty-seven years.</p>
<p>After this they were under the government of judges during three hundred and seventy
years. Then their condition was changed, and they began to have kings; and when they had
ruled during four hundred and fifty years, until the reign of Zedekiah, the Jews having been
besieged by the king of Babylon, and carried into captivity,513 endured a long servitude,
until, in the seventieth year afterwards, the captive Jews were restored to their own lands
and settlements by Cyrus the elder, who attained the supreme power over the Persians, at
the time when Tarquinius Superbus reigned at Rome. Wherefore, since the whole series of
times may be collected both from the Jewish histories and from those of the Greeks and
Romans, the times of the prophets individually may also be collected; the last of whom was
Zechariah, and it is agreed on that he prophesied in the time of King Darius, in the second
year of his reign, and in the eighth month. Of so much greater antiquity514 are the prophets
found to be than the Greek writers. And I bring forward all these things, that they may
perceive their error who endeavour to refute Holy Scripture, as though it were new and recently
composed, being ignorant from what fountain the origin of our holy religion flowed.

<head>CHAP. VI.—ALMIGHTY GOD BEGAT HIS SON; AND THE TESTIMONIES OF THE
SIBYLS AND OF TRISMEGISTUS CONCERNING HIM.</head>
<p>God, therefore, the contriver and founder of all things, as we have said in the second
book, before He commenced this excellent work of the world, begat a pure and incorruptible
Spirit, whom He called His Son. And although He had afterwards created by Himself innumerable
other beings, whom we call angels, this first-begotten, however, was the only one
whom He considered worthy of being called by the divine name, as being powerful in His
Father’s excellence and majesty. But that there is a Son of the Most High God, who is possessed
of the greatest power, is shown not only by the unanimous utterances of the prophets,
but also by the declaration of Trismegistus and the predictions of the Sibyls. Hermes, in the
book which is entitled The Perfect Word, made use of these words: “The Lord and Creator
of all things, whom we have thought right to call God, since He made the second God visible
and sensible. But I use the term sensible, not because He Himself perceives (for the question
is not whether He Himself perceives), but because He leads515 to perception and to intelligence.
Since, therefore, He made Him first, and alone, and one only, He appeared to Him
beautiful, and most full of all good things; and He hallowed Him, and altogether loved Him
as His own Son.” The Erythræan Sibyl, in the beginning of her poem, which she commenced
with the Supreme God, proclaims the Son of God as the leader and commander of all, in
these verses:—
<lg>
<l>“The nourisher and creator of all things, who placed the sweet breath in all, and
made God the leader of all.”</l>
</lg>
And again, at the end of the same poem:—
<lg>
<l>“But whom God gave for faithful men to honour.”</l>
</lg>
And another Sibyl enjoins that He ought to be known:—
<lg>
<l>“Know Him as your God, who is the Son of God.”</l>
</lg>
Assuredly He is the very Son of God, who by that most wise King Solomon, full of divine
inspiration, spake these things which we have added:516, “God founded517 me in the beginning
of His ways, in His work before the ages. He set me up in the beginning, before He
made the earth, and before He established the depths, before the fountains of waters came
<note type="footnote">515 Literally, “sends.” The passage appears to be corrupt: ὑποπίπτει has been suggested instead of ὑποπέμπει,

forth: the Lord begat me before all the hills; He made the regions, and the uninhabitable518
boundaries under the heaven. When He prepared the heaven, I was by Him: and when He
separated His own seat, when He made the strong clouds above the winds, and when He
strengthened the mountains, and placed them under heaven; when He laid the strong
foundations of the earth, I was with Him arranging all things. I was He in whom He delighted:
I was daily delighted, when He rejoiced, the world being completed.” But on this account
Trismegistus spoke of Him as “the artificer of God,” and the Sibyl calls Him “Counsellor,”
because He is endowed by God the Father with such wisdom and strength, that God employed
both His wisdom and hands in the creation of the world.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF THE NAME OF SON, AND WHENCE HE IS CALLED JESUS AND
CHRIST.</head>
<p>Some one may perhaps ask who this is who is so powerful, so beloved by God, and what
name He has, who was not only begotten at first before the world,519 but who also arranged
it by His wisdom and constructed it by His might. First of all, it is befitting that we should
know that His name is not known even to the angels who dwell in heaven, but to Himself
only, and to God the Father; nor will that name be published, as the sacred writings relate,
before that the purpose of God shall be fulfilled. In the next place, we must know that this
name cannot be uttered by the mouth of man, as Hermes teaches, saying these things: “Now
the cause of this cause is the will of the divine good which produced God, whose name
cannot be uttered by the mouth of man.” And shortly afterwards to His Son: “There is, O
Son, a secret word of wisdom, holy respecting the only Lord of all things, and the God first
perceived520 by the mind, to speak of whom is beyond the power of man.” But although
His name, which the supreme Father gave Him from the beginning, is known to none but
Himself, nevertheless He has one name among the angels, and another among men, since
He is called Jesus521 among men: for Christ is not a proper name, but a title of power and
dominion; for by this the Jews were accustomed to call their kings. But the meaning of this
name must be set forth, on account of the error of the ignorant, who by the change of a letter
are accustomed to call Him Chrestus.522 The Jews had before been directed to compose a
sacred oil, with which those who were called to the priesthood523 or to the kingdom might
be anointed. And as now the robe of purple524 is a sign of the assumption of royal dignity
among the Romans, so with them the anointing with the holy oil conferred the title and
power of king. But since the ancient Greeks used the word χρίεσθαι to express the art of
anointing, which they now express by ἀλείφεσθαι, as the verse of Homer shows,
<note type="footnote">519 Literally, “whose first nativity not only preceded the world.” He speaks of the eternal generation of the
Son, as distinguished from His incarnation, which he afterwards speaks of as His second nativity. [See vol. vi.

<note type="footnote">522 Suetonius speaks of Christ as Chrestus. The Christians also were called Chrestians, as Tertullian shows
in his Apology. The word χρηστός has the signification of kind, gentle, good. [Vol. i. p. 163.]</note>
<note type="footnote">523 Each has reference to Christ, as He is King and Priest. Of the anointing of kings, see 1 Sam., and of priests,

Hebrews.</note>

on this account we call Him Christ, that is, the Anointed, who in Hebrew is called the
Messias. Hence in some Greek writings, which are badly translated526 from the Hebrew,
the word eleimmenos527 is found written, from the word aleiphesthai,528 anointing. But,
however, by either name a king is signified: not that He has obtained this earthly kingdom,
the time for receiving which has not yet arrived, but that He sways a heavenly and eternal
kingdom, concerning which we shall speak in the last book. But now let us speak of His first
nativity.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS IN THE SPIRIT AND IN THE FLESH: OF
SPIRITS AND THE TESTIMONIES OF PROPHETS.</head>
<p>For we especially testify that He was twice born, first in the spirit, and afterwards in the
flesh. Whence it is thus spoken by Jeremiah:529 “Before I formed Thee in the womb I knew
Thee.” And likewise by the same: “Who was blessed before He was born;”530 which was the
case with no one else but Christ. For though He was the Son of God from the beginning,531
He was born again532 a second time533 according to the flesh: and this twofold birth of His
has introduced great terror into the minds of men, and overspread with darkness even those
who retained the mysteries of true religion. But we will show this plainly and clearly, that
they who love wisdom may be more easily and diligently instructed. He who hears the Son
of God mentioned ought not to conceive in his mind so great impiety as to think that God
begat Him by marriage and union with a woman, which none does but an animal possessed
of a body, and subject to death. But with whom could God unite Himself, since He is alone?
or since His power was so great, that He accomplished whatever He wished, assuredly He
did not require the co-operation534 of another for procreation. Unless by chance we shall
[profanely] imagine, as Orpheus supposed, that God is both male and female, because otherwise
He would have been unable to beget, unless He had the power of each sex, as though
He could have intercourse with Himself, or without such intercourse be unable to produce.</p>
<p>But Hermes also was of the same opinion, when he says that He was “His own father,”
and “His own mother.”535 But if this were so, as He is called by the prophets father, so also
He would be called mother. In what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine
operations cannot be known or declared536 by any one; but nevertheless the sacred writings
teach us, in which it is laid down537 that this Son of God is the speech, or even the reason538
<note type="footnote">529 Jer. i. 5. It can only be in a secondary sense that this prophecy refers to Christ; in its primary sense it

of God, and also that the other angels are spirits539 of God. For speech is breath sent forth
with a voice signifying something. But, however, since breath and speech are sent forth from
different parts, inasmuch as breath proceeds from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the
difference between the Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded from
God as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach540 the knowledge of God, but
for His service. But though He is Himself also a spirit, yet He proceeded from the mouth of
God with voice and sound, as the Word, on this account indeed, because He was about to
make use of His voice to the people; that is, because He was about to be a teacher of the
knowledge of God, and of the heavenly mystery541 to be revealed to man: which word also
God Himself first spoke, that through Him He might speak to us, and that He might reveal
to us the voice and will of God.</p>
<p>With good reason, therefore, is He called the Speech and the Word of God, because
God, by a certain incomprehensible energy and power of His majesty, enclosed the vocal
spirit proceeding from His mouth, which he had not conceived in the womb, but in His
mind, within a form which has life through its own perception and wisdom, and He also
fashioned other spirits of His into angels. Our spirits542 are liable to dissolution, because
we are mortal: but the spirits of God both live, and are lasting, and have perception; because
He Himself is immortal, and the Giver both of perception543 and life. Our expressions, although
they are mingled with the air, and fade away, yet generally remain comprised in
letters; how much more must we believe that the voice of God both remains for ever, and
is accompanied with perception and power, which it has derived from God the Father, as a
stream from its fountain! But if any one wonders that God could be produced from God by
a putting forth of the voice and breath, if he is acquainted with the sacred utterances of the
prophets he will cease to wonder. That Solomon and his father David were most powerful
kings, and also prophets, may perhaps be known even to those who have not applied
themselves to the sacred writings; the one of whom, who reigned subsequently to the other,
preceded the destruction of the city of Troy by one hundred and forty years. His father, the
writer of sacred hymns, thus speaks in the thirty-second Psalm:544 “By the word of God
<note type="footnote">539 There is great difficulty in translating this passage, on account of the double sense of spiritus (as in Greek,
πνευ̑μα), including “spirit” and “breath.” It is impossible to express the sense of the whole passage by either
word singly. There is the same difficulty with regard to πνευ̑μα, as in Heb. i. 7: “He maketh His angels spirits,”
more correctly “winds.” See Delitzsch on Hebrews, and comp. Ps. civ. 4.</note>

were the heavens made firm; and all their power545 by the breath of His mouth.” And also
again in the forty-fourth Psalm:546 “My heart hath given utterance to a good word; I speak
of my doings towards the king;” testifying, in truth, that the works of God are known to no
other than to the Son alone, who is the Word of God, and who must reign for ever. Solomon
also shows that it is the Word of God, and no other,547 by whose hands these works of the
world were made. “I,” He says, “came forth out of the mouth of the Most High before all
creatures: I caused the light that faileth not to arise in the heavens, and covered the whole
earth with a cloud. I have dwelt in the height, and my throne is in the pillar of the cloud.”548
John also thus taught: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him,
and without Him was not anything made.”549</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE WORD OF GOD.</head>
<p>But the Greeks speak of Him as the Logos,550 more befittingly than we do as the word,
or speech: for Logos signifies both speech and reason, inasmuch as He is both the voice and
the wisdom of God. And of this divine speech not even the philosophers were ignorant,
since Zeno represents the Logos as the arranger of the established order of things, and the
framer of the universe: whom also He calls Fate, and the necessity of things, and God, and
the soul of Jupiter, in accordance with the custom, indeed, by which they are wont to regard
Jupiter as God. But the words are no obstacle, since the sentiment is in agreement with the
truth. For it is the spirit of God which he named the soul of Jupiter. For Trismegistus, who
by some means or other searched into almost all truth, often described the excellence and
majesty of the word, as the instance before mentioned declares, in which he acknowledges
that there is an ineffable and sacred speech, the relation of which exceeds the measure of
man’s ability. I have spoken briefly, as I have been able, concerning the first nativity. Now
I must more fully discuss the second, since this is the subject most controverted, that we

<head>CHAP. X.—OF THE ADVENT OF JESUS; OF THE FORTUNES OF THE JEWS, AND
THEIR GOVERNMENT, UNTIL THE PASSION OF THE LORD.</head>
<p>In the first place, then, men ought to know that the arrangements of the Most High God
have so advanced from the beginning, that it was necessary, as the end of the world551 approached,
that the Son of God should descend to the earth, that He might build a temple
for God, and teach righteousness; but, however, not with the might of an angel or with
heavenly power, but in the form of man and in the condition of a mortal, that when He had
discharged the office of His ministry,552 He might be delivered into the hands of wicked
men, and might undergo death, that, having subdued this also by His might, He might rise
again, and bring to man, whose nature He had put on553 and represented, the hope of
overcoming death, and might admit him to the rewards of immortality. And that no one
may be ignorant of this arrangement, we will show that all things were foretold which we
see fulfilled in Christ. Let no one believe our assertion unless I shall show that the prophets
before a long series of ages published that it should come to pass at length that the Son of
God should be born as a man, and perform wonderful deeds, and sow554 the worship of
God throughout the whole earth, and at last be crucified, and on the third day rise again.
And when I shall have proved all these things by the writings of those very men who treated
with violence their God who had assumed a mortal body, what else will prevent it from being
manifest that true wisdom is conversant with this religion only? Now the origin of the whole
mystery is to be related.</p>
<p>Our ancestors,555 who were chiefs of the Hebrews, when they were distressed by famine
and want, passed over into Egypt, that they might obtain a supply of corn; and sojourning
there a long time, they were oppressed with an intolerable yoke of slavery. Then God pitied
them, and led them out, and freed them from the hand of the king of the Egyptians, after
four hundred and thirty556 years, under the leadership of Moses, through whom the law was
<note type="footnote">551 The boundary of the age. Thus the Scriptures speak of the end of the world, the last days.</note>

afterwards given to them by God; and in this leading out God displayed the power of His
majesty. For He made His people to pass through the midst of the Red Sea, His angel557
going before and dividing the water, so that the people might walk over the dry land, of
whom it might more truly be said (as the poet says558), that “the wave, closing over him
after the appearance of a mountain, stood around him.” And when he heard of this, the
tyrant of the Egyptians followed with this great host of his men, and rashly entering the sea
which still lay open, was destroyed, together with his whole army, by the waves returning559
to their place. But the Hebrews, when they had entered into the wilderness, saw many
wonderful deeds. For when they suffered thirst, a rock having been struck with a rod, a
fountain of water sprung forth and refreshed the people. And again, when they were hungry,
a shower560 of heavenly nourishment descended. Moreover, also, the wind561 brought quails
into their camp, so that they were not only satisfied with heavenly bread, but also with more
choice banquets. And yet, in return for these divine benefits, they did not pay honour to
God; but when slavery had been now removed from them, and their thirst and hunger laid
aside, they fell away into luxury, and transferred their minds to the profane rites of the
Egyptians. For when Moses, their leader, had ascended into the mountain, and there tarried
forty days, they made the head562 of an ox in gold, which they call Apis,563 that it might go
before them as a standard.564 With which sin and crime God was offended, and justly visited
the impious and ungrateful people with severe punishments, and made them subject to the
law565 which He had given by Moses.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when they had settled in a desert part of Syria, the Hebrews566 lost their
ancient name; and since the leader of their host567 was Judas, they were called Jews,568 and
109
the land which they inhabited Judæa. And at first, indeed, they were not subject to the
dominion of Kings, but civil Judges presided over the people and the law: they were not,
however, appointed only for a year, as the Roman consuls, but supported by a perpetual
jurisdiction. Then, the name of Judges being taken away, the kingly power was introduced.
But during the government of the Judges the people had often undertaken corrupt religious
rites; and God, offended by them, as often brought them into bondage to strangers, until
again, softened by the repentance of the people, He freed them from bondage. Likewise
under the Kings, being oppressed by wars with their neighbours on account of their
iniquities, and at last taken captive and led to Babylon, they suffered punishment for their
impiety by oppressive slavery, until Cyrus came to the kingdom, who immediately restored
the Jews by an edict. Afterwards they had tetrarchs until the time of Herod, who was in the
reign of Tiberius Cæsar; in whose fifteenth year, in the consulship of the two Gemini, on
the 23d of March,569 the Jews crucified Christ. This series of events, this order, is contained
in the secrets of the sacred writings. But I will first show for what reason Christ came to the
earth, that the foundation and the system of divine religion may be manifest.</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF THE CAUSE OF THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST.</head>
<p>When the Jews often resisted wholesome precepts, and departed from the divine law,
going astray to the impious worship of false gods, then God filled just and chosen men with
the Holy Spirit, appointing them as prophets in the midst of the people, by whom He might
rebuke with threatening words the sins of the ungrateful people, and nevertheless exhort
them to repent of their wickedness; for unless they did this, and, laying aside their vanities,
return to their God, it would come to pass that He would change His covenant,570 that is,
bestow571 the inheritance of eternal life upon foreign nations, and collect to Himself a more
faithful people out of those who were aliens572 by birth. But they, when rebuked by the
prophets, not only rejected their words; but being offended because they were upbraided
for their sins, they slew the prophets themselves with studied573 tortures: all which things
are sealed up and preserved in the sacred writings. For the prophet Jeremiah says:574 “I sent
to you my servants the prophets; I sent them before the morning light; but ye did not hearken,
nor incline your ears to hear, when I spake unto you: let every one of you turn from his evil
way, and from your most corrupt affections; and ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to
you and to your fathers for ever.575 Walk ye not after strange gods, to serve them; and provoke
me not to anger with the works of your hands, that I should destroy you.” The
prophet Ezra576 also, who was in the times of the same Cyrus by whom the Jews were restored,
thus speaks: “They rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their backs, and
slew Thy prophets which testified against them, that they might turn unto Thee.”</p>
<p>The prophet Elias also, in the third book of Kings:577 “I have been very jealous578 for
the Lord God of hosts, because the children of Israel have forsaken Thee, thrown down
Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I only am left, and they seek my
life to take it away.” On account of these impieties of theirs He cast them off for ever;579

and so He ceased to send to them prophets. But He commanded His own Son, the first-begotten,
580 the maker of all things, His own counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He
might transfer the sacred religion of God to the Gentiles,581 that is, to those who were ignorant
of God, and might teach them righteousness, which the perfidious people had cast aside.
And He had long before threatened that He would do this, as the prophet Malachi582 shows,
saying: “I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, and I will not accept an offering from
your hands; for from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, my name shall be great583
among the Gentiles.” David also in the seventeenth Psalm584 says: “Thou wilt make me the
head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.” Isaiah585 also thus
speaks: “I come to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory;
and I will send among them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations
which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and they shall declare my glory among
the Gentiles.” Therefore, when God wished to send to the earth one who should measure586
His temple, He was unwilling to send him with heavenly power and glory, that the people
who had been ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest error, and suffer punishment
for their crimes, since they had not received their Lord and God, as the prophets
had before foretold that it would thus happen. For Isaiah whom the Jews most cruelly slew,
cutting him asunder with a saw,587 thus speaks:588 “Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth:
for the Lord hath spoken, I have begotten sons, and lifted589 them up on high, and they
have rejected me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s stall; but Israel hath
not known, my people has not understood.” Jeremiah also says, in like manner:590 “The
turtle and the swallow hath known her time, and the sparrows of the field have observed591

the times of their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord. How
do you say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? The meting out592 is in vain;
the scribes are deceived and confounded: the wise men are dismayed and taken, for they
have rejected the word of the Lord.”</p>
<p>Therefore (as I had begun to say), when God had determined to send to men a teacher
of righteousness, He commanded Him to be born again a second time in the flesh, and to
be made in the likeness of man himself, to whom he was about to be a guide, and companion,
and teacher. But since God is kind and merciful593 to His people, He sent Him to those very
persons whom He hated,594 that He might not close the way of salvation against them for
ever, but might give them a free opportunity of following God, that they might both gain
the reward of life if they should follow Him (which many of them do, and have done), and
that they might incur the penalty of death by their fault if they should reject their King. He
ordered Him therefore to be born again among them, and of their seed, lest, if He should
be born of another nation, they might be able to allege a just excuse from the law for their
rejection of Him; and at the same time, that there might be no nation at all under heaven
to which the hope of immortality should be denied.</p>

<head>CHAP. XII.—OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS FROM THE VIRGIN; OF HIS LIFE, DEATH,
AND RESURRECTION, AND THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROPHETS RESPECTING
THESE THINGS.</head>
<p>Therefore the Holy Spirit of God, descending from heaven, chose the holy Virgin, that
He might enter into her womb.595 But she, being filled by the possession596 of the Divine
Spirit, conceived; and without any intercourse with a man, her virgin womb was suddenly
impregned. But if it is known to all that certain animals are accustomed to conceive597 by
the wind and the breeze, why should any one think it wonderful when we say that a virgin
was made fruitful by the Spirit of God, to whom whatever He may wish is easy? And this
might have appeared incredible, had not the prophets many ages previously foretold its
occurrence. Thus Solomon speaks:598 “The womb of a virgin was strengthened, and conceived;
and a virgin was made fruitful, and became a mother in great pity.” Likewise the
prophet Isaiah,599 whose words are these: “Therefore God Himself shall give you a sign:
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.” What
can be more manifest than this? This was read by the Jews, who denied Him. If any one
thinks that these things are invented by us, let him inquire of them, let him take especially
from them: the testimony is sufficiently strong to prove the truth, when it is alleged by enemies
themselves. But He was never called Emmanuel, but Jesus, who in Latin is called
Saving, or Saviour,600 because He comes bringing salvation to all nations. But by this name
the prophet declared that God incarnate was about to come to men. For Emmanuel signifies
God with us; because when He was born of a virgin, men ought to confess that God was
with them, that is, on the earth and in mortal flesh. Whence David601 says in the eightyfourth
Psalm, “Truth has sprung out of the earth;” because God, in whom is truth, hath
taken a body of earth, that He might open a way of salvation to those of the earth. In like
manner Isaiah also:602 “But they disbelieved, and vexed His Holy Spirit; and He was turned
to be their enemy. And He Himself fought against them, and He remembered the days of

old,603 who raised up from the earth a shepherd of the sheep.” But who this shepherd was
about to be, he declared in another place,604 saying: “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
clouds put on righteousness; let the earth open, and put forth a Saviour. For I the Lord have
begotten Him.” But the Saviour is, as we have said before, Jesus. But in another place the
same prophet also thus proclaimed:605 “Behold, unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
given, whose dominion is upon His shoulders, and His name is called Messenger of great
counsel.” For on this account He was sent by God the Father, that He might reveal to all the
nations which are under heaven the sacred mystery of the only true God, which was taken
away from the perfidious people, who ofttimes sinned against God. Daniel also foretold
similar things:606 “I saw,” he said, “in a vision of the night, and, behold, one like the Son of
man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of days. And they
who stood by brought Him near607 before Him. And there was given unto Him a kingdom,
and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him: and His
dominion is everlasting, which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”
How then do the Jews both confess and expect the Christ of God? who rejected
Him on this account, because He was born of man. For since it is so arranged by God that
the same Christ should twice come to the earth, once to announce to the nations the one
God, then again to reign, why do they who did not believe in His first advent believe in the
second?</p>
<p>But the prophet comprises both His advents in few words. Behold, he says, one like the
Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He did not say, like the Son of God, but the
Son of man, that he might show that He had608 to be clothed with flesh on the earth, that
having assumed the form of a man and the condition of mortality, He might teach men
righteousness; and when, having completed the commands of God, He had revealed the
truth to the nations, He might also suffer death, that He might overcome and lay open609
the other world also, and thus at length rising again, He might proceed to His Father borne
aloft on a cloud.610 For the prophet said in addition: And came even to the Ancient of days,
<note type="footnote">603 The days of the age. In the next clause the text differs both from the Hebrew and the Septuagint—which
the English authorized version follows—“who raised up out of the sea.”</note>

and was presented to Him. He called the Most High God the Ancient of days, whose age
and origin cannot be comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be
always to generations.611 But that Christ, after His passion and resurrection, was about to
ascend to God the Father, David bore witness in these words in the cixth Psalm:612 “The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”
Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat at the right
hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords? And this
is more plainly shown by Isaiah,613 when he says: “Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord
Christ, whose right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will break
the strength of kings. I will open before Him gates, and the cities shall not be closed. I will
go before Thee, and will make the mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of
brass, and shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible treasures,
that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call Thee by Thy name, the God of
Israel.” Lastly, on account of the goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards
God on earth, there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people,
tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is everlasting, and that which shall
never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two
ways: that even now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages
adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate His goodness: He
has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth obey His precepts. And also, when He
shall come again with majesty and glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to
life, then He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil having been
removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets call it), that is, a time of righteousness
and peace, will arise. But we will speak of these things more fully in the last book,
when we shall speak of His second advent; now let us treat of His first advent, as we began.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIII.—OF JESUS, GOD AND MAN; AND THE TESTIMONIES OF THE
PROPHETS CONCERNING HIM.</head>
<p>Therefore the Most High God, and Parent of all, when He had purposed to transfer614
His religion, sent from heaven a teacher of righteousness, that in Him or through Him He
might give a new law to new worshippers; not as He had before done, by the instrumentality
of man. Nevertheless it was His pleasure that He should be born as a man, that in all things
He might be like His supreme Father. For God the Father Himself, who is the origin and
source of all things, inasmuch as He is without parents, is most truly named by Trismegistus
“fatherless” and “motherless,”615 because He was born from no one. For which reason it
was befitting that the Son also should be twice born, that He also might become “fatherless”
and “motherless.” For in His first nativity, which was spiritual, He was “motherless,” because
He was begotten by God the Father alone, without the office of a mother. But in His second,
which was in the flesh, He was born of a virgin’s womb without the office of a father, that,
bearing a middle substance between God and man, He might be able, as it were, to take by
the hand this frail and weak nature of ours, and raise it to immortality. He became both the
Son of God through the Spirit, and the Son of man through the flesh,—that is, both God
and man. The power of God was displayed in Him, from the works which He performed;
the frailty of the man, from the passion which He endured: on what account He undertook
it I will mention a little later. In the meantime, we learn from the predictions of the prophets
that He was both God and man—composed616 of both natures. Isaiah testifies that He was
God in these words:617 “Egypt is wearied,618 and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the
Sabæans, men of stature, shall come over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants: and they
shall walk behind Thee; in chains they shall fall down unto Thee, and shall make supplication
unto Thee, Since God is in Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee. For Thou art God,
and we knew Thee not, the God of Israel, the Saviour. They shall all be confounded and
ashamed who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion.” In like manner the prophet
Jeremiah619 thus speaks: “This is our God, and there shall none other be compared unto
<note type="footnote">614 From the Israelites, to whom He first revealed Himself, to the Gentile world at large.</note>
<note type="footnote">615 ἀπάτωρ and ἀμήτωρ. See Heb. vii. 3, where Melchisedec is a type of Christ.</note>
<note type="footnote">616 Ex utroque genere permistum. Though the Godhead and the manhood are joined together in one person
in our Lord Jesus Christ, there is no confounding of the two natures: each is whole and perfect. While Nestorius
held that there were two persons in Christ, Eutyches fell into the opposite error, and taught that the two natures
were so blended together as to form one mixed nature. The expression in the text is not very clear.</note>

Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant,
and to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men.”</p>
<p>David also, in the forty-fourth Psalm:620 “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a
sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and
hated wickedness; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness.”
By which word he also shows His name, since (as I have shown above) He was called Christ
from His anointing. Then, that He was also man, Jeremiah teaches, saying:621 “And He is
a man, and who hath known Him?” Also Isaiah:622 “And God shall send to them a man,
who shall save them, shall save them by judging.” But Moses also, in Numbers,623 thus
speaks: “There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man624 shall spring forth from Israel.”
On which account the Milesian Apollo,625 being asked whether He was God or man, replied
in this manner: “He was mortal as to His body, being wise with wondrous works; but being
taken with arms under Chaldean judges, with nails and the cross He endured a bitter end.”
In the first verse he spoke the truth, but he skilfully deceived him who asked the question,
who was entirely ignorant of the mystery of the truth. For he appears to have denied that
He was God. But when he acknowledges that He was mortal as to the flesh, which we also
declare, it follows that as to the spirit He was God, which we affirm. For why would it have
been necessary to make mention of the flesh, since it was sufficient to say that He was
mortal? But being pressed by the truth, he could not deny the real state of the case; as that
which he says, that He was wise.</p>
<p>What do you reply to this, Apollo? If he is wise, then his system of instruction is wisdom,
and no other; and they are wise who follow it, and no others. Why then are we commonly
esteemed as foolish, and visionary, and senseless, who follow a Master who is wise even by
the confession of the gods themselves? For in that he said that He wrought wonderful deeds,
by which He especially claimed faith is His divinity, he now appears to assent to us, when
he says the same things in which we boast. But, however, he recovers himself, and again has
recourse to demoniacal frauds. For when he had been compelled to speak the truth, he now
appeared to be a betrayer of the gods and of himself, unless he had, by a deceptive falsehood,

concealed that which the truth had extorted from him. He says, therefore, that He did indeed
perform wonderful works, yet not by divine power, but by magic. What wonder if Apollo
thus persuaded men ignorant of the truth, when the Jews also, worshippers (as they seemed
to be) of the Most High God, entertained the same opinion, though they had every day before
their eyes those miracles which the prophets had foretold to them as about to happen, and
yet they could not be induced by the contemplation of such powers to believe that He whom
they saw was God? On this account, David, whom they especially read above the other
prophets, in the twenty-seventh Psalm626 thus condemns them: “Render to them their
desert, because they regard not the works of the Lord.” Both David himself and other
prophets announced that of the house of this very David, Christ should be born according
to the flesh. Thus it is written in Isaiah:627 “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,
and He who shall arise to rule over the nations, in Him shall the Gentiles trust; and His rest
shall be glorious.” And in another place:628 “There shall come forth a rod out of the stem
of Jesse, and a blossom629 shall grow out of his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon
Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit
of knowledge and of piety; and He shall be filled630 with the spirit of fear of the Lord.” Now
Jesse was the father of David, from whose root he foretold that a blossom would arise; namely
him of whom the Sibyl speaks, “A pure blossom shall spring forth.”</p>
<p>Also in the second book of Kings, the prophet Nathan was sent to David, who wished
to build a temple for God; and this was the word of the Lord to Nathan, saying:631 “Go and
tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Thou shall not build me a house for
me to dwell in; but when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will
raise up thy seed after thee, and I will establish His kingdom. He shall build me a house for
my name, and I will set up His throne for ever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He
shall be to me for a son; and His house shall be established,632 and His kingdom for ever.”
But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was this, because Solomon the
son of David built a temple for God, and the city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem.
633 Therefore they referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon

never called the son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not
firmly established,634 as the Church, which is the true temple of God, which does not consist
of walls, but of the heart635 and faith of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful.
But that temple of Solomon, inasmuch as it was built by the hand, fell by the hand. Lastly,
his father, in the cxxvith Psalm, prophesied in this manner respecting the works of his son:636
“Except the Lord build the house, they have laboured in vain that built it; except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman hath waked but in vain.”</p>

<head>CHAP. XIV.—OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF JESUS FORETOLD BY THE PROPHETS.</head>
<p>From which things it is evident that all the prophets declared concerning Christ, that
it should come to pass at some time, that being born with a body637 of the race of David,
He should build an eternal temple in honour of God, which is called the Church, and assemble
all nations to the true worship of God. This is the faithful house, this is the everlasting
temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he will not have the reward of immortality.
And since Christ was the builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an
everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the temple, and
to the sight of God, except through Him who built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm
teaches the same, saying:638 “Before the morning-star I begat Thee. The Lord hath sworn,
and will not repent; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.” Also in the
first book of Kings:639 “And I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do all things that
are in mine heart; and I will build him a sure640 house; and he shall walk in my sight641 all
his days.” But who this was about to be, to whom God promised an everlasting priesthood,
Zechariah most plainly teaches, even mentioning His name:642 “And the Lord God showed
me Jesus643 the great Priest standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and the adversary644
was standing at His right hand to resist Him. And the Lord said unto the adversary,
The Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; and lo, a brand plucked out of the fire.
And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments, and He was standing before the face of the angel.
And He answered and spake unto those that stood around before His face, saying, Take
away the filthy garments from Him, and clothe Him with a flowing645 garment, and place
a fair mitre646 upon His head; and they clothed Him with a garment, and placed a fair mitre
upon His head. And the angel of the Lord stood, and protested, saying to Jesus: Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, If Thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, Thou shalt judge

stand by. Hear, therefore, O Jesus, Thou great Priest.”</p>
<p>Who, therefore, would not believe that the Jews were then deprived of understanding,
who, when they read and heard these things, laid impious hands upon their God? But from
the time in which Zechariah lived, until the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, in
which Christ was crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished in
the time of Darius and Alexander,647 who lived not long after the banishment of Tarquinius
Superbus. But they were again misled and deceived in the same manner, in supposing that
these things were spoken concerning Jesus648 the son of Nave, who was the successor of
Moses, or concerning Jesus the high priest the son of Josedech; to whom none of those
things which the prophet related was suited. For they were never clothed in filthy garments,
since one of them was a most powerful prince, and the other high priest; or suffered any
adversity, so that they should be regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they
ever stand in the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet speak of the past so
much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of Jesus the Son of God, to show that He would
first come in humility and in the flesh. For this is the filthy garment, that He might prepare
a temple for God, and might be scorched649 as a brand with fire—that is, might endure
tortures from men, and at last be extinguished. For a half-burnt brand drawn forth from
the hearth and extinguished, is commonly so called.650 But in what manner and with what
commands He was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared through the prophet,
teaching us that when He had faithfully and uniformly fulfilled the will of His supreme
Father, He should receive judgment651 and an everlasting dominion. If, He says, Thou wilt
walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, then Thou shalt judge my house. What these ways
of God were, and what His precepts, is neither doubtful nor obscure. For God, when He
saw that wickedness and the worship of false gods had so prevailed throughout the world,
that His name had now also been taken away from the memory of men (since even the Jews,
who alone had been entrusted with the secret of God, had deserted the living God, and,
ensnared by the deceits of demons, had gone astray, and turned aside to the worship of
images, and when rebuked by the prophets did not choose to return to God), He sent His
Son652 as an ambassador to men, that He might turn them from their impious and vain

worship to the knowledge and worship of the true God; and also that He might turn their
minds from foolishness to wisdom, and from wickedness to deeds of righteousness. These
are the ways of God, in which He enjoined Him to walk. These are the precepts which He
ordered to be observed. But He exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but
one God, and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say that He
Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His faithfulness, if, when sent to abolish
the false gods, and to assert the existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides
that one. This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work of Him who
sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself, and to separate Himself from Him
whom He came to reveal. On which account, because He was so faithful, because He arrogated
nothing at all to Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him,
He received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honour of supreme King, and the authority
of Judge, and the name of God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XV.—OF THE LIFE AND MIRACLES OF JESUS, AND TESTIMONIES
CONCERNING THEM.</head>
<p>Having spoken of the second nativity, in which, He showed Himself in the flesh to men,
let us come to those wonderful works, on account of which, though they were signs of
heavenly power, the Jews esteemed Him a magician. When He first began to reach maturity653
He was baptized by the prophet John in the river Jordan, that He might wash654 away
in the spiritual laver not His own sins, for it is evident that He had none, but those of the
flesh,655 which He bare; that as He saved the Jews by undergoing circumcision, so He might
save the Gentiles also by baptism—that is, by the pouring forth656 of the purifying dew.
Then a voice from heaven was heard: “Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten Thee.”657
Which voice is found to have been foretold by David. And the Spirit of God descended upon
Him, formed after the appearance of a white dove.658 From that time He began to perform
the greatest miracles, not by magical tricks, which display nothing true and substantial, but
by heavenly strength and power, which were foretold even long ago by the prophets who
announced Him; which works are so many, that a single book is not sufficient to comprise
them all. I will therefore enumerate them briefly and generally, without any designation of
persons and places, that I may be able to come to the setting forth of His passion and cross,
to which my discourse has long been hastening. His powers were those which Apollo called
wonderful:659 that wherever He journeyed, by a single word, and in a single moment, He
healed the sick and infirm, and those afflicted with every kind of disease: so that those who
were deprived of the use of all their limbs, having suddenly received power, were
strengthened, and themselves carried their couches, on which they had a little time before
been carried. But to the lame, and to those afflicted with some defect660 of the feet, He not
only gave the power of walking, but also of running. Then, also, if any had their eyes blinded
in the deepest darkness, He restored them to their former sight. He also loosened the tongues
of the dumb, so that661 they discoursed and spake eloquently. He also opened the ears of
<note type="footnote">653 Cum primus coepit adolescere.</note>

<note type="footnote">655 Not of His own flesh, but of human nature. Our Lord Himself gives a better explanation of His baptism,

righteousness” (Matt. iii. 15).</note>

the deaf, and caused them to hear;662 He cleansed the polluted and the blemished.663 And
He performed all these things not by His hands, or the application of any remedy,664 but
by His word and command, as also the Sibyl had foretold: “Doing all things by His word,
and healing every disease.”</p>
<p>Nor, indeed, is it wonderful that He did wonderful things by His word, since He Himself
was the Word of God, relying upon heavenly strength and power. Nor was it enough that
He gave strength to the feeble, soundness of body to the maimed, health to the sick and
languishing, unless He also raised the dead, as it were unbound from sleep, and recalled
them to life.</p>
<p>And the Jews, then, when they saw these things, contended that they were done by demoniacal
power, although it was contained in their secret writings that all things should
thus come to pass as they did. They read indeed the words of other prophets, and of Isaiah,665
saying: “Be strong, ye hands that are relaxed; and ye weak knees, be comforted. Ye who are
of a fearful666 heart, fear not, be not afraid: our Lord shall execute judgment; He Himself
shall come and save us. Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf
shall hear: then shall the lame man leap as a deer, and the tongue of the dumb speak
plainly:667 for in the wilderness water hath broken forth, and a stream in the thirsty land.”
But the Sibyl also foretold the same things in these verses:—
<lg>
<l>“And there shall be a rising again of the dead; and the course of the lame shall
be swift, and the deaf shall hear, and the blind shall see, the dumb shall
speak.”</l>
</lg>
On account of these powers and divine works wrought by Him when a great multitude followed
Him of the maimed, or sick, or of those who desired to present their sick to be healed,
He went up into a desert mountain to pray there. And when He had tarried there three days,
and the people were suffering from hunger, He called His disciples, and asked what quantity
of food668 they had with them. But they said that they had five loaves and two fishes in a
wallet. Then He commanded that these should be brought forward, and that the multitude,
distributed by fifties, should recline on the ground. When the disciples did this, He Himself

<pb n="253"/>
broke the bread in pieces, and divided the flesh of the fishes, and in His hands both of them
were increased. And when He had ordered the disciples to set them before the people, five
thousand men were satisfied, and moreover twelve baskets669 were filled from the fragments
which remained. What can be more wonderful, either in narration or in action? But the
Sibyl had before foretold that it would take place, whose verses are related to this effect:—
<lg>
<l>“With five loaves at the same time, and with two fishes,</l>
<l>He shall satisfy five thousand men in the wilderness;</l>
<l>And afterwards taking all the fragments that remain,</l>
<l>He shall fill twelve baskets to the hope of many.”</l>
</lg>
I ask, therefore, what the art of magic could have contrived in this case, the skill of which is
of avail for nothing else than for deceiving670 the eyes? He also, when He was about to retire
to a mountain, as He was wont, for the sake of prayer, directed His disciples to take a small
ship and go before Him. But they, setting out when evening was now coming on, began to
be distressed671 through a contrary wind. And when they were now in the midst of the
sea,672 then, setting His feet on the sea,673 He came up to them, walking as though on the
solid ground,674 not as the poets fable Orion walking on the sea, who, while a part of his
body was sunk in the water,
<lg>
<l>“With his shoulder rises above the waves.”675</l>
</lg>
And again, when He had gone to sleep in the ship, and the wind had begun to rage, even to
the extremity of danger, being aroused from sleep, He immediately ordered the wind to be
silent; and the waves, which were borne with great violence, were still, and immediately at
His word there followed a calm.</p>
<p>But perhaps the sacred writings676 speak falsely, when they teach that there was such
power in Him, that by His command He compelled the winds to obey, the seas to serve
<note type="footnote">669 Cophini. This miracle is always distinguished from the feeding of the four thousand by the use of this
word. Thus Juvenal: “Judæis, quorum cophinus, foenumque supellex.”</note>

<pb n="254"/>
Him, diseases to depart, the dead to be submissive. Why should I say that the Sibyls before
taught the same things in their verses? one of whom, already mentioned, thus speaks:—
<lg>
<l>“He shall still the winds by His word, and calm the sea</l>
<l>As it rages, treading with feet of peace and in faith.”</l>
</lg>
And again another, which says:—
<lg>
<l>“He shall walk on the waves, He shall release men from disease.</l>
<l>He shall raise the dead, and drive away many pains;</l>
<l>And from the bread of one wallet there shall be a satisfying of men.”</l>
</lg>
Some, refuted by these testimonies, are accustomed to have recourse to the assertion that
these poems were not by the Sibyls, but made up and composed by our own writers. But he
will assuredly not think this who has read Cicero,677 and Varro, and other ancient writers,
who make mention of the Erythræan and the other Sibyls, from whose books we bring forward
these examples; and these authors died before the birth of Christ according to the
flesh. But I do not doubt that these poems were in former times regarded as ravings, since
no one then understood them. For they announced some marvellous wonders, of which
neither the manner, nor the time, nor the author was signified. Lastly, the Erythræan Sibyl
says that it would come to pass that she would be called mad and deceitful. But assuredly
<lg>
<l>“They will say that the Sibyl</l>
<l>Is mad, and deceitful: but when all things shall come to pass,</l>
<l>Then ye will remember me; and no one will any longer</l>
<l>Say that I, the prophetess of the great God, am mad.”</l>
</lg>
Therefore they were678 neglected for many ages; but they received attention after the
nativity and passion of Christ had revealed secret things. Thus it was also with the utterances
of the prophets, which were read by the people of the Jews for fifteen hundred years and
more, but yet were not understood until after Christ had explained679 them both by His
word and by His works. For the prophets spoke of Him; nor could the things which they
said have been in any way understood, unless they had been altogether fulfilled.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—OF THE PASSION OF JESUS CHRIST; THAT IT WAS FORETOLD.</head>
<p>I come now to the passion itself, which is often cast in our teeth as a reproach:680 that
we worship a man, and one who was visited and tormented with remarkable punishment:
that I may show that this very passion was undergone by Him in accordance with a great
and divine plan, and that goodness and truth and wisdom are contained in it alone. For if
He had been most happy on the earth, and had reigned through all His life in the greatest
prosperity, no wise man would either have believed Him to be a God, or judged Him worthy
of divine honour: which is the case with those who are destitute of true divinity, who not
only look up681 to perishable riches, and frail power, and the advantages arising from the
benefit of another, but even consecrate them, and knowingly do service to the memory of
the dead, worshipping fortune when it is now extinguished, which the wise never regarded
as an object of worship even when alive and present with them. For nothing among earthly
things can be venerable and worthy of heaven; but it is virtue alone, and justice alone, which
can be judged a true, and heavenly, and perpetual good, because it is neither given to any
one, nor taken away. And since Christ came upon earth, supplied with virtue and righteousness,
yea rather, since He Himself is virtue, and Himself righteousness, He descended that
He might teach it and mould the character of man. And having performed this office and
embassy from God, on account of this very virtue which He at once taught and practised,
He deserved, and was able, to be believed a God by all nations. Therefore, when a great
multitude from time to time flocked to Him, either on account of the righteousness which
He taught or on account of the miracles which He worked, and heard His precepts, and
believed that He was sent by God, and that He was the Son of God, then the rulers and
priests of the Jews, excited with anger because they were rebuked by Him as sinners, and
perverted by envy, because, while the multitude flocked to Him, they saw themselves despised
and deserted, and (that which was the crowning point of their guilt) blinded by folly and
error, and unmindful of the instructors sent from heaven, and of the prophets, they caballed
against Him, and conceived the impious design of putting Him to death, and torturing Him:
of which the prophets had long before written.</p>
<p>For both David, in the beginning of his Psalms, foreseeing in spirit what a crime they
were about to commit, says,682 “Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the way of the
ungodly; “and Solomon in the book of Wisdom used these words:683 “Let us defraud the
righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our offences against the law.
He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge of God; and he calleth himself the Son of
<note type="footnote">680 The pagans upbraided Christians, that they worshipped a man who was put to d eath as a slave.</note>
<note type="footnote">681 Suspiciunt, “view with admiration.”</note>

<note type="footnote">683 Wisd. ii. 12–22.</note>

<pb n="256"/>
God. He is made to reprove684 our thoughts: it grieveth us even to look upon him: for his
life is not like the life of others; his ways are of another fashion.685 We are counted by him
as triflers,686 he withdraweth himself from our ways as from filthiness; he commendeth
greatly687 the latter end of the just, and boasteth that he has God for his Father. Let us see,
therefore, if his words be true; let us prove what end688 he shall have; let us examine him
with rebukes and torments that we may know his meekness,689 and prove his patience; let
us condemn him to a shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone astray.
For their own folly hath blinded them, and they do not understand the mysteries690 of God.”
Does he not describe that impious design entered into by the wicked against God, so that
he clearly appears to have been present? But from Solomon, who foretold these things, to
the time of their accomplishment, ten hundred and ten years intervened. We feign nothing;
we add nothing. They who performed the actions had these accounts; they, against whom
these things were spoken, read them. But even now the inheritors of their name and guilt
have these accounts, and in their daily readings re-echo their own condemnation as foretold
by the voice of the prophets; nor do they ever admit them into their heart, which is also itself
a part of their condemnation. The Jews, therefore, being often reproved by Christ, who upbraided
them with their sins and iniquities, and being almost deserted by the people, were
stirred up to put Him to death.</p>
<p>Now His humility emboldened them to this deed. For when they read with what great
power and glory the Son of God was about to descend from heaven, but on the other hand
saw Jesus humble, peaceful, of low condition,691 without comeliness, they did not believe
that He was the Son of God, being ignorant that two advents on His part were foretold by
the prophets: the first, obscure in humility of the flesh; the other, manifest in the power of
His majesty. Of the first David thus speaks in the seventy-first Psalm:692 “He shall descend
as rain upon a fleece; and in His days shall righteousness spring forth, and abundance of
peace, as long as the moon is lifted up.” For as rain, if it descends upon a fleece, cannot be
perceived, because it makes no sound; so he said that Christ would come to the earth without

exciting the notice693 of any, that He might teach righteousness and peace. Isaiah also thus
spoke:694 “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
We made proclamation695 before Him as children, and as a root in a thirsty land: He has
no form nor glory; and we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness. But His form was
without honour, and defective beyond the rest of men. He is a man acquainted696 with grief,
and knowing how to endure infirmity, because He turned697 His face away from us; and
He was not esteemed. He carries our sins, and He endures pain for us: and we thought that
He Himself698 was in pain, and grief, and vexation. But He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised699 for our offences; the chastisement700 of our peace was upon Him,
by His bruises701 we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, and God hath delivered
Him up for our sins.” And in the same manner the Sibyl spoke: “Though an object of pity,
dishonoured, without form, He will give hope to those who are objects of pity.” On account
of this humility they did not recognise their God, and entered into the detestable design of
depriving Him of life, who had come to give them life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE JEWS, AND THEIR HATRED
AGAINST JESUS.</head>
<p>But they alleged other causes for their anger and envy, which they bore shut up702
within in their hearts—namely, that He destroyed the obligation703 of the law given by
Moses; that is, that He did not rest704 on the Sabbath, but laboured for the good705 of men;
that He abolished circumcision; that He took away the necessity of abstaining from the flesh
of swine;706—in which things the mysteries of the Jewish religion consist. On this account,
therefore, the rest of the people, who had not yet withdrawn707 to Christ, were incited by
the priests to regard Him as impious, because He destroyed the obligation of the law of God,
though He did this not by His own judgment, but according to the will of God, and after
the predictions of the prophets. For Micah announced that He would give a new law, in
these terms:708 “The law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations.”709 For the former
law, which was given by Moses, was not given on Mount Zion, but on Mount Horeb;710
and the Sibyl shows that it would come to pass that this law would be destroyed by the Son
of God:—
<lg>
<l>“But when all these things which I told you shall be accomplished, then all the
law is fulfilled with respect to Him.”</l>
</lg>
But even Moses himself, by whom the law was given which they so tenaciously maintain,
though they have fallen away from God, and have not acknowledged God, had foretold that
it would come to pass that a very great prophet would be sent by God, who should be above

as Ex. xix. The difficulty of discriminating the two is very great. See Stanley’s Sinai and Palestine [pp. 29, 32,

the law, and be a bearer of the will of God to men. In Deuteronomy he thus left it written:711
“And the Lord said unto me, I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
unto thee; and I will put my word in His mouth, and He shall speak unto them all that I
shall command Him. And whosoever will not hearken to those things which that Prophet
shall speak in my name, I will require712 it of him.” The Lord evidently announced by the
law-giver himself that He was about to send His own Son—that is, a law alive, and present713
in person, and destroy that old law given by a mortal,714 that by Him who was eternal He
might ratify afresh a law which was eternal.</p>
<p>In like manner, Isaiah715 thus prophesied concerning the abolition of circumcision:
“Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah who dwell at Jerusalem, Break up your fallow
ground, and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take
away the foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can
quench it.” Also Moses himself says:716 “In the last days the Lord shall circumcise thine
heart to love the Lord thy God.” Also Jesus717 the son of Nun, his successor, said: “And the
Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children
of Israel the second time.” He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh,
as the first was, which the Jews practice even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was
delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, “And the Lord
said unto me,” but “unto Jesus,” that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but
of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented718 Christ: for when
he was at first called Auses,719 Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called
Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare against Amalek, who was
the enemy of the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem720
of the name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also

successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by Christ Jesus was about to succeed to
the old law which was given by Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational;
since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he
should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that
the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart,
since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and
is to be treated with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that
by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden721 in obscurity; that
is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is the circumcision
of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to
the soul, which alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation
in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set before us
repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,—that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction
to God,—we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal
their faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the innermost
secrets of the heart.722</p>
<p>The forbidding of the flesh of swine also has the same intention; for when God commanded
them to abstain from this, He willed that this should be especially understood, that
they should abstain from sins and impurities. For this animal is filthy and unclean,723 and
never looks up to heaven,724 but prostrates itself to the earth with its whole body and face:
it is always the slave of its appetite and food; nor during its life can it afford any other service,
as the other animals do, which either afford a vehicle for riding,725 or aid in the cultivation
of the fields, or draw waggons by their neck, or carry burthens on their back, or furnish a
covering with their skins,726 or abound with a supply of milk, or keep watch for guarding
our houses. Therefore He forbade them to use the flesh of the pig for food, that is, not to
imitate the life of swine, which are nourished only for death; lest, by devoting themselves
to their appetite and pleasures, they should be useless for working righteousness, and should
be visited with death. Also that they should not immerse themselves in foul lusts, as the sow,

themselves with mud: for they do bedaub themselves with mud who worship gods, that is,
who worship mud and earth. Thus all the precepts of the Jewish law have for their object
the setting forth of righteousness, since they are given in a mysterious728 manner, that under
the figure of carnal things those which are spiritual might be known.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF THE LORD’S PASSION, AND THAT IT WAS FORETOLD.</head>
<p>When, therefore, Christ fulfilled these things which God would have done, and which
He foretold many ages before by His prophets, incited by these things, and ignorant of the
sacred Scriptures, they conspired together to condemn their God. And though He knew
that this would come to pass, and repeatedly729 said that He must suffer and be put to death
for the salvation of many, nevertheless He withdrew Himself with His disciples, not that He
might avoid that which it was necessary for Him to undergo and endure, but that He might
show what ought to take place in every persecution, that no one should appear to have fallen
into it through his own fault: and He announced that it would come to pass that He should
be betrayed by one of them. And thus Judas, induced by a bribe, delivered up to the Jews
the Son of God. But they took and brought Him before Pontius Pilate, who at that time was
administering the province of Syria as governor,730 and demanded that He should be crucified,
though they laid nothing else to His charge except that He said that He was the Son of
God, the King of the Jews; also His own saying,731 “Destroy this temple, which was forty-
six years in building, and in three days I will raise it up again without hands,”—signifying
that His passion would shortly take place, and that He, having been put to death by the Jews,
would rise again on the third day. For He Himself was the true temple of God. They inveighed
against these expressions of His, as ill-omened and impious. And when Pilate had heard
these things, and He said nothing in His own defence, he gave sentence that there appeared
nothing deserving of condemnation in Him. But those most unjust accusers, together with
the people whom they had stirred up, began to cry out, and with loud voices to demand His
crucifixion.</p>
<p>Then Pontius732 was overpowered both by their outcries, and by the instigation of
Herod the tetrarch,733 who feared lest he should be deposed from his sovereignty. He did

province of Syria, which was at this time governed by Silanus.</note>
<note type="footnote">731 John ii. 19, 20. The forty-six years spoken of were not occupied with the rebuilding of the temple, which
was completed in nine years, but with the additional works which Herod the Great and his successors were
continually carrying on for the adorning and beautifying of the temple. See Prideaux. [I regret the loose references
of the translator, and yet more that the inexorable demands of the press give me time to supply only the more

not, however, himself pass sentence, but delivered Him up to the Jews, that they themselves
might judge Him according to their law.734 Therefore they led Him away when He had been
scourged with rods, and before they crucified Him they mocked Him; for they put upon
Him a scarlet735 robe, and a crown of thorns, and saluted Him as King, and gave Him gall
for food, and mingled for Him vinegar to drink. After these things they spat upon His face,
and struck Him with the palms of their hands; and when the executioners736 themselves
contended about His garments, they cast lots among themselves for His tunic and mantle.737
And while all these things were doing, He uttered no voice from His mouth, as though He
were dumb. Then they lifted Him up in the midst between two malefactors, who had been
condemned for robbery, and fixed Him to the cross. What can I here deplore in so great a
crime? or in what words can I lament such great wickedness? For we are not relating the
crucifixion of Gavius,738 which Marcus Tullius followed up with all the spirit and strength
of his eloquence, pouring forth as it were the fountains of all his genius, proclaiming that it
was an unworthy deed that a Roman citizen should be crucified in violation of all laws. And
although He was innocent, and undeserving of that punishment, yet He was put to death,
and that, too, by an impious man, who was ignorant of justice. What shall I say respecting
the indignity of this cross, on which the Son of God was suspended and nailed?739 Who will
be found so eloquent, and supplied with so great an abundance of deeds and words, what
speech flowing with such copious exuberance,740 as to lament in a befitting manner that
cross, which the world itself, and all the elements of the world, bewailed?</p>
<note type="footnote">734 This statement requires some modification. Pilate did indeed say to the Jews, “Take ye Him, and judge
Him according to your law;” but they declared that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death. The
punishment was entirely Roman, the mode of death Roman, the executioners Roman soldiers. There were two
distinct trials,—one before the Jewish Sanhedrim on a charge of impiety, the other before the Roman governor
on a charge of treason.</note>

<pb n="264"/>
<p>But that these things were thus about to happen, was announced both by the utterances
of the prophets and by the predictions of the Sibyls. In Isaiah it is found thus written:741 “I
am not rebellious, nor do I oppose: I gave my back to the scourge, and my cheeks to the
hand:742 I turned not away my face from the foulness of spitting.” In like manner David, in
the thirty-fourth Psalm:743 “The abjects744 were gathered together against me,745 and they
knew me not:746 they were dispersed, nor did they feel remorse; they tempted me, and
greatly747 derided me; and they gnashed upon me with their teeth.” The Sibyl also showed
that the same things would happen:—
<lg>
<l>“He shall afterwards come into the hands of the unjust and the faithless; and
they shall inflict on God blows with impure hands, and with polluted
mouths they shall send forth poisonous spittle; and He shall then ab-
solutely748 give His holy back to stripes.”</l>
</lg>
Likewise respecting His silence, which He perseveringly maintained even to His death, Isaiah
thus spoke again:749 “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before the
shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.” And the above-mentioned Sibyl said:—
<lg>
<l>“And being beaten, He shall be silent, lest any one should know what the Word
is, or whence it came, that it may speak with mortals; and He shall
wear the crown of thorns.”</l>
</lg>
But respecting the food and the drink which they offered to Him before they fastened Him
to the cross, David thus speaks in the sixty-eighth Psalm:750 “And they gave me gall for my
<note type="footnote">741 Isa. l. 5, 6, quoted from the Septuagint.</note>
<note type="footnote">742 i.e., of the smiters; Gr. εἰς ῥαπίσματα, “blows with the hand.”</note>

meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” The Sibyl foretold that this also would
happen:—
<lg>
<l>“They gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst vinegar; this inhospitable table
they will show.”</l>
</lg>
And another Sibyl rebukes the land of Judæa in these verses:—
<lg>
<l>“For you, entertaining hurtful thoughts, did not recognise your God sporting751
with mortal thoughts; but crowned Him with a crown of thorns, and
mingled dreadful gall.”</l>
</lg>
Now, that it would come to pass that the Jews would lay hands upon their God, and put
Him to death, these testimonies of the prophets foretold. In Esdras it is thus written:752
“And Ezra said to the people, This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. Consider and let
it come into your heart, that we have to abase Him in a figure; and after these things we will
hope in Him, lest this place be deserted for ever, saith the Lord God of hosts. If you will not
believe Him, nor hear His announcement, ye shall be a derision among the nations.” From
which it appears that the Jews had no other hope, unless they purified themselves from
blood, and put their hopes in that very person whom they denied.753 Isaiah also points out
their deed, and says:754 “In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. Who shall declare
His generation? for His life shall be taken away from the earth; from the transgressions of
my people He was led away to death. And I will give Him the wicked for His burial, and the
rich for His death, because He did no wickedness, nor spoke guile with His mouth.
Wherefore He shall obtain755 many, and shall divide the spoils of the strong; because He
was delivered up to death, and was reckoned among the transgressors; and He bore the sins
of many, and was delivered up on account of their transgressions.” David also, in the ninetythird
Psalm:756 “They will hunt after the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent
blood; and the Lord is become my refuge.” Also Jeremiah:757 “Lord, declare it unto me, and
<note type="footnote">751 παιζοντα. Another reading is πταίοντα, which would imply that they regarded Christ as a transgressor.</note>
<note type="footnote">752 Justin Martyr quotes this passage in his Dialogue with Trypho, and complains that it had been expunged
by the Jews. [See vol. i. p. 234, and remarks of Bishop Kaye, Justin Martyr, p. 44, on passages suppressed by the
Jews.]</note>
<note type="footnote">753 Negaverunt. Another reading is “necaverunt,” they put to death.</note>

I shall know. Then I saw their devices; I was led as an innocent758 lamb to the sacrifice;759
they meditated a plan against me, saying, Come, let us send wood into his bread,760 and let
us sweep away his life from the earth, and his name shall no more be remembered.” Now
the wood761 signifies the cross, and the bread His body; for He Himself is the food and the
life of all who believe in the flesh which He bare, and on the cross upon which He was suspended.</p>
<p>Respecting this, however, Moses himself more plainly spoke to this effect, in Deuteronomy:
762 “And Thy life shall hang763 before Thine eyes; and Thou shall fear day and night,
and shalt have no assurance of Thy life.” And the same again in Numbers:764 “God is not
in doubt as a man, nor does He suffer threats765 as the son of man.” Zechariah also thus
wrote:766 “And they shall look on me, whom they pierced.” Also David in the twenty-first
Psalm:767 “They pierced my hands and my feet; they numbered all my bones; they themselves
looked and stared upon me; they divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture
they did cast lots.” It is evident that the prophet did not speak these things concerning
himself. For he was a king, and never endured these sufferings; but the Spirit of God, who
was about to suffer these things, after ten hundred and fifty years, spoke by him. For this is
the number of years from the reign of David to the crucifixion of Christ. But Solomon also,
his son, who built Jerusalem, prophesied that this very city would perish in revenge for the
sacred cross:768 “But if ye turn away from me, saith the Lord, and will not keep my truth, I

<note type="footnote">760 For the various explanations, see Pole’s Synopsis Some suppose that there is a reference to the corruption
of food by poisonous wood; others that the meaning is a substitution of wood for bread. Another explanation
is, that the word translated bread denotes fruit, as in the English authorized version, “Let us destroy the tree,
with the fruit thereof.” But see Pole on the passage. [Jer xi. 19. Here is a very insufficient note, the typology of
Scripture not being duly observed. Compare Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 166, especially at note 10, which illustrates

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS; AND
THE PREDICTIONS OF THESE EVENTS.</head>
<p>What more can now be said respecting the crime of the Jews, than that they were then
blinded and seized with incurable madness, who read these things daily, and yet neither
understood them, nor were able to be on their guard so as not to do them? Therefore, being
lifted up and nailed to the cross, He cried to the Lord with a loud voice, and of His own accord
gave up His spirit. And at the same hour there was an earthquake; and the veil of the temple,
which separated the two tabernacles, was rent into two parts; and the sun suddenly withdrew
its light, and there was darkness from the sixth772 even to the ninth hour. Of which event
the prophet Amos testifies:773 “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that
the sun shall go down at noon, and the daylight shall be darkened; and I will turn your feasts
into mourning, and your songs into lamentation.” Also Jeremiah:774 “She who brings forth
is affrighted, and vexed in spirit; her sun is gone down while it was yet mid-day; she hath
been ashamed and confounded;775 and the residue of them will I give to the sword in the
sight of their enemies.” And the Sibyl:—
<lg>
<l>“And the veil of the temple shall be rent, and at midday there shall be dark vast
night for three hours,”</l>
</lg>
When these things were done, even by the heavenly prodigies, they were not able to understand
their crime.</p>
<p>But since He had foretold that on the third day He should rise again from the dead,
fearing lest, the body having been stolen by the disciples, and removed, all should believe
that He had risen, and there should be a much greater disturbance among the people, they
took Him down from the cross, and having shut Him up in a tomb, they securely surrounded
it with a guard of soldiers. But on the third day, before light, there was an earthquake, and
the sepulchre was suddenly opened; and the guard, who were astonished and stupefied with
fear, seeing nothing, He came forth uninjured and alive from the sepulchre, and went into
Galilee to seek His disciples: but nothing was found in the sepulchre except the grave-clothes
in which they had enclosed and wrapt His body. Now, that He would not remain in hell,776
but rise again on the third day, had been foretold by the prophets. David says, in the fifteenth

Psalm:777 “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine holy one to
see corruption.” Also in the third Psalm:778 “I laid me down to sleep, and took my rest, and
rose again, for the Lord sustained me.” Hosea also, the first of the twelve prophets, testified
of His resurrection:779 “This my Son is wise, therefore He will not remain in the anguish of
His sons: and I will redeem Him from the power780 of the grave. Where is thy judgment,
O death? or where is thy sting?” The same also in another place:781 “After two days, He will
revive us in the third day.” And therefore the Sibyl said, that after three days’ sleep he would
put an end to death:—
<lg>
<l>“And after sleeping three days, He shall put an end to the fate of death; and then,
releasing Himself from the dead, He shall come to light, first showing
to the called ones the beginning of the resurrection.”</l>
</lg>
For He gained life for us by overcoming death. No hope, therefore, of gaining immortality
is given to man, unless he shall believe on Him, and shall take up that cross to be borne and
endured.</p>

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE DEPARTURE OF JESUS INTO GALILEE AFTER HIS
RESURRECTION; AND OF THE TWO TESTAMENTS, THE OLD AND THE NEW.</head>
<p>Therefore He went into Galilee, for He was unwilling to show Himself to the Jews, lest
He should lead them to repentance, and restore them from their impiety to a sound mind.782
And there He opened to His disciples again assembled the writings of Holy Scripture, that
is, the secrets of the prophets; which before His suffering could by no means be understood,
for they told of Him and of His passion. Therefore Moses, and the prophets also themselves,
call the law which was given to the Jews a testament: for unless the testator shall have died,
a testament cannot be confirmed; nor can that which is written in it be known, because it
is closed and sealed. And thus, unless Christ had undergone death, the testament could not
have been opened; that is, the mystery of God could not have been unveiled783 and understood.</p>
<p>But all Scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded the advent and
passion of Christ—that is, the law and the prophets—is called the Old; but those things
which were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make
use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling
of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death
for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and
disinherited.784 As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things:785 “Behold,
the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament786 to the house of Israel and
the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not
in my testament, and I disregarded787 them, saith the Lord.” Also in another place he says
in like manner:788 “I have forsaken my house, I have given up mine heritage into the hand
of its enemies. Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it hath cried out
against me, therefore have I hated it.” Since the inheritance is His heavenly kingdom, it is
evident that He does not say that He hates the inheritance itself, but the heirs, who have

been ungrateful towards Him, and impious. Mine heritage, he says, is become unto me as
a lion; that is, I am become a prey and a devouring to my heirs, who have slain me as the
flock. It hath cried out against me; that is, they have pronounced against me the sentence
of death and the cross. For that which He said above, that He would make789 a new testament
to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not
perfect;790 but that that which was to be given by Christ would be complete. But it is plain
that the house of Judah does not signify the Jews, whom He casts off, but us, who have been
called by Him out of the Gentiles, and have by adoption succeeded to their place, and are
called sons791 of the Jews, which the Sibyl declares when she says:—
<lg>
<l>“The divine race of the blessed, heavenly Jews.”</l>
</lg>
But what that race was about to be, Isaiah teaches, in whose book the Most High Father
addresses His Son:792 “I the Lord God have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine
hand, and will keep Thee:793 and I have given Thee for a covenant of my race,794 for a light
of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoners from the prison,
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.” When, therefore, we who were in
time past as it were blind, and as it were shut up in the prison of folly, were sitting in darkness,
ignorant of God and of the truth, we have been enlightened by Him, who adopted us by His
testament; and having freed us from cruel chains, and brought us out to the light of wisdom,
He admitted us to the inheritance of His heavenly kingdom.</p>

AND OF THE PREACHING AND ACTIONS OF THE DISCIPLES.</head>
<p>But when He had made arrangements with His disciples for the preaching of the Gospel
and His name, a cloud suddenly surrounded Him, and carried Him up into heaven, on the
fortieth day after His passion, as Daniel had shown that it would be, saying:795 “And, behold,
one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.”
But the disciples, being dispersed through the provinces, everywhere laid the foundations
of the Church, themselves also in the name of their divine796 Master doing many and almost
incredible miracles; for at His departure He had endowed them with power and strength,
by which the system797 of their new announcement might be founded and confirmed. But
He also opened to them all things which were about to happen, which Peter and Paul
preached at Rome; and this preaching being written for the sake of remembrance,798 became
permanent, in which they both declared other wonderful things, and also said that it was
about to come to pass, that after a short time God would send against them a king who
would subdue799 the Jews, and level their cities to the ground, and besiege the people
themselves, worn out with hunger and thirst. Then it should come to pass that they should
feed on the bodies of their own children, and consume one another. Lastly, that they should
be taken captive, and come into the hands of their enemies, and should see their wives most
cruelly harassed before their eyes, their virgins ravished and polluted, their sons torn in
pieces, their little ones dashed to the ground; and lastly, everything laid waste with fire and
sword, the captives banished for ever from their own lands, because they had exulted over
the well-beloved and most approved Son of God. And so, after their decease, when Nero
had put them to death, Vespasian destroyed the name and nation of the Jews, and did all
things which they had foretold as about to come to pass.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—ARGUMENTS OF UNBELIEVERS AGAINST THE INCARNATION
OF JESUS.</head>
<p>I have now confirmed, as I imagine, the things which are thought false and incredible
by those who are not instructed in the true knowledge of heavenly learning. But, however,
that we may refute those also who are too wise, not without injury to themselves, and who
detract from the credit due to divine things, let us disprove their error, that they may at
length perceive that the fact ought to have been as we show that it actually was. And although
with good judges either testimonies are of sufficient weight without arguments, or arguments
without testimonies, we, however, are not content with the one or the other, since we are
supplied with both, that we may not leave room for any one of depraved ingenuity either
to misunderstand or to dispute on the opposite side. They say that it was impossible for
anything to be withdrawn800 from an immortal nature. They say, in short, that it was unworthy
of God to be willing to become man, and to burthen Himself with the infirmity of
flesh; to become subject of His own accord to sufferings, to pain, and death: as though it
had not been easy for Him to show Himself to men without801 the weakness incident to a
body, and to teach them righteousness (if He so wished) with greater authority, as of one
who acknowledged802 Himself to be God. For in that case all would have obeyed the heavenly
precepts, if the influence and power of God enjoining them had been united with them.
Why, then (they say), did He not come as God to teach men? why did He render Himself
so humble and weak, that it was possible for Him both to be despised by men and to be
visited with punishment? why did He suffer violence from those who are weak and mortal?
why did He not repel by strength, or avoid by His divine knowledge,803 the hands of men?
why did He not at least in His very death reveal His majesty? but He was led as one without
strength to trial, was condemned as one who was guilty, was put to death as one who was
mortal. I will carefully refute these things, nor will I permit any one to be in error. For these
things were done by a great and wonderful plan; and he who shall understand this, will not
only cease to wonder that God was tortured by men, but also will easily see that it could not
have been believed that he was God if those very things which he censures had not been
done.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF GIVING PRECEPTS, AND ACTING.</head>
<p>If any one gives to men precepts for living, and moulds the characters of others, I ask
whether he is bound himself to practice the things which he enjoins, or is not bound. If he
shall not do so, his precepts are annulled. For if the things which are enjoined are good, if
they place the life of men in the best condition, the instructor ought not to separate himself
from the number and assemblage of men among whom he acts; and he ought himself to
live in the same manner in which he teaches that men ought to live, lest, by living in another
way, he himself should disparage804 his own precepts, and make his instruction of less value,
if in reality he should relax the obligations of that which he endeavours to establish by his
words. For every one, when he hears another giving precepts, is unwilling that the necessity
of obeying should be imposed upon him, as though the right of liberty were taken from
him. Therefore he answers his teacher in this manner: I am not able to do the things which
you command, for they are impossible. For you forbid me to be angry, you forbid me to
covet, you forbid me to be excited by desire, you forbid me to fear pain or death; but this is
so contrary to nature, that all animals are subject to these affections. Or if you are so entirely
of opinion that it is possible to resist nature, do you yourself practice the things which you
enjoin, that I may know that they are possible? But since you yourself do not practice them,
what arrogance is it, to wish to impose upon a free man laws which you yourself do not
obey! You who teach, first learn; and before you correct the character of others, correct your
own. Who could deny the justice of this answer? Nay! a teacher of this kind will fall into
contempt, and will in his turn be mocked, because he also will appear to mock others.</p>
<p>What, therefore, will that instructor do, if these things shall be objected to him? how
will he deprive the self-willed805 of an excuse, unless he teach them by deeds before their
eyes806 that he teaches things which are possible? Whence it comes to pass, that no one
obeys the precepts of the philosophers.807 For men prefer examples rather than words, because
it is easy to speak, but difficult to accomplish.808 Would to heaven that there were as
many who acted well as there are who speak well! But they who give precepts, without carrying
them out into action, are distrusted;809 and if they shall be men, will be despised as
inconsistent:810 if it shall be God, He will be met with the excuse of the frailty of man’s
nature. It remains that words should be confirmed by deeds, which the philosophers are

unable to do. Therefore, since the instructors themselves are overcome by the affections
which they say that it is our duty to overcome, they are able to train no one to virtue, which
they falsely proclaim;811 and for this cause they imagine that no perfect wise man has as yet
existed, that is, in whom the greatest virtue and perfect justice were in harmony with the
greatest learning and knowledge. And this indeed was true. For no one since the creation
of the world has been such, except Christ, who both delivered wisdom by His word, and
confirmed His teaching by presenting virtue to the eyes of men.812</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIV.—THE OVERTHROWING OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOVE URGED BY
WAY OF OBJECTION.</head>
<p>Come, let us now consider whether a teacher sent from heaven can fail to be perfect. I
do not as yet speak of Him whom they deny to have come from God. Let us suppose that
some one were to be sent from heaven to instruct the life of men in the first principles of
virtue, and to form them to righteousness. No one can doubt but that this teacher, who is
sent from heaven, would be as perfect in the knowledge of all things as in virtue, lest there
should be no difference between a heavenly and an earthly teacher. For in the case of a man
his instruction can by no means be from within and of himself.813 For the mind, shut in by
earthly organs, and hindered by a corrupt814 body, of itself can neither comprehend nor
receive the truth, unless it is taught from another source.815 And if it had this power in the
greatest degree, yet it would be unable to attain to the highest virtue, and to resist all vices,
the materials of which are contained in our bodily816 organs. Hence it comes to pass, that
an earthly teacher cannot be perfect. But a teacher from heaven, to whom His divine nature
gives knowledge, and His immortality gives virtue, must of necessity in His teaching also,
as in other things, be perfect and complete. But this cannot by any means happen, unless
He should take to Himself a mortal body. And the reason why it cannot happen is manifest.
For if He should come to men as God, not to mention that mortal eyes cannot look upon
and endure the glory of His majesty in His own person, assuredly God will not be able to
teach virtue; for, inasmuch as He is without a body, He will not practice the things which
He will teach, and through this His teaching will not be perfect. Otherwise, if it is the greatest
virtue patiently to endure pain for the sake of righteousness and duty, if it is virtue not to
fear death itself when threatened, and when inflicted to undergo it with fortitude; it follows
that the perfect teacher ought both to teach these things by precept, and to confirm them
by practice. For he who gives precepts for the life, ought to remove every method817 of excuse,
that he may impose upon men the necessity of obedience, not by any constraint, but by a
sense of shame, and yet may leave them liberty, that a reward may be appointed for those
who obey, because it was in their power not to obey if they so wished; and a punishment
for those who do not obey, because it was in their power to obey if they so wished. How
then can excuse be removed, unless the teacher should practice what he teaches, and as it
were go before818 and hold out his hand to one who is about to follow? But how can one

<pb n="277"/>
practice what he teaches, unless he is like him whom he teaches? For if he be subject to no
passion, a man may thus answer him who is the teacher: It is my wish not to sin, but I am
overpowered; for I am clothed with frail and weak flesh: it is this which covets, which is
angry, which fears pain and death. And thus I am led on against my will;819 and I sin, not
because it is my wish, but because I am compelled. I myself perceive that I sin; but the necessity
imposed by my frailty, which I am unable to resist, impels me. What will that teacher
of righteousness say in reply to these things? How will he refute and convict a man who
shall allege the frailty of the flesh as an excuse for his faults, unless he himself also shall be
clothed with flesh, so that he may show that even the flesh is capable of virtue? For obstinacy
cannot be refuted except by example. For the things which you teach cannot have any weight
unless you shall be the first to practice them; because the nature of men is inclined to faults,
and wishes to sin not only with indulgence, but also with a reasonable plea.820 It is befitting
that a master and teacher of virtue should most closely resemble man, that by overpowering
sin he may teach man that sin may be overpowered by him. But if he is immortal, he can
by no means propose an example to man. For there will stand forth some one persevering
in his opinion, and will say: You indeed do not sin, because you are free from this body; you
do not covet, because nothing is needed by an immortal; but I have need of many things
for the support of this life. You do not fear death, because it can have no power against you.
You despise pain, because you can suffer no violence. But I, a mortal, fear both, because
they bring upon me the severest tortures, which the weakness of the flesh cannot endure.
A teacher of virtue therefore ought to have taken away this excuse from men, that no one
may ascribe it to necessity that he sins, rather than to his own fault. Therefore, that a
teacher may be perfect, no objection ought to be brought forward by him who is to be taught,
so that if he should happen to say, You enjoin impossibilities; the teacher may answer, See,
I myself do them. But I am clothed with flesh, and it is the property of flesh to sin.821 I too
bear the same flesh, and yet sin does not bear rule in me. It is difficult for me to despise
riches, because otherwise I am unable to live in this body. See, I too have a body, and yet I
contend against every desire. I am not able to bear pain or death for righteousness, because
I am frail. See, pain and death have power over me also; and I overcome those very things
which you fear, that I may make you victorious over pain and death. I go before you through
<note type="footnote">819 Thus St. Paul complains, Rom. vii. 15: “What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I;” and ver.
21, “I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me.” But (viii. 3) he says, “What the law
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
condemned sin in the flesh.”</note>
<note type="footnote">820 Cum ratione.</note>
<note type="footnote">821 This is urged as an excuse by him to whom the precept is addressed. In this and the following sentences

<pb n="278"/>
those things which you allege that it is impossible to endure: if you are not able to follow
me giving directions, follow me going before you. In this way all excuse is taken away, and
you must confess that man is unjust through his own fault, since he does not follow a
teacher of virtue, who is at the same time a guide. You see, therefore, how much more perfect
is a teacher who is mortal, because he is able to be a guide to one who is mortal, than one
who is immortal, for he is unable to teach patient endurance who is not subject to passions.
Nor, however, does this extend so far that I prefer man to God; but to show that man cannot
be a perfect teacher unless he is also God, that he may by his heavenly authority impose
upon men the necessity of obedience; nor God, unless he is clothed with a mortal body, that
by carrying out his precepts to their completion822 in actions, he may bind others by the
necessity of obedience. It plainly therefore appears, that he who is a guide of life and teacher
of righteousness must have a body, and that his teaching cannot otherwise be full and perfect,
unless it has a root and foundation, and remains firm and fixed among men; and that he
himself must undergo weakness of flesh and body, and display in himself823 the virtue of
which he is a teacher, that he may teach it at the same time both by words and deeds. Also,
he must be subject to death and all sufferings, since the duties of virtue are occupied with
the enduring of suffering, and the undergoing death; all which, as I have said, a perfect
teacher ought to endure, that he may teach the possibility of their being endured.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXV.—OF THE ADVENT OF JESUS IN THE FLESH AND SPIRIT, THAT HE
MIGHT BE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MAN.</head>
<p>Let men therefore learn and understand why the Most High God, when He sent His
ambassador and messenger to instruct mortals with the precepts of His righteousness, willed
that He should be clothed with mortal flesh, and be afflicted with torture, and be sentenced
to death. For since there was no righteousness on earth, He sent a teacher, as it were a living
law, to found a new name and temple,824 that by His words and example He might spread
throughout the earth a true and holy worship. But, however, that it might be certain that
He was sent by God, it was befitting that He should not be born as man is born, composed
of a mortal on both sides;825 but that it might appear that He was heavenly even in the form
of man, He was born without the office of a father. For He had a spiritual Father, God; and
as God was the Father of His spirit without a mother, so a virgin was the mother of His body
without a father. He was therefore both God and man, being placed in the middle between
God and man. From which the Greeks call Him Mesites,826 that He might be able to lead
man to God—that is, to immortality: for if He had been God only (as we have before said),
He would not have been able to afford to man examples of goodness; if He had been man
only, He would not have been able to compel men to righteousness, unless there had been
added an authority and virtue greater than that of man.</p>
<p>For, since man is composed of flesh and spirit, and the spirit must earn827 immortality
by works of righteousness, the flesh, since it is earthly, and therefore mortal, draws with itself
the spirit linked to it, and leads it from immortality to death. Therefore the spirit, apart from
the flesh, could by no means be a guide to immortality for man, since the flesh hinders the
spirit from following God. For it is frail, and liable to sin; but sin is the food and nourishment828
of death. For this cause, therefore, a mediator came—that is, God in the flesh—that
the flesh might be able to follow Him, and that He might rescue man from death, which has
dominion over the flesh. Therefore He clothed Himself with flesh, that the desires of the
flesh being subdued, He might teach that to sin was not the result of necessity, but of man’s
purpose and will. For we have one great and principal struggle to maintain with the flesh,

that we might be able to overcome these, God has opened and displayed to us the way of
overcoming the flesh. And this perfect and absolutely complete829 virtue bestows on those
who conquer, the crown and reward of immortality.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVI.—OF THE CROSS, AND OTHER TORTURES OF JESUS, AND OF THE
FIGURE OF THE LAMB UNDER THE LAW.</head>
<p>I have spoken of humiliation, and frailty, and suffering—why God thought fit to undergo
them. Now an account must be taken of the cross itself, and its meaning must be related.
What the Most High Father arranged from the beginning, and how He ordained all things
which were accomplished, not only the foretelling by the prophets, which preceded and was
proved true830 in Christ, but also the manner of His suffering itself teaches. For whatever
sufferings He underwent were not without meaning;831 but they had a figurative meaning832
and great significance, as had also those divine works which He performed, the strength
and power of which had some weight indeed for the present, but also declared something
for the future. Heavenly influence opened the eyes of the blind, and gave light to those who
did not see; and by this deed He signified that it would come to pass that, turning to the
nations which were ignorant of God, He might enlighten the breasts of the foolish with the
light of wisdom, and open the eyes of their understanding to the contemplation of the truth.
For they are truly blind who, not seeing heavenly things, and surrounded with the darkness
of ignorance, worship earthly and frail things. He opened the ears of the deaf. It is plain that
this divine power did not limit its exercise to this point;833 but He declared that it would
shortly come to pass, that they who were destitute of the truth would both hear and understand
the divine words of God. For you may truly call those deaf who do not hear the things
which are heavenly and true, and worthy of being performed. He loosed the tongues of the
dumb, so that they spake plainly.834 A power worthy of admiration,835 even when it was in
operation: but there was contained in this display836 of power another meaning, which
showed that it would shortly come to pass that those who were lately ignorant of heavenly
things, having received the instruction of wisdom, might speak respecting God and the
truth. For he who is ignorant of the divine nature, he truly is speechless and dumb, although
he is the most eloquent of all men. For when the tongue has begun to speak truth—that is,
to set forth the excellency and majesty of the one God—then only does it discharge the office
of its nature; but as long as it speaks false things it is not rightly employed:837 and therefore

measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: He maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to
speak.”</note>
<note type="footnote">836 Inerat huic virtuti.</note>

<pb n="282"/>
he must necessarily be speechless who cannot utter divine things. He also renewed the feet
of the lame to the office of walking,—a strength of divine work worthy of praise; but the
figure implied this, that the errors of a worldly and wandering life being restrained, the path
of truth was opened by which men might walk to attain the favour of God. For He is truly
to be considered lame, who, being enwrapped in the gloom and darkness of folly, and ignorant
in what direction to go, with feet liable to stumble and fall, walks in the way of death.</p>
<p>Likewise He cleansed the stains and blemishes of defiled bodies,—no slight exercise of
immortal power; but this strength prefigured that by the instruction of righteousness His
doctrine was about to purify those defiled by the stains of sins and the blemishes of vices.
For they ought truly to be accounted as leprous and unclean,838 whom either boundless
lusts compel to crimes, or insatiable pleasures to disgraceful deeds, and affect with an ever-
lasting stain those who are branded with the marks of dishonourable actions. He raised the
bodies of the dead as they lay prostrate; and calling them aloud by their names, He brought
them back from death. What is more suitable to God, what more worthy of the wonder of
all ages, than to have recalled839 the life which has run its course, to have added times to
the completed times of men, to have revealed the secrets of death? But this unspeakable
power was the image of a greater energy, which showed that His teaching was about to have
such might, that the nations throughout the world, which were estranged from God and
subject to death, being animated by the knowledge of the true light, might arrive at the rewards
of immortality. For you may rightly deem those to be dead, who, not knowing God
the giver of life, and depressing their souls from heaven to earth, run into the snares of
eternal death. The actions, therefore, which He then performed for the present, were representations
of future things; the things which He displayed in injured and diseased bodies
were figures840 of spiritual things, that at present He might display to us the works of an
energy which was not of earth, and for the future might show the power of His heavenly
majesty.841</p>
<p>Therefore, as His works had a signification also of greater power, so also His passion
did not go before us as simple, or superfluous, or by chance. But as those things which He
did signified the great efficacy and power of His teaching, so those things which He suffered
announced that wisdom would be held in hatred. For the vinegar which they gave Him to
drink, and the gall which they gave Him to eat, held forth hardships and severities842 in this

life to the followers of truth. And although His passion, which was harsh and severe in itself,
gave to us a sample of the future torments which virtue itself proposes to those who linger
in this world, yet drink and food of this kind, coming into the mouth of our teacher, afforded
us an example of pressures, and labours, and miseries. All which things must be undergone
and suffered by those who follow the truth; since the truth is bitter, and detested by all who,
being destitute of virtue, give up their life to deadly pleasures. For the placing of a crown of
thorns upon His head, declared that it would come to pass that He would gather to Himself
a holy people from those who were guilty. For people standing around in a circle are called
a corona.843 But we, who before that we knew God were unjust, were thorns—that is, evil
and guilty, not knowing what was good; and estranged from the conception and the works
of righteousness, polluted all things with wickedness and lust. Being taken, therefore, from
briars and thorns, we surround the sacred head of God; for, being called by Himself, and
spread around Him, we stand beside God, who is our Master and Teacher, and crown Him
King of the world, and Lord of all the living.</p>
<p>But with reference to the cross, it has great force and meaning, which I will now endeavour
to show. For God (as I have before explained), when He had determined to set man
free, sent as His ambassador to the earth a teacher of virtue, who might both by salutary
precepts train men to innocence, and by works and deeds before their eyes844 might open
the way of righteousness, by walking in which, and following his teacher, man might attain
to eternal life. He therefore assumed a body, and was clothed in a garment of flesh, that He
might hold out to man, for whose instruction He had come, examples of virtue and incitements
to its practice. But when He had afforded an example of righteousness in all the duties
of life, in order that He might teach man also the patient endurance of pain and contempt
of death, by which virtue is rendered perfect and complete, He came into the hands of an
impious nation, when, by the knowledge of the future which He had, He might have avoided
them, and by the same power by which He did wonderful works He might have repelled
them. Therefore He endured tortures, and stripes, and thorns. At last He did not refuse even
to undergo death, that under His guidance man might triumph over death, subdued and
bound in chains with all its terrors. But the reason why the Most High Father chose that
kind of death in preference to others, with which He should permit Him to be visited, is
this. For some one may perchance say: Why, if He was God, and chose to die, did He not
at least suffer by some honourable kind of death? why was it by the cross especially? why
by an infamous kind of punishment, which may appear unworthy even of a man if he is
<note type="footnote">843 The word “corona” denotes a “crown,” and also, as here, a “ring” of persons standing around. The play
on the word cannot be kept up in English. [Thus “corona tibi et judices defuerunt.” Cicero, Nat. Deor., ii. 1. So

free,845 although guilty? First of all, because He, who had come in humility that He might
bring assistance to the humble and men of low degree, and might hold out to all the hope
of safety, was to suffer by that kind of punishment by which the humble and low usually
suffer, that there might be no one at all who might not be able to imitate Him. In the next
place, it was in order that His body might be kept unmutilated,846 since He must rise again
from the dead on the third day.</p>
<p>Nor ought any one to be ignorant of this, that He Himself, speaking before of His passion,
also made it known that He had the power, when He willed it, of laying down His life and
of taking it again. Therefore, because He had laid down His life while fastened to the cross,
His executioners did not think it necessary to break His bones (as was their prevailing custom),
but they only pierced His side. Thus His unbroken body was taken down from the
cross, and carefully enclosed in a tomb. Now all these things were done lest His body, being
injured and broken, should be rendered unsuitable847 for rising again. That also was a
principal cause why God chose the cross, because it was necessary that He should be lifted
up on it, and the passion of God become known to all nations. For since he who is suspended
upon a cross is both conspicuous to all and higher than others, the cross was especially
chosen, which might signify that He would be so conspicuous, and so raised on high, that
all nations from the whole world should meet together at once to know and worship Him.
Lastly, no nation is so uncivilized, no region so remote, to which either His passion or the
height of His majesty would be unknown. Therefore in His suffering He stretched forth His
hands and measured out the world, that even then He might show that a great multitude,
collected together out of all languages and tribes, from the rising of the sun even to his setting,
was about to come under His wings, and to receive on their foreheads that great and lofty
sign.848 And the Jews even now exhibit a figure of this transaction when they mark their
thresholds with the blood of a lamb. For when God was about to smite the Egyptians, to
secure the Hebrews from that infliction He had enjoined them to slay a white849 lamb
<note type="footnote">845 The cross was the usual punishment of slaves.</note>
<note type="footnote">846 Integrum.</note>
<note type="footnote">847 A weak and senseless reason. The true cause is given by St. John xix. 36: “These things were done that
the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken.” [The previous question, however, remains:
Why was the Paschal lamb to be of unbroken bones, and why the special providence that fulfilled the type?
Doubtless He who raised up His body could have restored it, had the bones also been broken; but the preciousness
of Christ’s body was thus indicated as in the new tomb, the fine linen and spices, and the ministry of “the rich
in his death, because He had done no violence,” etc.—Isa. liii. 9.]</note>

without spot, and to place on their thresholds a mark from its blood. And thus, when the
first-born of the Egyptians had perished in one night, the Hebrews alone were saved by the
sign of the blood: not that the blood of a sheep had such efficacy in itself as to be the safety
of men, but it was an image of things to come. For Christ was the white lamb without spot;
that is, He was innocent, and just, and holy, who, being slain by the same Jews, is the salvation
of all who have written on their foreheads the sign of blood—that is, of the cross, on which
He shed His blood. For the forehead is the top of the threshold in man, and the wood
sprinkled with blood is the emblem850 of the cross. Lastly, the slaying of the lamb by those
very persons who perform it is called the paschal feast, from the word “paschein,”851 because
it is a figure of the passion, which God, foreknowing the future, delivered by Moses to be
celebrated by His people. But at that time the figure was efficacious at the present for
averting the danger, that it may appear what great efficacy the truth itself is about to have
for the protection of God’s people in the extreme necessity of the whole world. But in what
manner or in what region all will be safe who have marked on the highest part of their body
this sign of the true and divine blood,852 I will show in the last book.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVII.—OF THE WONDERS EFFECTED BY THE POWER OF THE CROSS,
AND OF DEMONS.</head>
<p>At present it is sufficient to show what great efficacy the power of this sign has. How
great a terror this sign is to the demons, he will know who shall see how, when adjured by
Christ, they flee from the bodies which they have besieged. For as He Himself, when He was
living among men, put to flight all the demons by His word, and restored to their former
senses the minds of men which had been excited and maddened by their dreadful attacks;
so now His followers, in the name of their Master, and by the sign of His passion, banish
the same polluted spirits from men. And it is not difficult to prove this. For when they sacrifice
to their gods, if any one bearing a marked forehead stands by, the sacrifices are by no
means favourable.853
<lg>
<l>“Nor can the diviner, when consulted, give answers.”854</l>
</lg>
And this has often been the cause of punishment to wicked kings. For when some of their
attendants who were of our religion855 were standing by their masters as they sacrificed,
having the sign placed on their foreheads, they caused the gods of their masters to flee, that
they might not be able to observe856 future events in the entrails of the victims. And when
the soothsayers understood this, at the instigation of the same demons to whom they had
sacrificed,857 complaining that profane men were present at the sacrifices, they drove their
princes to madness, so that they attacked the temple of the god, and contaminated themselves
by true sacrilege, which was expiated by the severest punishments on the part of their persecutors.
Nor, however, are blind men able to understand even from this, either that this is
the true religion, which contains such great power for overcoming, or that that is false, which
is not able to hold its ground or to come to an engagement.</p>
<p>But they say that the gods do this, not through fear, but through hatred; as though it
were possible for any one to hate another, unless it be him who injures, or has the power of
injuring. Yea, truly, it would be consistent with their majesty to visit those whom they hated
with immediate punishment,858 rather than to flee from them. But since they can neither
approach those in whom they shall see the heavenly mark, nor injure those whom the im-

mortal sign859 as an impregnable wall protects, they harass them by men, and persecute
them by the hands of others: and if they acknowledge the existence of these demons, we
have overcome; for this must necessarily be the true religion, which both understands the
nature of demons, and understands their subtlety, and compels them, vanquished and subdued,
to yield to itself. If they deny it, they will be refuted by the testimonies of poets and
philosophers. But if they do not deny the existence and malignity of demons, what remains
except that they affirm that there is a difference between gods and demons?860 Let them
therefore explain to us the difference between the two kinds, that we may know what is to
be worshipped and what to be held in execration; whether they have any mutual agreement,
or are really opposed to one another. If they are united by some necessity, how shall we
distinguish them? or how shall we unite the honour and worship of each kind? If, on the
other hand, they are enemies, how is it that the demons do not fear the gods, or that the
gods cannot put to flight the demons? Behold, some one excited by the impulse of the demon
is out of his senses, raves, is mad: let us lead him into the temple of the excellent and mighty
Jupiter; or since Jupiter knows not how to cure men, into the fane of Æsculapius or Apollo.
Let the priest of either, in the name of his god, command the wicked spirit to come out of
the man: that can in no way come to pass. What, then, is the power of the gods, if the demons
are not subject to their control? But, in truth, the same demons, when adjured by the name
of the true God, immediately flee. What reason is there why they should fear Christ, but not
fear Jupiter, unless that they whom the multitude esteem to be gods are also demons? Lastly,
if there should be placed in the midst one who is evidently suffering from an attack of a demon,
and the priest of the Delphian Apollo, they will in the same manner dread the name
of God; and Apollo will as quickly depart from his priest as the spirit of the demon from
the man; and his god being adjured and put to flight, the priest will be for ever silent.861
Therefore the demons, whom they acknowledge to be objects of execration, are the same
as the gods to whom they offer supplications.</p>
<p>If they imagine that we are unworthy of belief, let them believe Homer, who associated
the supreme Jupiter862 with the demons; and also other poets and philosophers, who speak
<note type="footnote">859 i.e., the sign of the cross, with which the early Christians frequently marked themselves. [So long as
Christians were mocked and despised as followers of a crucified one, there was a silent testimony and bold
confession in this act which must be wholly separated from the mere superstition of degenerate Christians. It
used to mean just what the Apostle says, Gal. vi. 14. In this sense it is retained among Anglicans.]</note>

of the same beings at one time as demons, and at another time as gods,—of which names
one is true, and the other false. For those most wicked spirits, when they are adjured, then
confess that they are demons; when they are worshipped, then falsely say that they are gods;
in order that they may lead men into errors,863 and call them away from the knowledge of
the true God, by which alone eternal death can be escaped. They are the same who, for the
sake of overthrowing man, have founded various systems of worship for themselves through
different regions,864—under false and assumed names, however, that they might deceive.
For because they were unable by themselves to aspire to divinity, they took to themselves
the names of powerful kings, under whose titles they might claim for themselves divine
honours; which error may be dispelled, and brought to the light of truth. For if any one desires
to inquire further into the matter, let him assemble those who are skilled in calling forth
spirits from the dead. Let them call forth865 Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan, Mercury, Apollo,
and Saturnus the father of all. All will answer from the lower regions; and being questioned
they will speak, and confess respecting themselves and God. After these things let them call
up Christ; He will not be present, He will not appear, for He was not more than two days
in the lower regions. What proof can be brought forward more certain than this? I have no
doubt that Trismegistus arrived at the truth by some proof of this kind, who spoke many

<head>CHAP. XXVIII.—OF HOPE AND TRUE RELIGION, AND OF SUPERSTITION.</head>
<p>And since these things are so, as we have shown, it is plain that no other hope of life is
set before man, except that, laying aside vanities and wretched error, he should know God,867
and serve God; except he renounce this temporary life, and train himself by the principles
of righteousness for the cultivation of true religion. For we are created on this condition,
that we pay just and due obedience to God who created us, that we should know and follow
Him alone. We are bound and tied to God by this chain of piety;868 from which religion itself
received its name, not, as Cicero explained it, from carefully gathering,869 for in his second
book respecting the nature of the gods he thus speaks: “For not only philosophers, but our
ancestors also, separated superstition from religion. For they who spent whole days in
prayers and sacrifices, that their children might survive870 them, were called superstitious.
But they who handled again, and as it were carefully gathered all things which related to the
worship of the gods, were called religious from carefully gathering,871 as some were called
elegant from choosing out, and diligent from carefully selecting and intelligent from understanding.
For in all these words there is the same meaning of gathering which there is in the
word religious: thus it has come to pass, that in the names superstitious and religious, the
one relates to a fault, the other belongs to praise.” How senseless this interpretation is, we
may know from the matter itself. For if both religion and superstition are engaged in the
worship of the same gods, there is little or rather no difference between them. For what
cause will he allege why he should think that to pray once for the health of sons is the part
of a religious man, but to do the same ten times is the part of a superstitious man? For if it
is an excellent thing to pray once, how much more so to do it more frequently! If it is well
to do it at the first hour, then it is well to do it throughout the day. If one victim renders the
deity propitious, it is plain that many victims must render him more propitious, because
multiplied services oblige872 rather than offend. For those servants do not appear to us
hateful who are assiduous and constant in their attendance, but more beloved. Why, therefore,

<note type="footnote">869 A religendo. There is little doubt that the true derivation of “religio” is from religere, not from religare
According to this, the primary meaning is, “the dwelling upon a subject, and continually recurring to it.”</note>

<note type="footnote">871 [Here the famous passage should be given with accurate reference to its place, as much of its force vanishes

diligendo diligentes, ex intelligendo intelligentes.”—De Nat. Deor., lib. ii. cap. 28.]</note>
<note type="footnote">872 Demerentur, “they lay under an obligation.”</note>

<pb n="290"/>
should he be in fault, and receive a name which implies censure,873 who either loves his
children more, or sufficiently honours the gods; and he, on the contrary, be praised, who
loves them less? And this argument has weight also from the contrary. For if it is wrong874
to pray and sacrifice during whole days, therefore it is wrong to do so once. If it is faulty
frequently to wish for the preservation of our children, therefore he also is superstitious
who conceives that wish even rarely. Or why should the name of a fault be derived from
that, than which nothing can be wished more honourable, nothing more just? For as to his
saying, that they who diligently take in hand again the things relating to the worship of the
gods are called religious from their carefully gathering; how is it, then, that they who do this
often in a day lose the name of religious men, when it is plain from their very assiduity that
they more diligently gather those things by which the gods are worshipped?</p>
<p>What, then, is it? Truly religion is the cultivation of the truth, but superstition of that
which is false. And it makes the entire difference what you worship, not how you worship,
or what prayer you offer.875 But because the worshippers of the gods imagine themselves
to be religious, though they are superstitious, they are neither able to distinguish religion
from superstition, nor to express the meaning of the names. We have said that the name of
religion is derived from the bond of piety,876 because God has tied man to Himself, and
bound him by piety;877 for we must serve Him as a master, and be obedient to Him as a
father. And therefore Lucretius878 better explained this name, who says that He loosens the
knots of superstitions.879 But they are called superstitious, not who wish their children to
survive them, for we all wish this; but either those who reverence the surviving memory of
the dead, or those who, surviving their parents, reverenced their images at their houses as
household gods. For those who assumed to themselves new rites, that they might honour
the dead as gods, whom they supposed to be taken from men and received into heaven, they

religious. From which Virgil says:881—

But since we find that the ancient gods also were consecrated in the same manner after their
death, therefore they are superstitious who worship many and false gods. We, on the other
hand, are religious, who make our supplications to the one true God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIX.—OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, AND OF THE UNION OF JESUS
WITH THE FATHER.</head>
<p>Some one may perhaps ask how, when we say that we worship one God only, we nevertheless
assert that there are two, God the Father and God the Son: which assertion has
driven many into the greatest error. For when the things which we say seem to them probable,
they consider that we fail in this one point alone, that we confess that there is another God,
and that He is mortal. We have already spoken of His mortality: now let us teach concerning
His unity. When we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them as
different, nor do we separate each: because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can
the Son be separated from the Father, since the name of Father882 cannot be given without
the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without the Father. Since, therefore, the Father makes
the Son, and the Son the Father, they both have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but
the former883 is as it were an overflowing fountain, the latter884 as a stream flowing forth
from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it were a ray885 extended from the sun. And since
He is both faithful to the Most High Father, and beloved by Him, He is not separated from
Him; just as the stream is not separated from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun: for the
water of the fountain is in the stream, and the light of the sun is in the ray: just as the voice
cannot be separated from the mouth, nor the strength or hand from the body. When,
therefore, He is also spoken of by the prophets as the hand, and strength, and word of God,
there is plainly no separation; for the tongue, which is the minister of speech, and the hand,
in which the strength is situated, are inseparable portions of the body.</p>
<p>We may use an example more closely connected with us. When any one has a son whom
he especially loves, who is still in the house, and in the power886 of his father, although he
concede to him the name and power of a master, yet by the civil law the house is one, and
one person is called master. So this world887 is the one house of God; and the Son and the
Father, who unanimously inhabit the world, are one God, for the one is as two, and the two
are as one. Nor is that wonderful, since the Son is in the Father, for the Father loves the Son,
and the Father is in the Son; for He faithfully obeys the will of the Father, nor does He ever
do nor has done anything except what the Father either willed or commanded. Lastly, that
the Father and the Son are but one God, Isaiah showed in that passage which we have brought
<note type="footnote">882 [i.e., the Everlasting Father implies the Everlasting Son.]</note>
<note type="footnote">883 Ille, i.e., the Father.</note>

forward before,888 when he said:889 “They shall fall down unto Thee, and make supplication
unto Thee, since God is in Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee.” And he also speaks
to the same purport in another place:890 “Thus saith God the King of Israel, and His Redeemer,
the everlasting God; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.”
When he had set forth two persons, one of God the King, that is, Christ, and the other of
God the Father, who after His passion raised Him from the dead, as we have said891 that
the prophet Hosea showed,892 who said, “I will redeem Him from the power of the grave:”
nevertheless, with reference to each person, he introduced the words, “and beside me there
is no God,” when he might have said “beside us;” but it was not right that a separation of
so close a relationship should be made by the use of the plural number. For there is one God
alone, free, most high, without any origin; for He Himself is the origin of all things, and in
Him at once both the Son and all things are contained. Wherefore, since the mind and will
of the one is in the other, or rather, since there is one in both, both are justly called one God;
for whatever is in the Father893 flows on to the Son, and whatever is in the Son descends
from the Father. Therefore that highest and matchless God cannot be worshipped except
through the Son. He who thinks that he worships the Father only, as he does not worship
the Son, so he does not worship even the Father. But he who receives the Son, and bears His
name, he truly together with the Son worships the Father also, since the Son is the ambassador,
and messenger, and priest of the Most High Father. He is the door of the greatest
temple, He the way of light, He the guide to salvation, He the gate of life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXX.—OF AVOIDING HERESIES AND SUPERSTITIONS, AND WHAT IS
THE ONLY TRUE CATHOLIC CHURCH.</head>
<p>But since many heresies have existed, and the people of God have been rent into divisions
at the instigation of demons, the truth must be briefly marked out by us, and placed in its
own peculiar dwelling-place, that if any one shall desire to draw the water of life, he may
not be borne to broken cisterns894 which hold no water, but may know the abundant
fountain of God, watered by which he may enjoy perpetual light. Before all things, it is befitting
that we should know both that He Himself and His ambassadors foretold that there
must be numerous sects and heresies,895 which would break the unity896 of the sacred body;
and that they admonished us to be on our guard with the greatest prudence, lest we should
at any time fall into the snares and deceits of that adversary of ours, with whom God has
willed that we should contend. Then that He gave us sure commands, which we ought always
to treasure in our minds; for many, forgetting them, and abandoning the heavenly road,
have made for themselves devious paths amidst windings and precipices, by which they
might lead away the incautious and simple part of the people to the darkness of death: I will
explain how this happened. There were some of our religion whose faith was less established,
or who were less learned or less cautious, who rent the unity and divided the Church. But
they whose faith was unsettled,897 when they pretended that they knew and worshipped
God, aiming at the increase of their wealth and honour, aspired to the highest sacerdotal
power; and when overcome by others more powerful, preferred to secede with their supporters,
than to endure those set over them, over whom they themselves before desired to be
set.898</p>
<p>But some, not sufficiently instructed in heavenly learning, when they were unable to
reply to the accusers of the truth, who objected that it was either impossible or inconsistent
that God should be shut up in the womb of a woman, and that the Majesty of heaven could
not be reduced to such weakness as to become an object of contempt and derision, a reproach
and mockery to men; lastly, that He should even endure tortures, and be affixed to the accursed
cross; and when they could defend and refute all these things neither by talent nor
learning, for they did not thoroughly perceive their force and meaning, they were perverted899
from the right path, and corrupted the sacred writings, so that they composed for themselves
a new doctrine without any root and stability. But some, enticed by the prediction of false

prophets, concerning whom both the true prophets and he himself had foretold, fell away
from the knowledge of God, and left the true tradition. But all of these, ensnared by frauds
of demons, which they ought to have foreseen and guarded against, by their carelessness
lost the name and worship of God. For when they are called Phrygians,900 or Novatians,901
or Valentinians,902 or Marcionites,903 or Anthropians,904 or Arians,905 or by any other
name, they have ceased to be Christians, who have lost the name of Christ, and assumed
human and external names. Therefore it is the Catholic Church alone which retains true
worship.</p>
<p>This is the fountain of truth, this is the abode of the faith, this is the temple of God; into
which if any one shall not enter, or from which if any shall go out, he is estranged from the
hope of life and eternal salvation. No one ought to flatter himself with persevering strife.
For the contest is respecting life and salvation, which, unless it is carefully and diligently
kept in view, will be lost and extinguished. But, however, because all the separate assemblies
of heretics call themselves Christians in preference to others, and think that theirs is the
Catholic Church, it must be known that the true Catholic Church is that in which there is
confession and repentance,906 which treats in a wholesome manner the sins and wounds
to which the weakness of the flesh is liable. I have related these things in the meanwhile for
the sake of admonition, that no one who desires to avoid error may be entangled in a

<p>Here we should look for something also concerning the Holy Spirit. But our author’s
principle is doubtless a reflection of the prevailing sentiment of the Church at this period,
which was perhaps a violent exaggeration of our Lord’s example (Mark iv. 33). And see
something of this on p. 140, note 6, infra; also Matt. vii. 6.</p>

<p>II.
(On cap. 30.)</p>
<p>The simplicity with which our author gives a note of the Catholic Church, in accordance
with African canons and the teaching of Cyprian, is very noteworthy. It never occurred to
him that communion with any one particular See was the note. Hippolytus alone would
have reminded him that the worst heretics had been in communion with both Zephyrinus
and Callistus in his days (see vol. v. pp. 156 and 160; also Ibid., 125, 130), and that orthodoxy
had been persecuted by these bishops of Rome.</p>

<head>CHAP. I.—OF THE NON-CONDEMNATION OF ACCUSED PERSONS WITHOUT
A HEARING OF THEIR CAUSE; FROM WHAT CAUSE PHILOSOPHERS DESPISED
THE SACRED WRITINGS; OF THE FIRST ADVOCATES OF THE CHRISTIAN
RELIGION.</head>
<p>I Entertain no doubt, O mighty Emperor Constantine,909—since they are impatient
through excessive superstition,—that if any one of those who are foolishly religious should
take in hand this work of ours, in which that matchless Creator of all things and Ruler of
this boundless world is asserted, he would even assail it with abusive language, and perhaps,
having scarcely read the beginning, would dash it to the ground, cast it from him, curse it,
and think himself contaminated and bound by inexpiable guilt if he should patiently read
or hear these things. We demand, however, from this man, if it is possible, by the right of
human nature,910 that he should not condemn before that he knows the whole matter. For
if the right of defending themselves is given to sacrilegious persons, and to traitors and
sorcerers, and if it is lawful for no one to be condemned beforehand, his cause being as yet
untried, we do not appear to ask unjustly, that if there shall be any one who shall have fallen
upon this subject, if he shall read it, he read it throughout; if he shall hear it, that he put off
the forming of an opinion until the end. But I know the obstinacy of men; we shall never
succeed in obtaining this. For they fear lest they should be overcome by us, and be compelled
at length to yield, truth itself crying out. They interrupt, therefore, and make hindrances,
that they may not hear; and close their eyes, that they may not see the light which we present
to them. Wherefore they themselves plainly show their distrust in their own abandoned
system, since they neither venture to investigate, nor to engage with as, because they know
that they are easily overpowered. And therefore, discussion being taken away,
<lg>
<l>“Wisdom is driven from among them, they have recourse to violence,”</l>
</lg>
as Ennius says; and because they eagerly endeavour to condemn as guilty those whom they
plainly know to be innocent, they are unwilling to be agreed respecting innocence itself; as
though, in truth, it were a greater injustice to have condemned innocence, when proved to
be such, than unheard. But, as I said, they are afraid lest, if they should hear, they should be
unable to condemn.</p>
<p>And therefore they torture, put to death, and banish the worshippers of the Most High
God, that is, the righteous; nor are they, who so vehemently hate, themselves able to assign
the causes of their hatred. Because they are themselves in error, they are angry with those

who follow the path of truth; and when they are able to correct themselves, they greatly increase911
their errors by cruel deeds, they are stained with the blood of the innocent, and
they tear away with violence souls dedicated to God from the lacerated bodies. Such are the
men with whom we now endeavour to engage and to dispute: these are the men whom we
would lead away from a foolish persuasion to the truth, men who would more readily drink
blood than imbibe the words of the righteous. What then? Will our labour be in vain? By
no means. For if we shall not be able to deliver these from death, to which they are hastening
with the greatest speed; if we cannot recall them from that devious path to life and light,
since they themselves oppose their own safety; yet we shall strengthen those who belong to
us, whose opinion is not settled, and founded and fixed with solid roots. For many of them
waver, and especially those who have any acquaintance with literature. For in this respect
philosophers, and orators, and poets are pernicious, because they are easily able to ensnare
unwary souls by the sweetness of their discourse, and of their poems flowing with delightful
modulation. These are sweets912 which conceal poison. And on this account I wished to
connect wisdom with religion, that that vain system may not at all injure the studious; so
that now the knowledge of literature may not only be of no injury to religion and righteousness,
but may even be of the greatest profit, if he who has learned it should be more instructed
in virtues and wiser in truth.</p>
<p>Moreover, even though it should be profitable to no other, it certainly will be so to us:
the conscience will delight itself, and the mind will rejoice that it is engaged in the light of
truth, which is the food of the soul, being overspread with an incredible kind of pleasantness.
But we must not despair. Perchance
<lg>
<l>“We sing not to the deaf.”913</l>
</lg>
For neither are affairs in so bad a condition that there are no sound minds to which the
truth may be pleasing, and which may both see and follow the right course when it is pointed
out to them. Only let the cup be anointed914 with the heavenly honey of wisdom, that the
bitter remedies may be drunk by them unawares, without any annoyance, whilst the first
sweetness of taste by its allurement conceals, under the cover915 of pleasantness, the bitterness
of the harsh flavour. For this is especially the cause why, with the wise and the learned, and

the princes of this world, the sacred Scriptures are without credit, because the prophets
spoke in common and simple language, as though they spoke to the people. And therefore
they are despised by those who are willing to hear or read nothing except that which is polished
and eloquent; nor is anything able to remain fixed in their minds, except that which
charms their ears by a more soothing sound. But those things which appear humble916 are
considered anile, foolish, and common. So entirely do they regard nothing as true, except
that which is pleasant to the ear; nothing as credible, except that which can excite917 pleasure:
no one estimates918 a subject by its truth, but by its embellishment. Therefore they do not
believe the sacred writings, because they are without any pretence;919 but they do not even
believe those who explain them, because they also are either altogether ignorant, or at any
rate possessed of little learning. For it very rarely happens that they are wholly eloquent;
and the cause of this is evident. For eloquence is subservient to the world, it desires to display
itself to the people, and to please in things which are evil; since it often endeavours to overpower
the truth, that it may show its power; it seeks wealth, desires honours; in short, it
demands the highest degree of dignity. Therefore it despises these subjects as low; it avoids
secret things as contrary to itself, inasmuch as it rejoices in publicity, and longs for the
multitude and celebrity. Hence it comes to pass that wisdom and truth need suitable heralds.
And if by chance any of the learned have betaken themselves to it, they have not been sufficient
for its defence.</p>
<p>Of those who are known to me, Minucius Felix was of no ignoble rank among pleaders.
His book, which bears the title of Octavius, declares how suitable a maintainer of the truth
he might have been, if he had given himself altogether to that pursuit.920 Septimius
Tertullianus also was skilled in literature of every kind; but in eloquence he had little readiness,
and was not sufficiently polished, and very obscure. Not even therefore did he find
sufficient renown. Cyprianus, therefore, was above all others921 distinguished and renowned,
since he had sought great glory to himself from the profession of the art of oratory, and he
wrote very many things worthy of admiration in their particular class. For he was of a turn
of mind which was ready, copious, agreeable, and (that which is the greatest excellence of
style) plain and open; so that you cannot determine whether he was more embellished in
speech, or more ready in explanation, or more powerful in persuasion. And yet he is unable

whom his writings have happened to be known. I have heard of a certain man who was
skilful indeed, who by the change of a single letter called him Coprianus,922 as though he
were one who had applied to old women’s fables a mind which was elegant and fitted for
better things. But if this happened to him whose eloquence is not unpleasant, what then
must we suppose happens to those whose discourse is meagre and displeasing, who could
have had neither the power of persuasion, nor subtlety in arguing, nor any severity at all for

<head>CHAP. II.—TO WHAT AN EXTENT THE CHRISTIAN TRUTH HAS BEEN ASSAILED
BY RASH MEN.</head>
<p>Therefore, because there have been wanting among us suitable and skilful teachers, who
might vigorously and sharply refute public errors, and who might defend the whole cause
of truth with elegance and copiousness, this very want incited some to venture to write
against the truth, which was unknown to them. I pass by those who in former times in vain
assailed it. When I was teaching rhetorical learning in Bithynia, having been called thither,
and it had happened that at the same time the temple of God was overthrown, there were
living at the same place two men who insulted the truth as it lay prostrate and overthrown,
I know not whether with greater arrogance or harshness: the one of whom professed himself
the high priest of philosophy;923 but he was so addicted to vice, that, though a teacher of
abstinence, he was not less inflamed with avarice than with lusts; so extravagant in his
manner of living, that though in his school he was the maintainer of virtue, the praiser of
parsimony and poverty, he dined less sumptuously in a palace than at his own house. Nevertheless
he sheltered924 his vices by his hair925 and his cloak, and (that which is the greatest
screen926) by his riches; and that he might increase these, he used to penetrate with wonderful
effort927 to the friendships of the judges; and he suddenly attached them to himself by the
authority of a fictitious name, not only that he might make a traffic of their decisions, but
also that he might by this influence hinder his neighbours, whom he was driving from their
homes and lands, from the recovery of their property. This man, in truth, who overthrew
his own arguments by his character, or censured his own character by his arguments, a
weighty censor and most keen accuser against himself, at the very same time in which a
righteous people were impiously assailed, vomited forth three books against the Christian
religion and name; professing, above all things, that it was the office of a philosopher to
remedy the errors of men, and to recall them to the true way, that is, to the worship of the
gods, by whose power and majesty, as he said, the world is governed; and not to permit that
inexperienced men should be enticed by the frauds of any, lest their simplicity should be a
prey and sustenance to crafty men.</p>

<p>Therefore he said that he had undertaken this office, worthy of philosophy, that he
might hold out to those who do not see the light of wisdom, not only that they may return
to a healthy state of mind, having undertaken the worship of the gods, but also that, having
laid aside their pertinacious obstinacy, they may avoid tortures of the body, nor wish in vain
to endure cruel lacerations of their limbs. But that it might be evident on what account he
had laboriously worked out that task, he broke out profusely into praises of the princes,
whose piety and foresight, as he himself indeed said, had been distinguished both in other
matters, and especially in defending the religious rites of the gods; that he had, in short,
consulted the interests of men, in order that, impious and foolish superstition having been
restrained, all men might have leisure for lawful sacred rites, and might experience the gods
propitious to them. But when he wished to weaken the grounds of that religion against
which he was pleading, he appeared senseless, vain, and ridiculous; because that weighty
adviser of the advantage of others was ignorant not only what to oppose, but even what to
speak. For if any of our religion were present, although they were silent on account of the
time, nevertheless in their mind they derided him; since they saw a man professing that he
would enlighten others, when he himself was blind; that he would recall others from error,
when he himself was ignorant where to plant his feet; that he would instruct others to the
truth, of which he himself had never seen even a spark at any time; inasmuch as he who was
a professor of wisdom, endeavoured to overthrow wisdom. All, however, censured this, that
he undertook this work at that time in particular, in which odious cruelty raged. O philosopher,
a flatterer, and a time-server! But this man was despised, as his vanity deserved; for
he did not gain the popularity which he hoped for, and the glory which he eagerly sought
for was changed into censure and blame.928</p>
<p>Another929 wrote the same subject with more bitterness, who was then of the number
of the judges, and who was especially the adviser of enacting persecution; and not contented
with this crime, he also pursued with writings those whom he had persecuted. For he com-
posed two books, not against the Christians, lest he might appear to assail them in a hostile
manner but to the Christians, that he might be thought to consult for them with humanity
and kindness. And in these writings he endeavoured so to prove the falsehood of sacred
Scripture, as though it were altogether contradictory to itself; for he expounded some chapters
which seemed to be at variance with themselves, enumerating so many and such secret930

Demosthenes will be able to defend from the charge of impiety him who became the betrayer
of the religion to which he had given his assent,931 and of the faith the name of which he
had assumed,932 and of the mystery933 which he had received, unless it happened by chance
that the sacred writings fell into his hands? What rashness was it, therefore, to dare to destroy
that which no one explained to him! It was well that he either learned nothing or understood
nothing. For contradiction is as far removed from the sacred writings as he was removed
from faith and truth. He chiefly, however, assailed Paul and Peter, and the other disciples,
as disseminators of deceit, whom at the same time he testified to have been unskilled and
unlearned. For he says that some of them made gain by the craft of fishermen, as though he
took it ill that some Aristophanes or Aristarchus did not devise that subject.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE, AND THE VANITY
OF ITS ADVERSARIES; AND THAT CHRIST WAS NOT A MAGICIAN.</head>
<p>The desire of inventing,934 therefore, and craftiness were absent from these men, since
they were unskilful. Or what unlearned man could invent things adapted to one another,
and coherent, when the most learned of the philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, and Epicurus
and Zeno, themselves spoke things at variance with one another, and contrary? For this is
the nature of falsehoods, that they cannot be coherent. But their teaching, because it is true,
everywhere agrees,935 and is altogether consistent with itself; and on this account it effects
persuasion, because it is based on a consistent plan. They did not therefore devise that religion
for the sake of gain and advantage, inasmuch as both by their precepts and in reality they
followed that course of life which is without pleasures, and despised all things which are
reckoned among good things, and since they not only endured death for their faith, but also
both knew and foretold that they were about to die, and afterwards that all who followed
their system would suffer cruel and impious things. But he936 affirmed that Christ Himself
was put to flight by the Jews, and having collected a band of nine hundred men, committed
robberies. Who would venture to oppose so great an authority? We must certainly believe
this, for perchance some Apollo announced it to him in his slumbers. So many robbers have
at all times perished, and do perish daily, and you yourself have certainly condemned many:
which of them after his crucifixion was called, I will not say a God, but a man? But you
perchance believed it from the circumstance of your having consecrated the homicide Mars
as a god, though you would not have done this if the Areopagites had crucified him.</p>
<p>The same man, when he endeavoured to overthrow his wonderful deeds, and did not
however deny them, wished to show that Apollonius937 performed equal or even greater
deeds. It is strange that he omitted to mention Apuleius,938 of whom many and wonderful
things are accustomed to be related. Why therefore, O senseless one, does no one worship
Apollonius in the place of God? unless by chance you alone do so, who are worthy forsooth
of that god, with whom the true God will punish you everlastingly. If Christ is a magician

with those of Christ. [See Origen, vol. iv. p. 591, this series.]</note>

<pb n="306"/>
because He performed wonderful deeds, it is plain that Apollonius, who, according to your
description, when Domitian wished to punish him, suddenly disappeared on his trial, was
more skilful than He who was both arrested and crucified. But perhaps he wished from this
very thing to prove the arrogance of Christ, in that He made Himself God, that the other
may appear to have been more modest, who, though he performed greater actions, as this
one thinks, nevertheless did not claim that for himself. I omit at present to compare the
works themselves, because in the second and preceding book I have spoken respecting the
fraud and tricks of the magic art. I say that there is no one who would not wish that that
should especially befall him after death which even the greatest kings desire. For why do
men prepare for themselves magnificent sepulchres why statues and images? why by some
illustrious deeds, or even by death undergone in behalf of their countrymen, do they endeav-
our to deserve the good opinions of men? Why, in short, have you yourself wished to raise
a monument of your talent, built with this detestable folly, as if with mud, except that you
hope for immortality from the remembrance of your name? It is foolish, therefore, to imagine
that Apollonius did not desire that which he would plainly wish for if he were able to attain
to it; because there is no one who refuses immortality, and especially when you say that he
was both adored by some as a god, and that his image was set up under the name of Hercules,
the averter of evil, and is even now honoured by the Ephesians.</p>
<p>He could not therefore after death be believed to be a god, because it was evident that
he was both a man and a magician; and for this reason he affected939 divinity under the title
of a name belonging to another, for in his own name he was unable to attain it, nor did he
venture to make the attempt. But he of whom we speak940 could both be believed to be a
god, because he was not a magician, and was believed to be such because he was so in truth.
I do not say this, he says, that Apollonius was not accounted a god, because he did not wish
it, but that it may be evident that we, who did not at once connect a belief in his divinity
with wonderful deeds, are wiser than you, who on account of slight wonders believed that
he was a god. It is not wonderful if you, who are far removed from the wisdom of God, understand
nothing at all of those things which you have read, since the Jews, who from the
beginning had frequently read the prophets, and to whom the mystery941 of God had been
assigned, were nevertheless ignorant of what they read. Learn, therefore, if you have any
sense, that Christ was not believed by us to be God on this account, because He did wonderful
things, but because we saw that all things were done in His case which were announced to
us by the prediction of the prophets. He performed wonderful deeds: we might have supposed
Him to be a magician, as you now suppose Him to be, and the Jews then supposed Him, if
<note type="footnote">939 Affectavit divinitatem.</note>

<note type="footnote">941 Sacramentum.</note>

<pb n="307"/>
all the prophets did not with one accord942 proclaim that Christ would do those very things.
Therefore we believe Him to be God, not more from His wonderful deeds and works, than
from that very cross which you as dogs lick, since that also was predicted at the same time.
It was not therefore on His own testimony (for who can be believed when he speaks concerning
himself?), but on the testimony of the prophets who long before foretold all things
which He did and suffered, that He gained a belief in His divinity, which could have happened
neither to Apollonius,943 nor to Apuleius, nor to any of the magicians; nor can it happen
at any time. When, therefore, he had poured forth such absurd ravings944 of his ignorance,
when he had eagerly endeavoured utterly to destroy the truth, he dared to give to his books
which were impious and the enemies of God the title of “truth-loving.” O blind breast! O
mind more black than Cimmerian darkness, as they say! He may perhaps have been a disciple
of Anaxagoras,945 to whom snows were as black as ink. But it is the same blindness, to give
the name of falsehood to truth, and of truth to falsehood. Doubtless the crafty man wished
to conceal the wolf under the skin of a sheep,946 that he might ensnare the reader by a deceitful
title. Let it be true; grant that you did this from ignorance, not from malice: what
truth, however, have you brought to us, except that, being a defender of the gods, you had
at last betrayed those very gods? For, having set forth the praises of the Supreme God, whom
you confessed to be king, most mighty, the maker of all things, the fountain of honours, the
parent of all, the creator and preserver of all living creatures, you took away the kingdom
from your own Jupiter; and when you had driven him from the supreme power, you reduced
him to the rank of servants. Thus your own conclusion947 convicts you of folly, vanity, and
error. For you affirm that the gods exist, and yet you subject and enslave them to that God
whose religion you attempt to overturn.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—WHY THIS WORK WAS PUBLISHED, AND AGAIN OF TERTULLIAN
AND CYPRIAN.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, they of whom I have spoken had set forth their sacrilegious writings
in my presence, and to my grief, being incited both by the arrogant impiety of these, and
by the consciousness of truth itself, and (as I think) by God, I have undertaken this office,
that with all the strength of my mind I might refute the accusers of righteousness; not that
I should write against these, who might be crushed with a few words, but that I might once
for all by one attack overthrow all who everywhere effect, or have effected, the same work.
For I do not doubt that very many others, and in many places, and that not only in Greek,
but also in Latin writings, have raised a monument of their own unrighteousness. And since
I was not able to reply to these separately, I thought that this cause was to be so pleaded by
me that I might overthrow former writers, together with all their writings, and cut off from
future writers the whole power of writing and of replying.948 Only let them attend, and I
will assuredly effect that whosoever shall know these things, must either embrace that which
he before condemned, or, which is next to it, cease at length to deride it. Although Tertullian
fully pleaded the same cause in that treatise which is entitled the Apology,949 yet, inasmuch
as it is one thing to answer accusers, which consists in defence or denial only, and another
thing to instruct, which we do, in which the substance of the whole system must be contained,
I have not shrunk from this labour, that I might complete the subject, which Cyprian did
not fully carry out in that discourse in which he endeavours to refute Demetrianus (as he
himself says) railing at and clamouring950 against the truth. Which subject he did not handle
as he ought to have done; for he ought to have been refuted not by the testimonies of
Scripture, which he plainly considered vain, fictitious, and false, but by arguments and
reason. For, since he was contending against a man who was ignorant of the truth, he ought
for a while to have laid aside divine readings, and to have formed from the beginning this
man as one who was altogether ignorant,951 and to have shown to him by degrees the beginnings
of light, that he might not be dazzled,952 the whole of its brightness being presented
to him.953</p>

this man, because he was not yet capable of receiving divine things, should be presented
with human testimonies—that is, of philosophers and historians—in order that he might
especially be refuted by his own authorities. And since he did not do this, being carried away
by his distinguished knowledge of the sacred writings, so that he was content with those
things alone in which faith consists, I have undertaken, with the favour of God, to do this,
and at the same time to prepare the way for the imitation of others. And if, through my exhortation,
learned and eloquent men shall begin to betake themselves to this subject, and
shall choose to display their talents and power of speaking in this field of truth, no one can
doubt that false religions will quickly disappear, and philosophy altogether fall, if all shall
be persuaded that this alone is religion and the only true wisdom. But I have wandered from

<head>CHAP. V.—THERE WAS TRUE JUSTICE UNDER SATURNUS, BUT IT WAS
BANISHED BY JUPITER.</head>
<p>Now the promised disputation concerning justice must be given; which is either by itself
the greatest virtue, or by itself the fountain of virtue, which not only philosophers sought,
but poets also, who were much earlier, and were esteemed as wise before the origin of the
name of philosophy. These clearly understood that this justice was absent from the affairs
of men; and they feigned that it, being offended with the vices of men, departed from the
earth, and withdrew to heaven; and that they may teach what it is to live justly (for they are
accustomed to give precepts by circumlocutions), they repeat examples of justice from the
times of Saturnus, which they call the golden times, and they relate in what condition human
life was while it delayed on the earth.954 And this is not to be regarded as a poetic fiction,
but as the truth. For, while Saturnus reigned, the religious worship of the gods not having
yet been instituted, nor any955 race being as yet set apart in the belief of its divinity, God
was manifestly worshipped. And therefore there were neither dissensions, nor enmities, nor
wars.
<lg>
<l>“Not yet had rage unsheathed maddened swords,”</l>
</lg>
as Germanicus Cæsar speaks in his poem translated from Aratus,956
<lg>
<l>“Nor had discord been known among relatives.”</l>
</lg>
No, nor even among strangers: but there were no swords at all to be unsheathed. For who,
when justice was present and in vigour, would think respecting his own protection, since
no one plotted against him; or respecting the destruction of another, since no one desired
anything?

<l>“They preferred to live content with a simple mode of life,”</l>

as Cicero957 relates in his poem; and this is peculiar to our religion. “It was not even allowed
to mark out or to divide the plain with a boundary: men sought all things in common;”958
since God had given the earth in common to all, that they might pass their life in common,
not that mad and raging avarice might claim all things for itself, and that that which was
produced for all might not be wanting to any. And this saying of the poet ought so to be
taken, not as suggesting the idea that individuals at that time had no private property, but
it must be regarded as a poetical figure; that we may understand that men were so liberal,
that they did not shut up the fruits of the earth produced for them, nor did they in solitude
brood over the things stored up, but admitted the poor to share the fruits of their labour:—
<lg>
<l>“Now streams of milk, now streams of nectar flowed.”959</l>
</lg>
And no wonder, since the storehouses of the good liberally lay open to all. Nor did avarice
intercept the divine bounty, and thus cause hunger and thirst in common; but all alike had
abundance, since they who had possessions gave liberally and bountifully to those who had
not. But after that Saturnus had been banished from heaven, and had arrived in Latium,—
<lg>
<l>“Exiled from his throne</l>
<l>By Jove, his mightier heir,”960—</l>
</lg>
since the people either through fear of the new king, or of their own accord, had become
corrupted and ceased to worship God, and had begun to esteem the king in the place of
God, since he himself, almost a parricide, was an example to others to the injury of piety,—
<lg>
<l>“The most just Virgin in haste deserted the lands;”961</l>

For how could she settle or tarry in the kingdom of him who expelled his father from his

<lg>
<l>“He gave to the black serpents their noxious poison,</l>
<l>And ordered wolves to prowl;”965</l>
</lg>
that is, he introduced among men hatred, and envy, and stratagem; so that they were poisonous
as serpents, and rapacious as wolves. And they truly do this who persecute those who
are righteous and faithful towards God, and give to judges the power of using violence
against the innocent. Perhaps Jupiter may have done something of this kind for the overthrow
and removal of righteousness; and on this account he is related to have made serpents fierce,
and to have whetted the spirit of wolves.
<lg>
<l>“Then war’s indomitable rage,</l>
<l>And greedy lust of gain;”966</l>
</lg>
and not without reason. For the worship of God being taken away, men lost the knowledge
of good and evil. Thus the common intercourse of life perished from among then, and the
bond of human society was destroyed. Then they began to contend with one another, and
to plot, and to acquire for themselves glory from the shedding of human blood.</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.—AFTER THE BANISHMENT OF JUSTICE, LUST, UNJUST LAWS,
DARING, AVARICE, AMBITION, PRIDE, IMPIETY, AND OTHER VICES REIGNED.</head>
<p>And the source of all these evils was lust; which, indeed, burst forth from the contempt
of true majesty. For not only did they who had a superfluity fail to bestow a share upon
others, but they even seized the property of others, drawing everything to their private gain;
and the things which formerly even individuals laboured to obtain for the common use of
men,967 were now conveyed to the houses of a few. For, that they might subdue others by
slavery, they began especially to withdraw and collect together the necessaries of life, and
to keep them firmly shut up, that they might make the bounties of heaven their own; not
on account of kindness,968 a feeling which had no existence in them, but that they might
sweep together all the instruments of lust and avarice. They also, under the name of justice,
passed most unequal and unjust laws, by which they might defend their plunder and avarice
against the force of the multitude. They prevailed, therefore, as much by authority as by
strength, or resources, or malice. And since there was in them no trace of justice, the offices
of which are humanity, equity, pity, they now began to rejoice in a proud and swollen inequality,
and made969 themselves higher than other men, by a retinue of attendants, and
by the sword, and by the brilliancy of their garments. For this reason they invented for
themselves honours, and purple robes, and fasces, that, being supported by the terror produced
by axes and swords, they might, as it were by the right of masters, rule them, stricken
with fear, and alarmed. Such was the condition in which the life of man was placed by that
king who, having defeated and put to flight a parent, did not seize his kingdom, but set up
an impious tyranny by violence and armed men, and took away that golden age of justice,
and compelled men to become wicked and impious, even from this very circumstance, that
he turned them away from God to the worship of himself; and the terror of his excessive
power had extorted this.</p>
<p>For who would not fear him who was girded about with arms, whom the unwonted
gleam of steel and swords surrounded? Or what stranger would he spare who had not even
spared his own father? Whom, in truth, should he fear, who had conquered in war, and
destroyed by massacre the race of the Titans, which was strong and excelling in might? What
wonder if the whole multitude, pressed by unusual fear, had given themselves up to the adulation
of a single man? Him they venerated, to him they paid the greatest honour. And
since it is judged to be a kind of obsequiousness to imitate the customs and vices of a king,
all men laid aside piety, lest, if they should live piously, they might seem to upbraid the
wickedness of the king. Thus, being corrupted by continual imitation, they abandoned divine

right, and the practice of living wickedly by degrees became a habit. And now nothing remained
of the pious and excellent condition of the preceding age; but justice being banished,
and drawing with her the truth, left to men error, ignorance, and blindness. The poets
therefore were ignorant, who sung that she fled to heaven, to the kingdom of Jupiter. For
if justice was on the earth in the age which they call “golden,” it is plain that she was driven
away by Jupiter, who changed the golden age. But the change of the age and the expulsion
of justice is to be deemed nothing else, as I have said, than the laying aside of divine religion,
which alone effects that man should esteem man dear, and should know that he is bound
to him by the tie of brotherhood, since God is alike a Father to all, so as to share the bounties
of the common God and Father with those who do not possess them; to injure no one, to
oppress no one, not to close his door against a stranger, nor his ear against a suppliant, but
to be bountiful, beneficent, and liberal, which Tullius970 thought to be praises suitable to a
king. This truly is justice, and this is the golden age, which was first corrupted when Jupiter
reigned, and shortly afterwards, when he himself and all his offspring were consecrated as
gods, and the worship of many deities undertaken, had been altogether taken away.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF THE COMING OF JESUS, AND ITS FRUIT; AND OF THE VIRTUES
AND VICES OF THAT AGE.</head>
<p>But God, as a most indulgent parent, when the last time approached, sent a messenger
to bring back that old age, and justice which had been put to flight, that the human race
might not be agitated by very great and perpetual errors. Therefore the appearance of that
golden time returned, and justice was restored to the earth, but was assigned to a few; and
this justice is nothing else than the pious and religious worship of the one God. But perhaps
some may be inclined to ask, why, if this be justice, it is not given to all mankind, and the
whole multitude does not agree to it. This is a matter of great disputation, why a difference
was retained by God when He gave justice to the earth; and this I have shown in another
place, and whenever a favourable opportunity shall occur it shall be explained. Now it is
sufficient very briefly to signify it: that virtue can neither be discerned, unless it has vices
opposed to it; nor be perfect, unless it is exercised by adversity.971 For God designed that
there should be this distinction between good and evil things, that we may know from that
which is evil the quality of the good, and also the quality of the evil from the good; nor can
the nature of the one be understood if the other is taken away. God therefore did not exclude
evil, that the nature of virtue might be evident. For how could patient endurance972 retain
its meaning and name if there were nothing which we were compelled to endure?973 How
could faith devoted to its God deserve praise, unless there were some one who wished to
turn us away from God? For on this account He permitted the unjust to be more powerful,
that they might be able to compel to evil; and on this account to be more numerous, that
virtue might be precious, because it is rare. And this very point is admirably and briefly
shown by Quintilian in “the muffled head.”974 “For what virtue,” he says, “would there be
in innocence, had not its rarity furnished it with praises? But because it is provided by nature
that hatred, desire, and anger drive men blindly to that object to which they have applied
themselves, to be free from fault appears to be beyond the power of man. Otherwise, if nature
had given to all men equal affections, piety would be nothing.”</p>
<p>How true this is, the necessity of the case itself teaches. For if it is virtue to resist with
fortitude evils and vices, it is evident that, without evil and vice, there is no perfected virtue;
and that God might render this complete and perfect, He retained that which was contrary
to it, with which it might contend. For, being agitated by evils which harass it, it gains sta-

bility; and in proportion to the frequency with which it is urged onward, is the firmness
with which it is strengthened. This is evidently the cause which effects that, although justice
is sent to men, yet it cannot be said that a golden age exists; because God has not taken away
evil, that He might retain that diversity which alone preserves the mystery of a divine religion.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF JUSTICE KNOWN TO ALL, BUT NOT EMBRACED; OF THE TRUE
TEMPLE OF GOD, AND OF HIS WORSHIP, THAT ALL VICES MAY BE SUBDUED.</head>
<p>They, therefore, who think that no one is just, have justice before their eyes, but are
unwilling to discern it. For what reason is there why they should describe it either in poems
or in all their discourse, complaining of its absence, when it is very easy for them to be good
if they wish? Why do you depict to yourselves justice as worthless,975 and wish that she may
fall from heaven, as it were, represented in some image? Behold, she is in your sight; receive
her, if you are able, and place her in the abode of your breast; and do not imagine that this
is difficult, or unsuited to the times. Be just and good, and the justice which you seek will
follow you of her own accord. Lay aside every evil thought from your hearts, and that golden
age will at once return to you, which you cannot attain to by any other means than by beginning
to worship the true God. But you long for justice on the earth, while the worship of
false gods continues, which cannot possibly come to pass. But it was not possible even at
that time when you imagine, because those deities whom you impiously worship were not
yet produced, and the worship of the one God must have prevailed throughout the earth;
of that God, I say, who hates wickedness and requires goodness; whose temple is not stones
or clay, but man himself, who bears the image of God. And this temple is adorned not with
corruptible gifts of gold and jewels, but with the lasting offices of virtues. Learn, therefore,
if any intelligence is left to you, that men are wicked and unjust because gods are worshipped;
and that all evils daily increase to the affairs of men on this account, because God the Maker
and Governor of this world has been neglected; because, contrary to that which is right,
impious superstitions have been taken up; and lastly, because you do not permit God to be
worshipped even by a few.</p>
<p>But if God only were worshipped, there would not be dissensions and wars, since men
would know that they are the sons of one God; and, therefore, among those who were connected
by the sacred and inviolable bond of divine relationship, there would be no plottings,
inasmuch as they would know what kind of punishments God prepared for the destroyers
of souls, who sees through secret crimes, and even the very thoughts themselves. There
would be no frauds or plunderings if they had learned, through the instruction of God, to
be content with that which was their own, though little, so that they might prefer solid and
eternal things to those which are frail and perishable. There would be no adulteries, and
debaucheries, and prostitution of women, if it were known to all, that whatever is sought
beyond the desire of procreation is condemned by God.976 Nor would necessity compel a
woman to dishonour her modesty, to seek for herself a most disgraceful mode of sustenance;

since the males also would restrain their lust, and the pious and religious contributions of
the rich would succour the destitute. There would not, therefore, as I have said, be these
evils on the earth, if there were by common consent a general observance977 of the law of
God, if those things were done by all which our people alone perform. How happy and how
golden would be the condition of human affairs, if throughout the world gentleness, and
piety, and peace, and innocence, and equity, and temperance, and faith, took up their abode!
In short, there would be no need of so many and varying laws to rule men, since the law of
God alone would be sufficient for perfect innocence; nor would there be any need of prisons,
or the swords of rulers, or the terror of punishments, since the wholesomeness of the divine
precepts infused into the breasts of men would of itself instruct them to works of justice.
But now men are wicked through ignorance of what is right and good. And this, indeed,
Cicero saw; for, discoursing on the subject of the laws,978 he says: “As the world, with all its
parts agreeing with one another, coheres and depends upon one and the same nature, so all
men, being naturally confused among themselves, disagree through depravity; nor do they
understand that they are related by blood, and that they are all subject to one and the same
guardianship: for if this were kept in mind, assuredly men would live the life of gods.”
Therefore the unjust and impious worship of the gods has introduced all the evils by which
mankind in turn destroy one another. For they could not retain their piety, who, as prodigal
and rebellious children, had renounced the authority of God, the common parent of all.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE CRIMES OF THE WICKED, AND THE TORTURE INFLICTED
ON THE CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>At times, however, they perceive that they are wicked, and praise the condition of the
former ages, and conjecture that justice is absent because of their characters and deserts;
for, though she presents herself to their eyes, they not only fail to receive or recognise her,
but they even violently hate, and persecute, and endeavour to banish her. Let us suppose,
in the meantime, that she whom we follow is not justice: how will they receive her whom
they imagine to be the true justice, if she shall have come, when they torture and kill those
whom they themselves confess to be imitators of the just, because they perform good and
just actions; whereas, if they should put to death the wicked only, they would deserve to be
unvisited by justice, who had no other reason for leaving the earth than the shedding of
human blood? How much more so when they slay the righteous, and account the followers
of justice themselves as enemies, yea, as more than enemies; who, though they eagerly seek
their lives, and property, and children by sword and fire, yet are spared when conquered;
and there is a place for clemency even amidst arms; or if they have determined to carry their
cruelty to the utmost, nothing more is done towards them, except that they are put to death
or led away to slavery! But this is unutterable which is done towards those who are ignorant
of crime, and none are regarded as more guilty than those who are of all men innocent.
Therefore most wicked men venture to make mention of justice, men who surpass wild
beasts in ferocity, who lay waste the most gentle flock of God,—
<lg>
<l>“Like gaunt wolves rushing from their den,</l>
<l>Whom lawless hunger’s sullen growl</l>
<l>Drives forth into the night to prowl.”979</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But these have been maddened not by the fury of hunger, but of the heart; nor do they
prowl in a black mist, but by open plundering; nor does the consciousness of their crimes
ever recall them from profaning the sacred and holy name of justice with that mouth which,
like the jaws of beasts, is wet with the blood of the innocent. What must we say is especially
the cause of this excessive and persevering hatred?
<lg>
<l>“Does truth produce hatred,”980</l>
</lg>
as the poet says, as though inspired by the Divine Spirit, or are they ashamed to be bad in
the presence of the just and good? Or is it rather from both causes? For the truth is always
hateful on this account, because he who sins wishes to have free scope for sinning, and thinks
<note type="footnote">979 Virg., Æn., ii. 355.</note>
<note type="footnote">980 Ter., Andr., i. 1, 41.</note>

<pb n="320"/>
that he cannot in any other way more securely enjoy the pleasure of his evil doings, than if
there is no one whom his faults may displease. Therefore they endeavour entirely to exterminate
and take them away as witnesses of their crimes and wickedness, and think them
burthensome to themselves, as though their life were reproved. For why should any be unseasonably
good, who, when the public morals are corrupted, should censure them by living
well? Why should not all be equally wicked, rapacious, unchaste, adulterers, perjured, covetous,
and fraudulent? Why should they not rather be taken out of the way, in whose presence
they are ashamed to lead an evil life, who, though not by words, for they are silent, but by
their very course of life, so unlike their own, assail and strike the forehead of sinners? For
whoever disagrees with them appears to reprove them.</p>
<p>Nor is it greatly to be wondered at if these things are done towards men, since for the
same cause the people who were placed in hope,981 and not ignorant of God, rose up against
God Himself; and the same necessity follows the righteous which attacked the Author of
righteousness Himself. Therefore they harass and torment them with studied kinds of
punishments, and think it little to kill those whom they hate, unless cruelty also mocks their
bodies. But if any through fear of pain or death, or by their own perfidy, have deserted the
heavenly oath,982 and have consented to deadly sacrifices, these they praise and load983 with
honours, that by their example they may allure others. But upon those who have highly esteemed
their faith, and have not denied that they are worshippers of God, they fall with all
the strength of their butchery, as though they thirsted for blood; and they call them desperate,
984 because they by no means spare their body; as though anything could be more desperate,
than to torture and tear in pieces him whom you know to be innocent. Thus no sense
of shame remains among those from whom all kind feeling is absent, and they retort upon
just men reproaches which are befitting to themselves. For they call them impious, being
themselves forsooth pious, and shrinking from the shedding of human blood; whereas, if
they would consider their own acts, and the acts of those whom they condemn as impious,
they would now understand how false they are, and more deserving of all those things which
they either say or do against the good. For they are not of our number, but of theirs who
besiege the roads in arms, practice piracy by sea; or if it has not been in their power openly
to assail, secretly mix poisons; who kill their wives that they may gain their dowries, or their
husbands that they may marry adulterers; who either strangle the sons born from themselves,

or if they are too pious, expose them; who restrain their incestuous passions neither from
a daughter, nor sister, nor mother, nor priestess; who conspire against their own citizens
and country; who do not fear the sack;985 who, in fine, commit sacrilege, and despoil the
temples of the gods whom they worship; and, to speak of things which are light and usually
practised by them, who hunt for inheritances, forge wills, either remove or exclude the just
heirs; who prostitute their own persons to lust; who, in short, unmindful of what they were
born, contend with women in passivity;986 who, in violation of all propriety,987 pollute and
dishonour the most sacred part of their body; who mutilate themselves, and that which is
more impious, in order that they may be priests of religion; who do not even spare their
own life, but sell their lives to be taken away in public; who, if they sit as judges, corrupted
by a bribe, either destroy the innocent or set free the guilty without punishment; who grasp
at the heaven itself by sorceries, as though the earth would not contain their wickedness.
These crimes, I say, and more than these, are plainly committed by those who are worshippers
of the gods.</p>
<p>Amidst these crimes of such number and magnitude, what place is there for justice?
And I have collected a few only out of many, not for the purpose of censure, but to show
their nature. Let those who shall wish to know all take in hand the books of Seneca, who
was at the same time a most true describer and a most vehement accuser of the public
morals and vices. But Lucilius also briefly and concisely described that dark life in these
verses: “But now from morn to night, on festival and ordinary day alike, the whole people
and the fathers with one accord display themselves in988 the forum, and never depart from
it. They have all given themselves to one and the same pursuit and art, that they may be able
cautiously to deceive, to fight treacherously, to contend in flattery, each to pretend that he
is a good man, to lie in wait, as if all were enemies to all.” But which of these things can be
laid to the charge of our people,989 with whom the whole of religion consists in living without
guilt and without spot? Since, therefore, they see that both they and their people do those
things which we have said, but that ours practice nothing else but that which is just and
good, they might, if they had any understanding, have perceived from this, both that they
who do what is good are pious, and that they themselves who commit wicked actions are

impious. For it is impossible that they who do not err in all the actions of their life, should
err in the main point, that is, in religion, which is the chief of all things. For impiety, if taken
up in that which is the most important, would follow through all the rest. And therefore990
it is impossible that they who err in the whole of their life should not be deceived also in
religion; inasmuch as piety, if it kept its rule in the chief point, would maintain its course
in others. Thus it happens, that on either side the character of the main subject may be
known from the state of the actions which are carried on.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF FALSE PIETY, AND OF FALSE AND TRUE RELIGION.</head>
<p>It is worth while to investigate their piety, that from their merciful and pious actions it
may be understood what is the character of those things which are done by them contrary
to the laws of piety. And that I may not seem to attack any one with harshness, I will take a
character from the poets, and one which is the greatest example of piety. In Maro, that king
<lg>
<l>“Than who</l>
<l>The breath of being none e’er drew,</l>
<l>More brave, more pious, or more true,”991—</l>
</lg>
what proofs of justice did he bring forward to us?
<lg>
<l>“There walk with hands fast bound behind</l>
<l>The victim prisoners, designed</l>
<l rend=" indent">For slaughter o’er the flames.”992</l>
</lg>
What can be more merciful than this piety? what more merciful than to immolate human
victims to the dead, and to feed the fire with the blood of men as with oil? But perhaps this
may not have been the fault of the hero himself, but of the poet, who polluted with distinguished
wickedness “a man distinguished by his piety.”993 Where then, O poet, is that piety
which you so frequently praise? Behold the pious Æneas:—
<lg>
<l>“Four hapless youths of Sulmo’s breed,</l>
<l rend=" indent">And four who Ufens call their sire,</l>
<l>He takes alive, condemned to bleed</l>
<l rend=" indent">To Pallas’ shade on Pallas’ pyre.”994</l>
</lg>
Why, therefore, at the very same time when he was sending the men in chains to slaughter,
did he say,
<lg>
<l>“Fain would I grant the living peace,”995</l>
</lg>

<pb n="324"/>
when he ordered that those whom he had in his power alive should be slain in the place of
cattle? But this, as I have said, was not his fault—for he perhaps had not received a liberal
education—but yours; for, though you were learned, yet you were ignorant of the nature of
piety, and you believed that that wicked and detestable action of his was the befitting exercise
of piety. He is plainly called pious on this account only, because he loved his father. Why
should I say that
<lg>
<l>“The good Æneas owned their plea,”996</l>
</lg>
and yet slew them? For, though adjured by the same father, and
<lg>
<l>“By young Iulus’ dawning day,”997</l>
</lg>
he did not spare them,
<lg>
<l>“Live fury kindling every vein”998</l>
</lg>
What! can any one imagine that there was any virtue in him who was fired with madness
as stubble, and, forgetful of the shade of his father, by whom he was entreated, was unable
to curb his wrath? He was therefore by no means pious who not only slew the unresisting,
but even suppliants. Here some one will say: What then, or where, or of what character is
piety? Truly it is among those who are ignorant of wars, who maintain concord with all,
who are friendly even to their enemies, who love all men as brethren, who know how to restrain
their anger, and to soothe every passion of the mind with calm government. How
great a mist, therefore, how great a cloud of darkness and errors, has over-spread the breasts
of men who, when they think themselves especially pious, then become especially impious?
For the more religiously they honour those earthy images, so much the more wicked are
they towards the name of the true divinity. And therefore they are often harassed with
greater evils as the reward of their impiety; and because they know not the cause of these
evils, the blame is altogether ascribed to fortune, and the philosophy of Epicurus finds a
place, who thinks that nothing extends to the gods, and that they are neither influenced by
favour nor moved by anger, because they often see their despisers happy, and their worshippers
in misery. And this happens on this account, because when they seem to be religious
and naturally good, they are believed to deserve nothing of that kind which they often suffer.
However, they console themselves by accusing fortune; nor do they perceive that if she had
any existence, she would never injure her worshippers. Piety of this kind is therefore de-

servedly followed by punishment; and the deity offended with the wickedness of men who
are depraved in their religious worship,999 punishes them with heavy misfortune; who, although
they live with holiness in the greatest faith and innocence, yet because they worship
gods whose impious and profane rites are an abomination to the true God, are estranged
from justice and the name of true piety. Nor is it difficult to show why the worshippers of
the gods cannot be good and just. For how shall they abstain from the shedding of blood
who worship bloodthirsty deities, Mars and Bellona? or how shall they spare their parents
who worship Jupiter, who drove out his father? or how shall they spare their own infants
who worship Saturnus? how shall they uphold chastity who worship a goddess who is naked,
and an adulteress, and who prostitutes herself as it were among the gods? how shall they
withhold themselves from plunder and frauds who are acquainted with the thefts of
Mercurius, who teaches that to deceive is not the part of fraud, but of cleverness? how shall
they restrain their lusts who worship Jupiter, Hercules, Liber, Apollo, and the others, whose
adulteries and debaucheries with men and women are not only known to the learned, but
are even set forth in the theatres, and made the subject of songs, so that they are notorious1000
to all? Among these things is it possible for men to be just, who, although they were naturally
good, would be trained to injustice by the very gods themselves? For, that you may propitiate
the god whom you worship, there is need of those things with which you know that he is
pleased and delighted. Thus it comes to pass that the god fashions the life of his worshippers
according to the character of his own will,1001 since the most religious worship is to imitate.</p>

<head>CHAP XI.—OF THE CRUELTY OF THE HEATHENS AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>Therefore, because justice is burthensome and unpleasant to those men who agree with
the character of their gods, they exercise with violence against the righteous the same impiety
which they show in other things. And not without reason are they spoken of by the prophets
as beasts. Therefore it is excellently said by Marcus Tullius:1002 “For if there is no one who
would not prefer to die than to be changed into the figure of a beast, although he is about
to have the mind of a man, how much more wretched is it to be of a brutalized mind in the
figure of a man! To me, indeed, it seems as much worse as the mind is more excellent than
the body.” Therefore they view with disdain the bodies of beasts, though they are themselves
more cruel than these; and they pride themselves on this account, that they were born men,
though they have nothing belonging to man except the features and the eminent figure. For
what Caucasus, what India, what Hyrcania ever nourished beasts so savage and so
bloodthirsty? For the fury of all wild beasts rages until their appetite is satisfied; and when
their hunger is appeased, immediately is pacified. That is truly a beast by whose command
alone
<lg>
<l>“With rivulets of slaughter reeks</l>
<l rend=" indent">The stern embattled field.”</l>
<l>“Dire agonies, wild terrors swarm,</l>
<l rend=" indent">And Death glares grim in many a form.”1003</l>
</lg>
No one can befittingly describe the cruelty of this beast, which reclines in one place, and yet
rages with iron teeth throughout the world, and not only tears in pieces the limbs of men,
but also breaks their very bones, and rages over their ashes, that there may be no place for
their burial, as though they who confess God aimed at this, that their tombs should be visited,
and not rather that they themselves may reach the presence of God.</p>
<p>What brutality is it, what fury, what madness, to deny light to the living, earth to the
dead? I say, therefore, that nothing is more wretched than those men whom necessity has
either found or made the ministers of another’s fury, the satellites of an impious command.
For that was no honour, or exaltation of dignity, but the condemnation of a man to torture,
and also to the everlasting punishment of God. But it is impossible to relate what things
they performed individually throughout the world. For what number of volumes will contain
so infinite, so varied kinds of cruelty? For, having gained power, every one raged according
to his own disposition. Some, through excessive timidity, proceeded to greater lengths than
they were commanded; others thus acted through their own particular hatred against the
righteous; some by a natural ferocity of mind; some through a desire to please, and that by
<note type="footnote">1002 [De Republica, iv. i. 3.]</note>

this service they might prepare the way to higher offices: some were swift to slaughter, as
an individual in Phrygia, who burnt a whole assembly of people, together with their place
of meeting. But the more cruel he was, so much the more merciful1004 is he found to be.
But that is the worst kind of persecutors whom a false appearance of clemency flatters; he is
the more severe, he the more cruel torturer, who determines to put no one to death.
Therefore it cannot be told what great and what grievous modes of tortures judges of this
kind devised, that they might arrive at the accomplishment of their purpose. But they do
these things not only on this account, that they may be able to boast that they have slain
none of the innocent,—for I myself have heard some boasting that their administration has
been in this respect without bloodshed,—but also for the sake of envy, lest either they
themselves should be overcome, or the others should obtain the glory due to their virtue.
And thus, in devising modes of punishment, they think of nothing else besides victory. For
they know that this is a contest and a battle. I saw in Bithynia the præfect wonderfully elated
with joy, as though he had subdued some nation of barbarians, because one who had resisted
for two years with great spirit appeared at length to yield. They contend, therefore, that they
may conquer and inflict exquisite1005 pains on their bodies, and avoid nothing else but that
the victims may not die under the torture: as though, in truth, death alone could make them
happy, and as though tortures also in proportion to their severity would not produce
greater glory of virtue. But they with obstinate folly give orders that diligent care shall be
given to the tortured, that their limbs may be renovated for other tortures, and fresh blood
be supplied for punishment. What can be so pious, so beneficent, so humane? They would
not have bestowed such anxious care on any whom they loved. This is the discipline of the
gods: to these deeds they train their worshippers; these are the sacred rites which they require.
Moreover, most wicked murderers have invented impious laws against the pious. For both
sacrilegious ordinances and unjust disputations of jurists are read. Domitius, in his seventh
book, concerning the office of the proconsul, has collected wicked rescripts of princes, that
he might show by what punishments they ought to be visited who confessed themselves to
be worshippers of God.</p>

and cruelty, wish to appear just and prudent, being blind and dull, and ignorant of

of ours—we embrace this. We believe that this is expedient for us,—to love you, and to
confer all things upon you, who hate us.</p>
<p>There is in the writings of Cicero1007 a passage not inconsistent with the truth, in that
disputation which is held by Furius against justice: “I ask,” he says, “if there should be two
men, and one of them should be an excellent man, of the highest integrity, the greatest
justice, and remarkable faith, and the other distinguished by crime and audacity; and if the
state should be in such error as to regard that good man as wicked, vicious, and execrable,
but should think the one who is most wicked to be of the highest integrity and faith; and if,
in accordance with this opinion of all the citizens, that good man should be harassed, dragged
away, should be deprived of his hands, have his eyes dug out, should be condemned, be
bound, be branded, be banished, be in want, and lastly, should most justly appear to all to
be most wretched; but, on the other hand, if that wicked man should be praised, and honoured,
and loved by all,—if all honours, all commands, all wealth, and all abundance should
be bestowed upon him,—in short, if he should be judged in the estimation of all an excellent
man, and most worthy of all fortune,—who, I pray, will be so mad as to doubt which of the
two he would prefer to be?” Assuredly he put forth this example as though he divined what
evils were about to happen to us, and in what manner, on account of righteousness; for our
people suffer all these things through the perverseness of those in error. Behold, the state,
or rather the whole world itself, is in such error, that it persecutes, tortures, condemns, and
puts to death good and righteous men, as though they were wicked and impious. For as to
what he says, that no one is so infatuated as to doubt which of the two he would prefer to
be, he indeed, as the one who was contending against justice, thought this, that the wise
<note type="footnote">1006 Ne morte quidem simplici dignum putetis.</note>
<note type="footnote">1007 [From the Republic, iii. xvii. 27.]</note>

<pb n="329"/>
man would prefer to be bad if he had a good reputation, than to be good with a bad reputation.</p>
<p>But may this senselessness be absent from us, that we should prefer that which is false
to the true? Or does the character of our good man depend upon the errors of the people,
more than upon our own conscience and the judgment of God? Or shall any prosperity ever
allure us, so that we should not rather choose true goodness, though accompanied with all
evil, than false goodness together with all prosperity? Let kings retain their kingdoms, the
rich their riches, as Plautus says,1008 the wise their wisdom; let them leave to us our folly,
which is evidently proved to be wisdom, from the very fact that they envy us its possession:
for who would envy a fool, but he who is himself most foolish? But they are not so foolish
as to envy fools; but from the fact of their following us up with such care and anxiety, they
allow that we are not fools. For why should they rage with such cruelty, unless it is that they
fear lest, as justice grows strong from day to day, they should be deserted together with their
decaying1009 gods? If, therefore, the worshippers of gods are wise, and we are foolish, why
do they fear lest the wise shall be allured by the foolish?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.—OF THE INCREASE AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE

<p>But since our number is continually increased from the worshippers of gods, but is
never lessened, not even in persecution itself,—since men may commit sin, and be defiled
by sacrifice, but they cannot be turned away from God, for the truth prevails by its own
power,—who is there, I pray, so foolish and so blind as not to see on which side wisdom is?
But they are blinded by malice and fury, that they cannot see; and they think that those are
foolish who, when they have it in their power to avoid punishments, nevertheless prefer to
be tortured and to be put to death; whereas they might see from this very circumstance, that
it is not folly to which so many thousands throughout the world agree with one and the
same mind. For if women fall into error through the weakness of their sex (for these persons
sometimes call it a womanish and anile superstition), men doubtless are wise. If boys, if
youths are improvident through their age, the mature and aged doubtless have a fixed
judgment. If one city is unwise, it is evident that the other innumerable cities cannot be
foolish. If one province or one nation is without prudence, the rest must have understanding
of that which is right. But since the divine law has been received from the rising even to the
setting of the sun, and each sex, every age, and nation, and country, with one and the same
mind obeys God—since there is everywhere the same patient endurance, the same contempt
of death—they ought to have understood that there is some reason in that matter, that it is
not without a cause that it is defended even to death, that there is some foundation and
solidity, which not only frees that religion from injuries and molestation, but always increases
and makes it stronger. For in this respect also the malice of those is brought to light, who
think that they have utterly overthrown the religion of God if they have corrupted men,
when it is permitted them to make satisfaction also to God; and there is no worshipper of
God so evil who does not, when the opportunity is given him, return to appease God, and
that, too, with greater devotedness. For the consciousness of sin and the fear of punishment
make a man more religious, and the faith is always much stronger which is replaced through
repentance. If, therefore, they themselves, when they think that the gods are angry with
them, nevertheless believe that they are appeased by gifts, and sacrifices, and incense, what
reason is there why they should imagine our God to be so unmerciful and implacable, that
it should appear impossible for him to be a Christian, who by compulsion and against his
will has poured a libation to their gods? Unless by chance they think that those who are
once contaminated are about to change their mind, so that they may now begin of their
own accord to do that which they have done under the influence of torture. Who would
willingly undertake that duty which began with injury? Who, when he sees the scars on his
own sides, would not the more hate the gods, on account of whom he bears the traces of
<note type="footnote">1010 [VOL. IV. P. 116; SAME VOL., P. 125.]</note>

<pb n="331"/>
lasting punishment, and the marks imprinted upon his flesh? Thus it comes to pass, that
when peace is given from heaven, those who were estranged1011 from us return, and a fresh
crowd1012 of others are added on account of the wonderful nature1013 of the virtue displayed.
For when the people see that men are lacerated by various kinds of tortures, and that they
retain their patience unsubdued while the executioners are wearied, they think, as is really
the case, that neither the agreement of so many nor the constancy of the dying is without
meaning, and that patience itself could not surmount such great tortures without the aid of
God. Robbers and men of robust frame are unable to endure lacerations of this kind: they
utter exclamations, and send forth groans; for they are overcome by pain, because they are
destitute of patience infused1014 into them. But in our case (not to speak of men), boys and
delicate women in silence overpower their torturers, and even the fire is unable to extort
from them a groan. Let the Romans go and boast in their Mutius or Regulus,—the one of
whom gave himself up to be slain by the enemy, because he was ashamed to live as a captive;
the other being taken by the enemy, when he saw that he could not escape death, laid his
hand upon the burning hearth, that he might make atonement for his crime to the enemy
whom he wished to kill, and by that punishment received the pardon which he had not deserved.
Behold, the weak sex and fragile age endure to be lacerated in the whole body, and
to be burned: not of necessity, for it is permitted them to escape if they wished to do so; but
of their own will, because they put their trust in God.1015</p>

<p>But this is true virtue, which the vaunting philosophers also boast of, not in deed, but
with empty words, saying that nothing is so befitting the gravity and constancy of a wise
man as to be able to be driven away from his sentiment and purpose by no torturers, but
that it is worth his while1016 to suffer torture and death rather than betray a trust or depart
from his duty, or, overcome by fear of death or severity of pain, commit any injustice. Unless
by chance Flaccus appears to them to rave in his lyrics, when he says,
<lg>
<l>“Not the rage of the million commanding things evil;</l>
<l>Not the doom frowning near in the brows of the tyrant,</l>
<l>Shakes the upright and resolute man</l>
<l>In his solid completeness of soul.”1017</l>
</lg>
And nothing can be more true than this, if it is referred to those who refuse no tortures, no
kind of death, that they may not turn aside from faith and justice; who do not tremble at
the commands of tyrants nor the swords of rulers,1018 so as not to maintain true and solid
liberty with constancy of mind, which wisdom is to be observed in this alone. For who is so
arrogant, who so lifted up, as to forbid me to raise my eyes to heaven? Who can impose
upon me the necessity either of worshipping that which I am unwilling to worship, or of
abstaining from the worship of that which I wish to worship? What further will now be left
to us, if even this, which must be done of one’s own will,1019 shall be extorted from me by
the caprice of another? No one will effect this, if we have any courage to despise death and
pain. But if we possess this constancy, why are we judged foolish when we do those things
which philosophers praise? Seneca, in charging men with inconsistency, rightly says the
highest virtue appears to them to consist in greatness of spirit; and yet the same persons
regard him who despises death as a madman, which is plainly a mark of the greatest per-
verseness. But those followers of vain religions urge this with the same folly with which they
fail to understand the true God; and these the Erythræan Sibyl calls “deaf and senseless,”1020
since they neither hear nor perceive divine things, but fear and adore an earthen image
moulded by their own fingers.</p>

<head>CHAP. XV.—OF FOLLY, WISDOM, PIETY, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE.</head>
<p>But the reason on account of which they imagine those who are wise to be foolish has
strong grounds of support (for they are not deceived without reason). And this must be diligently
explained by us, that they may at length (if it is possible) recognise their errors.
Justice by its own nature has a certain appearance of folly, and I am able to confirm this
both by divine and human testimonies. But perhaps we should not succeed with them, unless
we should teach them from their own authorities that no one can be just, a matter which is
united with true wisdom, unless he also appears to be foolish. Carneades was a philosopher
of the Academic sect; and one who knows not what power he had in discussion, what eloquence,
what sagacity, will nevertheless understand the character of the man himself from
the praises of Cicero or of Lucilius, in whose writings Neptune, discoursing on a subject of
the greatest difficulty, shows that it cannot be explained, even if Orcus should restore
Carneades himself to life. This Carneades, when he had been sent by the Athenians as ambassador
to Rome, disputed copiously on the subject of justice, in the hearing of Galba and
Cato, who had been censor, who were at that time the greatest of orators. But on the next
day the same man overthrew his own argument by a disputation to the contrary effect, and
took away the justice which he had praised on the preceding day, not indeed with the gravity
of a philosopher, whose prudence ought to be firm and his opinion settled, but as it were
by an oratorical kind of exercise of disputing on both sides. And he was accustomed to do
this, that he might be able to refute others who asserted anything. L. Furius, in Cicero, makes
mention of that discussion in which justice is overthrown.1021 I believe, inasmuch as he was
discussing the subject of the state, he did it that he might introduce the defence and praise
of that without which he thought that a state could not be governed. But Carneades, that
he might refute Aristotle and Plato, the advocates of justice, in that first disputation collected
all the arguments which were alleged in behalf of justice, that he might be able to overthrow
them, as he did. For it was very easy to shake justice, having no roots, inasmuch as there
was then none on the earth, that its nature or qualities might be perceived by philosophers.
And I could wish that men, so many and of such a character, had possessed knowledge also,
in proportion to their eloquence and spirit, for completing the defence of this greatest virtue,
which has its origin in religion, its principle in equity! But those who were ignorant of that
first part could not possess the second. But I wish first to show, summarily and concisely,
what it is, that it may be understood that the philosophers were ignorant of justice, and were
unable to defend that with which they were unacquainted. Although justice embraces all
the virtues together, yet there are two, the chief of all, which cannot be torn asunder and
separated from it—piety and equity. For fidelity, temperance, uprightness, innocence, integrity,
and the other things of this kind, either naturally or through the training of parents,
<note type="footnote">1021 [See Rep., iii. cap. 6, part iv. vol. 2, p. 300, ed. Klotz.]</note>

<pb n="334"/>
may exist in those men who are ignorant of justice, as they have always existed; for the ancient
Romans, who were accustomed to glory in justice, used evidently to glory in those virtues
which (as I have said) may proceed from justice, and be separated from the very fountain
itself. But piety and equity are, as it were, its veins: for in these two fountains the whole of
justice is contained; but its source and origin is in the first, all its force and method in the
second. But piety is nothing else but the conception1022 of God, as Trismegistus most truly
defined it, as we have said in another place. If, therefore, it is piety to know God, and the
sum of this knowledge is that you worship Him, it is plain that he is ignorant of justice who
does not possess the knowledge of God. For how can he know justice itself, who is ignorant
of the source from which it arises? Plato, indeed, spoke many things respecting the one God,
by whom he said that the world was framed; but he spoke nothing respecting religion: for
he had dreamed of God, but had not known Him. But if either he himself or any other person
had wished to complete the defence of justice, he ought first of all to have overthrown the
religions of the gods, because they are opposed to piety. And because Socrates indeed tried
to do this, he was thrown into prison; that even then it might be seen what was about to
happen to those men who had begun to defend true justice, and to serve the only God.</p>
<p>The other part of justice, therefore, is equity; and it is plain that I am not speaking of
the equity of judging well, though this also is praiseworthy in a just man, but of making
himself equal to others, which Cicero calls equability.1023 For God, who produces and gives
breath to men, willed that all should be equal, that is, equally matched.1024 He has imposed
on all the same condition of living; He has produced all to wisdom; He has promised immortality
to all; no one is cut off from His heavenly benefits. For as He distributes to all alike
His one light, sends forth His fountains to all, supplies food, and gives the most pleasant
rest of sleep; so He bestows on all equity and virtue. In His sight no one is a slave, no one a
master; for if all have the same Father, by an equal right we are all children. No one is poor
in the sight of God, but he who is without justice; no one is rich, but he who is full of virtues;
no one, in short, is excellent, but he who has been good and innocent; no one is most
renowned, but he who has abundantly performed works of mercy; no one is most perfect,
but he who has filled all the steps of virtue. Therefore neither the Romans nor the Greeks
could possess justice, because they had men differing from one another by many degrees,
from the poor to the rich, from the humble to the powerful; in short, from private persons
to the highest authorities of kings. For where all are not equally matched, there is not equity;
and inequality of itself excludes justice, the whole force of which consists in this, that it
makes those equal who have by an equal lot arrived at the condition of this life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—OF THE DUTIES OF THE JUST MAN, AND THE EQUITY OF
CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>Therefore, since those two fountains of justice are changed, all virtue and all truth are
taken away, and justice itself returns to heaven. And on this account the true good was not
discovered by philosophers, because they were ignorant both of its origin and effects: which
has been revealed to no others but to our people.1025 Some one will say, Are there not among
you some poor, and others rich; some servants, and others masters? Is there not some difference
between individuals? There is none; nor is there any other cause why we mutually
bestow upon each other the name of brethren, except that we believe ourselves to be equal.
For since we measure all human things not by the body, but by the spirit, although the
condition of bodies is different, yet we have no servants, but we both regard and speak of
them as brothers in spirit, in religion as fellow-servants. Riches also do not render men illustrious,
except that1026 they are able to make them more conspicuous by good works. For
men are rich, not because they possess riches, but because they employ them on works of
justice; and they who seem to be poor, on this account are rich, because they are not1027 in
want, and desire nothing.</p>
<p>Though, therefore, in lowliness of mind we are on an equality, the free with slaves, and
the rich with the poor, nevertheless in the sight of God we are distinguished by virtue. And
every one is more elevated in proportion to his greater justice. For if it is justice for a man
to put himself on a level even with those of lower rank, although he excels in this very thing,
that he made himself equal to his inferiors; yet if he has conducted himself not only as an
equal, but even as an inferior, he will plainly obtain a much higher rank of dignity in the
judgment of God.1028 For assuredly, since all things in this temporal life are frail and liable
to decay, men both prefer themselves to others, and contend about dignity; than which
nothing is more foul, nothing mere arrogant, nothing more removed from the conduct of
a wise man: for these earthly things are altogether opposed to heavenly things. For as the
wisdom of men is the greatest foolishness with God, and foolishness is (as I have shown)
the greatest wisdom; so he is low and abject in the sight of God who shall have been conspicuous
and elevated on earth. For, not to mention that these present earthly goods to
which great honour is paid are contrary to virtue, and enervate the vigour of the mind, what
nobility, I pray, can be so firm, what resources, what power, since God is able to make kings
themselves even lower than the lowest? And therefore God has consulted our interest in
placing this in particular among the divine precepts: “He that exalteth himself shall be abased;
<note type="footnote">1025 [Cap. xv. p. 150, supra ]</note>
<note type="footnote">1026 Nisi quòd. Some editions read, “nisi quos,” except those whom, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">1027 Quia non egent. Some editors omit non; but this is not so good.</note>
<note type="footnote">1028 [Jas. i. 9, 10, and ii. 1–8.]</note>

<pb n="336"/>
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”1029 And the wholesomeness of this precept
teaches that he who shall simply place himself on a level with other men, and carry himself
with humility, is esteemed excellent and illustrious in the sight of God. For the sentiment
is not false which is brought forward in Euripides to this effect:—</p>
<p>“The things which are here considered evil are esteemed good in heaven.”</p>

<pb n="337"/>
<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF THE EQUITY, WISDOM, AND FOOLISHNESS OF CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>I have explained the reason why philosophers were unable either to find or to defend
justice. Now I return to that which I had purposed. Carneades, therefore, since the arguments
of the philosophers were weak, undertook the bold task of refuting them, because he understood
that they were capable of refutation. The substance of his disputation was this: “That
men1030 enacted laws for themselves, with a view to their own advantage, differing indeed
according to their characters, and in the case of the same persons often changed according
to the times: but that there was no natural law: that all, both men and other animals, were
borne by the guidance of nature to their own advantage; therefore that there was no justice,
or if any did exist, it was the greatest folly, because it injured itself by promoting the interests
of others.” And he brought forward these arguments: “That all nations which flourished
with dominion, even the Romans themselves, who were masters of the whole world, if they
wish to be just, that is, to restore the possessions of others, must return to cottages, and lie
down in want and miseries.” Then, leaving general topics, he came to particulars. “If a good
man,” he says, “has a runaway slave, or an unhealthy and infected house, and he alone knows
these faults, and on this account offers it for sale, will he give out that the slave is a runaway,
and the house which he offers for sale is infected, or will he conceal it from the purchaser?
If he shall give it out, he is good indeed, because he will not deceive; but still he will be judged
foolish, because he will either sell at a low price or not sell at all. If he shall conceal it, he will
be wise indeed, because he will consult his own interest; but he will be also wicked, because
he will deceive. Again, if he should find any one who supposes that he is selling copper ore
when it is gold, or lead when it is silver, will he be silent, that he may buy it at a small price;
or will he give information of it, so that he may buy it at a great price? It evidently appears
foolish to prefer to buy it at a great price.” From which he wished it to be understood, both
that he who is just and good is foolish, and that he who is wise is wicked; and yet that it may
possibly happen without ruin, for men to be contented with poverty. Therefore he passed
to greater things, in which no one could be just without danger of his life. For he said:
“Certainly it is justice not to put a man to death, not to take the property of another. What,
then, will the just man do, if he shall happen to have suffered shipwreck, and some one
weaker than himself shall have seized a plank? Will he not thrust him from the plank, that
he himself may get upon it, and supported by it may escape, especially since there is no
witness in the middle of the sea? If he is wise, he will do so; for he must himself perish unless
he shall thus act. But if he choose rather to die than to inflict violence upon another, in this
case he is just, but foolish, in not sparing his own life while he spares the life of another.
Thus also, if the army of his own people shall have been routed, and the enemy have begun
to press upon them, and that just man shall have met with a wounded man on horseback,
<note type="footnote">1030 [From the Republic, book iii. cap. 12, sec. 21.]</note>

<pb n="338"/>
will he spare him so as to be slain himself, or will he throw him from his horse, that he
himself may escape from the enemy? If he shall do this, he will be wise, but also wicked; if
he shall not do it, he will be just, but also of necessity foolish.” When, therefore, he had thus
divided justice into two parts, saying that the one was civil, the other natural, he subverted
both: because the civil part is wisdom, but not justice; but the natural part is justice, but not
wisdom. These arguments are altogether subtle and acute,1031 and such as Marcus Tullius
was unable to refute. For when he represents Lælius as replying to Furius, and speaking in
behalf of justice, he passed them by as a pitfall without refuting them; so that the same Lælius
appears not to have defended natural justice, which bad fallen under the charge of folly, but
that civil justice which Furius had admitted to be wisdom, but unjust.1032</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF JUSTICE, WISDOM, AND FOLLY.</head>
<p>With reference to our present discussion, I have shown how justice bears the resemblance
of folly, that it may appear that those are not deceived without reason who think that men
of our religion are foolish in appearing to do such things as he proposed. Now I perceive
that a greater undertaking is required from me, to show why God wished to enclose justice
under the appearance of folly, and to remove it from the eyes of men, when I shall have first
replied to Furius, since Lælius has not sufficiently replied to him; who, although he was a
wise man, as he was called, yet could not be the advocate of true justice, because he did not
possess the source and fountain of justice. But this defence is easier for us, to whom by the
bounty of Heaven this justice is familiar and well known, and who know it not in name, but
in reality. For Plato and Aristotle desired with an honest will to defend justice, and would
have effected something, if their good endeavours, their eloquence, and vigour of intellect
had been aided also by a knowledge of divine things. Thus their work, being vain and useless,
was neglected: nor were they able to persuade any of men to live according to their precept,
because that system had no foundation from heaven. But our work must be more certain,
since we are taught of God. For they represented justice in words, and pictured it when it
was not in sight; nor were they able to confirm their assertions by present examples. For the
hearers might have answered that it was impossible to live as they prescribed in their dispu-
tation; so that none have as yet existed who followed that course of life. But we show the
truth of our statements not only by words, but also by examples derived from the truth.
Therefore Carneades understood what is the nature of justice, except that he did not sufficiently
perceive that it was not folly; although I seem to myself to understand with what intention
he did this. For he did not really think that he who is just is foolish; but when he
knew that he was not so, but did not comprehend the cause why he appeared so, he wished
to show that the truth lay hidden, that he might maintain the dogma of his own sect,1033
the chief opinion of which is, “that nothing can be fully comprehended.”</p>
<p>Let us see, therefore, whether justice has any agreement with folly. The just man, he
says, if he does not take away from the wounded man his horse, and from the shipwrecked
man his plank, in order that he may preserve his own life, is foolish. First of all, I deny that
it can in any way happen that a man who is truly just should be in circumstances of this
kind; for the just man is neither at enmity with any human being, nor desires anything at
all which is the property of another. For why should he take a voyage, or what should he
seek from another land, when his own is sufficient for him? Or why should he carry on war,
and mix himself with the passions of others, when his mind is engaged in perpetual peace
with men? Doubtless he will be delighted with foreign merchandise or with human blood,
who does not know how to seek gain, who is satisfied with his mode of living, and considers
<note type="footnote">1033 i.e., The Academic School.</note>

<pb n="340"/>
it unlawful not only himself to commit slaughter, but to be present with those who do it,
and to behold it! But I omit these things, since it is possible that a man may be compelled
even against his will to undergo these things. Do you then, O Furius—or rather O Carneades,
for all this speech is his—think that justice is so useless, so superfluous, and so despised by
God, that it has no power and no influence in itself which may avail for its own preservation?
But it is evident that they who are ignorant of the mystery1034 of man, and who therefore
refer all things to this present life, cannot know how great is the force of justice. For when
they discuss the subject of virtue, although they understand that it is very full of labours and
miseries, nevertheless they say that it is to be sought for its own sake; for they by no means
see its rewards, which are eternal and immortal. Thus, by referring all things to the present
life, they altogether reduce virtue to folly, since it undergoes such great labours of this life
in vain and to no purpose. But more on this subject at another opportunity.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile let us speak of justice, as we began, the power of which is so great,
that when it has raised its eyes to heaven, it deserves all things from God. Flaccus therefore
rightly said, that the power of innocence is so great, that wherever it journeys, it needs
neither arms nor strength for its protection:—
<lg>
<l>“He whose life hath no flaw, pure from guile, need not borrow</l>
<l>Or the bow or the darts of the Moor, O my Fuscus!</l>
<l>He relies for defence on no quiver that teems with</l>
<l>Poison-steept arrows.</l>
<l>Though his path be along sultry African Syrtes,</l>
<l>Or Caucasian ravines, where no guest finds a shelter,</l>
<l>Or the banks which Hydaspes, the stream weird1035 with fable,</l>
<l>Licks languid-flowing.”1036</l>
</lg>
It is impossible, therefore, that amidst the dangers of tempests and of wars the just man
should be unprotected by the guardianship of Heaven; and that even if he should be at sea
in company with parricides and guilty men, the wicked also should not be spared, that this
one just and innocent soul may be freed from danger, or at any rate may be alone preserved
while the rest perish. But let us grant that the case which the philosopher proposes is possible:
what, then, will the just man do, if he shall have met with a wounded man on a horse, or a
shipwrecked man on a plank? I am not unwilling to confess he will rather die than put another
to death. Nor will justice, which is the chief good of man, on this account receive the
name of folly. For what ought to be better and dearer to man than innocence? And this must

be the more perfect, the more you bring it to extremity, and choose to die rather than to
detract from the character of innocence. It is folly, he says, to spare the life of another in a
case which involves the destruction of one’s own life. Then do you think it foolish to perish
even for friendship?</p>
<p>Why, then, are those Pythagorean friends praised by you, of whom the one gave himself
to the tyrant as a surety for the life of the other, and the other at the appointed time, when
his surety was now being led to execution, presented himself, and rescued him by his own
interposition? Whose virtue would not be held in such glory, when one of them was willing
to die for his friend, the other even for his word1037 which had been pledged, if they were
regarded as fools. In fine, on account of this very virtue the tyrant rewarded them by preserving
both, and thus the disposition of a most cruel man was changed. Moreover, it is
even said that he entreated1038 them to admit him as a third party to their friendship, from
which it is plain that he regarded them not as fools, but as good and wise men. Therefore I
do not see why, since it is reckoned the highest glory to die for friendship and for one’s
word, it is not glorious to a man to die even for his innocence. They are therefore most
foolish who impute it as a crime to us that we are willing to die for God, when they themselves
extol to the heavens with the highest praises him who was willing to die for a man. In short,
to conclude this disputation, reason itself teaches that it is impossible for a man to be at
once just and foolish, wise and unjust. For he who is foolish is unacquainted with that which
is just and good, and therefore always errs. For he is, as it were, led captive by his vices; nor
can he in any way resist them, because he is destitute of the virtue of which he is ignorant.</p>
<p>But the just man abstains from all fault, because he cannot do otherwise, although he has
the knowledge of right and wrong.
But who is able to distinguish right from wrong except the wise man? Thus it comes to
pass, that he can never be just who is foolish, nor wise who is unjust. And if this is most
true, it is plain that he who has not taken away a plank from a shipwrecked man, or a horse
from one who is wounded, is not foolish; because it is a sin to do these things, and the wise
man abstains from sin. Nevertheless I myself also confess that it has this appearance, through
the error of men, who are ignorant of the peculiar character1039 of everything. And thus
the whole of this inquiry is refuted not so much by arguments as by definition. Therefore
folly is the erring in deeds and words, through ignorance of what is right and good. Therefore
he is not a fool who does not even spare himself to prevent injury to another, which is an
evil. And this, indeed, reason and the truth itself dictate.1040 For we see that in all animals,

<pb n="342"/>
because they are destitute of wisdom, nature is the provider of supplies for itself. Therefore
they injure others that they may profit themselves, for they do not understand that the1041
committing an injury is evil. But man, who has the knowledge of good and evil, abstains
from committing an injury even to his own damage, which an animal without reason is
unable to do; and on this account innocence is reckoned among the chief virtues of man.
Now by these things it appears that he is the wisest man who prefers to perish rather than
to commit an injury, that he may preserve that sense of duty1042 by which he is distinguished
from the dumb creation. For he who does not point out the error of one who is offering the
gold for sale, in order that he may buy it for a small sum, or he who does not avow that he
is offering for sale a runaway slave or an infected house, having an eye to his own gain or
advantage, is not a wise man, as Carneades wished it to appear, but crafty and cunning. Now
craftiness and cunning exist in the dumb animals also: either when they lie in wait for others,
and take them by deceit, that they may devour them; or when they avoid the snares of others
in various ways. But wisdom falls to man alone. For wisdom is understanding either with
the purpose of doing that which is good and right, or for the abstaining from improper
words and deeds. Now a wise man never gives himself to the pursuit of gain, because he
despises these earthly advantages: nor does he allow any one to be deceived, because it is
the duty of a good man to correct the errors of men, and to bring them back to the right
way; since the nature of man is social and beneficent, in which respect alone he bears a relation
to God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF VIRTUE AND THE TORTURES OF CHRISTIANS, AND OF THE
RIGHT OF A FATHER AND MASTER.</head>
<p>But undoubtedly this is the cause1043 why he appears to be foolish who prefers to be in
want, or to die rather than to inflict injury or take away the property of another,—namely,
because they think that man is destroyed by death. And from this persuasion all the errors
both of the common people and also of the philosophers arise. For if we have no existence
after death, assuredly it is the part of the most foolish man not to promote the interests of
the present life, that it may be long-continued, and may abound with all advantages. But he
who shall act thus must of necessity depart from the rule of justice. But if there remains to
man a longer and a better life—and this we learn both from the arguments of great philosophers,
and from the answers of seers, and the divine words of prophets—it is the part of
the wise man to despise this present life with its advantages, since its entire loss is compensated
by immortality. The same defender of justice, Lælius, says in Cicero:1044 “Virtue
altogether wishes for honour; nor is there any other reward of virtue.” There is indeed another,
and that most worthy of virtue, which you, O Lælius, could never have supposed; for
you had no knowledge of the sacred writings. And this reward it easily receives, and does
not harshly demand. You are greatly mistaken, if you think that a reward can be paid to
virtue by man, since you yourself most truly said in another place: “What riches will you
offer to this man? what commands? what kingdoms? He who regards these things as human,
judges his own advantages to be divine.” Who, therefore, can think you a wise man, O Lælius,
when you contradict yourself, and after a short interval take away from virtue that which
you have given to her? But it is manifest that ignorance of the truth makes your opinion
uncertain and wavering.</p>
<p>In the next place, what do you add? “But if all the ungrateful, or the many who are envious,
or powerful enemies, deprive virtue of its rewards.” Oh how frail, how worthless, have
you represented virtue to be, if it can be deprived of its reward! For if it judges its goods to
be divine, as you said, how can there be any so ungrateful, so envious, so powerful, as to be
able to deprive virtue of those goods which were conferred upon it by the gods? “Assuredly
it delights itself,” he says, “by many comforts, and especially supports itself by its own
beauty.” By what comforts? by what beauty? since that beauty is often charged upon it as a
fault, and turned into a punishment. For what if, as Furius said,1045 a man should be dragged
away, harassed, banished, should be in want, be deprived of his hands, have his eyes put
<note type="footnote">1043 Thus far he has refuted the arguments of Furius, the advocate of injustice. He now shows the reasons
why Lælius, who was esteemed most wise, does not worthily maintain the cause of justice, i.e., because he was
ignorant of heavenly wisdom. [See cap. xvii. p. 152, supra.]</note>

out, be condemned, put into chains, be burned, be miserably tortured also? will virtue lose
its reward, or rather, will it perish itself? By no means. But it will both receive its reward
from God the Judge, and it will live, and always flourish. And if you take away these things,
nothing in the life of man can appear to be so useless, so foolish, as virtue, the natural
goodness and honour of which may teach us that the soul is not mortal, and that a divine
reward is appointed for it by God. But on this account God willed that virtue itself should
be concealed under the character of folly, that the mystery of truth and of His religion might
be secret; that He might show the vanity and error of these superstitions, and of that earthly
wisdom which raises itself too highly, and exhibits great self-complacency, that its difficulty
being at length set forth, that most narrow path might lead to the lofty reward of immortality.</p>
<p>I have shown, as I think, why our people are esteemed foolish by the foolish. For to
choose to be tortured and slain, rather than to take incense in three fingers, and throw it
upon the hearth,1046 appears as foolish as, in a case where life is endangered, to be more
careful of the life of another than of one’s own. For they do not know how great an act of
impiety it is to adore any other object than God, who made heaven and earth, who fashioned
the human race, breathed into them the breath of life, and gave them light. But if he is accounted
the most worthless of slaves who runs away and deserts his master, and if he is
judged most deserving of stripes and chains, and a prison, and the cross, and of all evil; and
if a son, in the same manner, is thought abandoned and impious who deserts his father, that
he may not pay him obedience, and on this account is considered deserving of being disinherited,
and of having his name removed for ever from his family,—how much more so
does he who forsakes God, in whom the two names entitled to equal reverence, of Lord and
Father, alike meet? For what benefit does he who buys a slave bestow upon him, beyond the
nourishment with which he supplies him for his own advantage? And he who begets a son
has it not in his power to effect that he shall be conceived, or born, or live; from which it is
evident that he is not the father, but only the instrument1047 of generation. Of what punishments,
therefore, is he deserving, who forsakes Him who is both the true Master and Father,
but those which God Himself has appointed? who has prepared everlasting fire for the
wicked spirits; and this He Himself threatens by His prophets to the impious and the rebellious.

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE VANITY AND CRIMES, IMPIOUS SUPERSTITIONS, AND OF
THE TORTURES OF THE CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>Therefore, let those who destroy their own souls and the souls of others learn what an
inexpiable crime they commit; in the first place, because they cause their own death by
serving most abandoned demons, whom God has condemned to everlasting punishments;
in the next place, because they do not permit God to be worshipped by others, but endeavour
to turn men aside to deadly rites, and strive with the greatest diligence that no life may be
without injury on earth, which looks to heaven with its condition secured. What else shall
I call them but miserable men, who obey the instigations of their own plunderers,1049 whom
they think to be gods? of whom they neither know the condition, nor origin, nor names,
nor nature; but, clinging to the persuasion of the people, they willingly err, and favour their
own folly. And if you should ask them the grounds of their persuasion, they can assign none,
but have recourse to the judgment of their ancestors, saying that they were wise, that they
approved them, that they knew what was best; and thus they deprive themselves of all power
of perception: they bid adieu to reason, while they place confidence in the errors of others.
Thus, involved in ignorance of all things, they neither know themselves nor their gods. And
would to heaven that they had been willing to err by themselves, and to be unwise by
themselves! But they hurry away others also to be companions of their evil, as though they
were about to derive comfort from the destruction of many. But this very ignorance causes
them to be so cruel in persecuting the wise; and they pretend that they are promoting their
welfare, that they wish to recall them to a good mind.</p>
<p>Do they then strive to effect this by conversation, or by giving some reason? By no
means; but they endeavour to effect it by force and tortures. O wonderful and blind infatuation!
It is thought that there is a bad mind in those who endeavour to preserve their faith,
but a good one in executioners. Is there, then, a bad mind in those who, against every law
of humanity, against every principle of justice, are tortured, or rather, in those who inflict
on the bodies of the innocent such things, as neither the most cruel robbers, nor the most
enraged enemies, nor the most savage barbarians have ever practised? Do they deceive
themselves to such an extent, that they mutually transfer and change the names of good and
evil? Why, therefore, do they not call day night—the sun darkness? Moreover, it is the same
impudence to give to the good the name of evil, to the wise the name of foolish, to the just
the name of impious. Besides this, if they have any confidence in philosophy or in eloquence,
let them arm themselves, and refute these arguments of ours if they are able; let them meet
us hand to hand, and examine every point. It is befitting that they should undertake the
defence of their gods, lest, if our affairs should increase (as they do increase daily), theirs
<note type="footnote">1049 Prædonum. Some refer this to the priests; others, with greater probability, to the demons alluded to in

<pb n="346"/>
should be deserted, together with their shrines and their vain mockeries;1050 and since they
can effect nothing by violence (for the religion of God is increased the more it is oppressed),
let them rather act by the use of reason and exhortations.</p>
<p>Let their priests come forth into the midst, whether the inferior ones or the greatest;
their flamens, augurs, and also sacrificing kings, and the priests and ministers of their superstitions.
Let them call us together to an assembly; let them exhort us to undertake the worship
of their gods; let them persuade us that there are many beings by whose deity and providence
all things are governed; let them show how the origins and beginnings of their sacred rites
and gods were handed down to mortals; let them explain what is their source and principle;
let them set forth what reward there is in their worship, and what punishment awaits neglect;
why they wish to be worshipped by men; what the piety of men contributes to them, if they
are blessed: and let them confirm all these things not by their own assertion (for the authority
of a mortal man is of no weight), but by some divine testimonies, as we do. There is no occasion
for violence and injury, for religion cannot be imposed by force; the matter must be
carried on by words rather than by blows, that the will may be affected. Let them unsheath
the weapon of their intellect; if their system is true, let it be asserted. We are prepared to
hear, if they teach; while they are silent, we certainly pay no credit to them, as we do not
yield to them even in their rage. Let them imitate us in setting forth the system of the whole
matter: for we do not entice, as they say; but we teach, we prove, we show. And thus no one
is detained by us against his will, for he is unserviceable to God who is destitute of faith and
devotedness; and yet no one departs from us, since the truth itself detains him. Let them
teach in this manner, if they have any confidence in the truth; let them speak, let them give
utterance; let them venture, I say, to discuss with us something of this nature; and then assuredly
their error and folly will be ridiculed by the old women, whom they despise, and by
our boys. For, since they are especially clever, they know from books the race of the gods,
and their exploits, and commands, and deaths, and tombs; they may also know that the rites
themselves, in which they have been initiated, had their origin either in human actions, or
in casualties, or in deaths.1051 It is the part of incredible madness to imagine that they are
gods, whom they cannot deny to have been mortal; or if they should be so shameless as to
deny it, their own writings, and those of their own people, will refute them; in short, the
very beginnings of the sacred rites will convict them.1052 They may know, therefore, even
from this very thing, how great a difference there is between truth and falsehood; for they

themselves with all their eloquence are unable to persuade, whereas the unskilled and the
uneducated are able, because the matter itself and the truth speaks.</p>
<p>Why then do they rage, so that while they wish to lessen their folly, they increase it?
Torture1053 and piety are widely different; nor is it possible for truth to be united with violence,
or justice with cruelty. But with good reason they do not venture to teach anything
concerning divine things, lest they should both be derided by our people and be deserted
by their own. For the common people for the most part, if they ascertain that these mysteries
were instituted in memory of the dead, will condemn them, and seek for some truer object
of worship.
<lg>
<l>“Hence rites of mystic awe”1054</l>
</lg>
were instituted by crafty men, that the people may not know what they worship. But since
we are acquainted with their systems, why do they either not believe us who are acquainted
with both, or envy us because we have preferred truth to falsehood? But, they say, the public
rites of religion1055 must be defended. Oh with what an honourable inclination the wretched
men go astray! For they are aware that there is nothing among men more excellent than
religion, and that this ought to be defended with the whole of our power; but as they are
deceived in the matter of religion itself, so also are they in the manner of its defence. For
religion is to be defended, not by putting to death, but by dying; not by cruelty, but by patient
endurance; not by guilt, but by good faith: for the former belong to evils, but the latter to
goods; and it is necessary for that which is good to have place in religion, and not that which
is evil. For if you wish to defend religion by bloodshed, and by tortures, and by guilt, it will
no longer be defended, but will be polluted and profaned. For nothing is so much a matter
of free-will as religion; in which, if the mind of the worshipper is disinclined to it, religion
is at once taken away, and ceases to exist. The right method therefore is, that you defend
religion by patient endurance or by death; in which the preservation of the faith is both
pleasing to God Himself, and adds authority to religion. For if he who in this earthly warfare
preserves his faith to his king in some illustrious action, if he shall continue to live, because
more beloved and acceptable, and if he shall fall, obtains the highest glory, because he has
undergone death for his leader; how much more is faith to be kept towards God, the Ruler
of all, who is able to pay the reward of virtue, not only to the living, but also to the dead!
Therefore the worship of God, since it belongs to heavenly warfare, requires the greatest
devotedness and fidelity. For how will God either love the worshipper, if He Himself is not
loved by him, or grant to the petitioner whatever he shall ask, when he draws nigh to offer

<pb n="348"/>
his prayer without sincerity or reverence? But these men, when they come to offer sacrifice,
present to their gods nothing from within, nothing of their own—no uprightness of mind,
no reverence or fear. Therefore, when the worthless sacrifices are completed, they leave their
religion altogether in the temple, and with the temple, as they had found it; and neither
bring with them anything of it, nor take anything back. Hence it is that religious observances
of this kind are neither able to make men good, nor to be firm and unchangeable. And thus
men are easily led away from them, because nothing is learned in them relating to the life,
nothing relating to wisdom, nothing to faith.1056 For what is the religion of those gods?
what is its power? what its discipline? what its origin? what its principle? what its foundation?
what its substance? what is its tendency? or what does it promise, so that it may be faithfully
preserved and boldly defended by man? I see nothing else in it than a rite pertaining to the
fingers only.1057 But our religion is on this account firm, and solid, and unchangeable, because
it teaches justice, because it is always with us, because it has its existence altogether
in the soul of the worshipper, because it has the mind itself for a sacrifice. In that religion
nothing else is required but the blood of animals, and the smoke of incense, and the senseless
pouring out of libations; but in this of ours, a good mind, a pure breast, an innocent life:
those rites are frequented by unchaste adulteresses without any discrimination, by impudent
procuresses, by filthy harlots; they are frequented by gladiators, robbers, thieves, and sorcerers,
who pray for nothing else but that they may commit crimes with impunity. For what
can the robber ask when he sacrifices, or the gladiator, but that they may slay? what the
poisoner, but that he may escape notice? what the harlot, but that she may sin to the uttermost?
what the adulteress, but either the death of her husband, or that her unchastity may
be concealed? what the procuress, but that she may deprive many of their property? what
the thief, but that he may commit more peculations? But in our religion there is no place
even for a slight and ordinary offence; and if any one shall come to a sacrifice without a
sound conscience, he hears what threats God denounces against him: that God, I say, who
sees the secret places of the heart, who is alway hostile to sins, who requires justice, who
demands fidelity. What place is there here for an evil mind or for an evil prayer? But those
unhappy men neither understand from their own crimes how evil it is to worship, since,
defiled by all crimes, they come to offer prayer; and they imagine that they offer a pious
sacrifice if they wash their skin; as though any streams could wash away, or any seas purify,
the lusts which are shut up within their breast. How much better it is rather to cleanse the
mind, which is defiled by evil desires, and to drive away all vices by the one laver of virtue

<p>But they, because they know not the object or the mode of worship, blindly and unconsciously
fall into the contrary practice. Thus they adore their enemies, they appease with
victims their robbers and murderers, and they place their own souls to be burned with the
very incense on detestable altars. The wretched men are also angry, because others do not
perish in like manner, with incredible blindness of minds. For what can they see who do
not see the sun? As though, if they were gods, they would need the assistance of men against
their despisers. Why, therefore, are they angry with us, if they have no power to effect anything?
Unless it be that they destroy their gods, whose power they distrust, they are more
irreligious than those who do not worship them at all. Cicero, in his Laws,1058 enjoining
men to approach with holiness to the sacrifices, says, “Let them put on piety, let them lay
aside riches; if any one shall act otherwise, God Himself will be the avenger.” This is well
spoken; for it is not right to despair about God, whom you worship on this account, because
you think Him powerful. For how can He avenge the wrongs of His worshippers, if He is
unable to avenge His own? I wish therefore to ask them to whom especially they think that
they are doing a service in compelling them to sacrifice against their will, Is it to those whom
they compel? But that is not a kindness which is done to one who refuses it. But we must
consult their interests, even against their will, since they know not what is good. Why, then,
do they so cruelly harass, torture, and weaken them, if they wish for their safety? or whence
is piety so impious, that they either destroy in this wretched manner, or render useless, those
whose welfare they wish to promote? Or do they do service to the gods? But that is not a
sacrifice which is extorted from a person against his will. For unless it is offered spontaneously,
and from the soul, it is a curse; when men sacrifice, compelled by proscription, by
injuries, by prison, by tortures. If they are gods who are worshipped in this manner, if for
this reason only, they ought not to be worshipped, because they wish to be worshipped in
this manner: they are doubtless worthy of the detestation of men, since libations are made
to them with tears, with groaning, and with blood flowing from all the limbs.</p>
<p>But we, on the contrary, do not require that any one should be compelled, whether he
is willing or unwilling, to worship our God, who is the God of all men; nor are we angry if
any one does not worship Him. For we trust in the majesty of Him who has power to avenge
contempt shown towards Himself, as also He has power to avenge the calamities and injuries
inflicted on His servants. And therefore, when we suffer such impious things, we do not
resist even in word; but we remit vengeance to God, not as they act who would have it appear
that they are defenders of their gods, and rage without restraint against those who do not
worship them. From which it may be understood how it is not good to worship their gods,
<note type="footnote">1058 [Lib ii. cap. 10. A noble reference in this chapter to equality among men.]</note>

<pb n="351"/>
since men ought to have been led to that which is good by good, and not by evil; but because
this is evil, even its office is destitute of good. But they who destroy religious systems must
be punished. Have we destroyed them in a worse manner than the nation of the Egyptians,
who worship the most disgraceful figures of beasts and cattle, and adore as gods some things
which it is even shameful to speak of? Have we done worse than those same who, when they
say that they worship the gods, yet publicly and shamefully deride them?—for they even
allow pantomimic1059 representations of them to be acted with laughter and pleasure. What
kind of a religion is this, or how great must that majesty be considered, which is adored in
temples and mocked in theatres? And they who have done these things do not suffer the
vengeance of the injured deity, but even go away honoured and praised. Do we destroy them
in a worse manner than certain philosophers, who say that there are no gods at all, but that
all things are spontaneously produced, and that all things which are done happen by chance?
Do we destroy them in a worse manner than the Epicureans, who admit the existence of
gods, but deny that they regard anything, and say that they are neither angry nor are influenced
by favour? By which words they plainly persuade men that they are not to be worshipped
at all, inasmuch as they neither regard their worshippers, nor are angry with those
who do not worship them. Moreover, when they argue against fears, they endeavour to effect
nothing else than that no one should fear the gods. And yet these things are willingly heard
by men, and discussed with impunity.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF THE RAGE OF THE DEMONS AGAINST CHRISTIANS, AND THE
ERROR OF UNBELIEVERS.</head>
<p>They do not therefore rage against us on this account, because their gods are not worshipped
by us, but because the truth is on our side, which (as it has been said most truly)
produces hatred. What, then, shall we think, but that they are ignorant of what they suffer?
For they act1060 with a blind and unreasonable fury, which we see, but of which they are
ignorant. For it is not the men themselves who persecute, for they have no cause of anger
against the innocent; but those contaminated and abandoned spirits by whom the truth is
both known and hated insinuate themselves into their minds, and goad them in their ignorance
to fury. For these, as long as there is peace among the people of God, flee from the
righteous, and fear them; and when they seize upon the bodies of men, and harass their
souls, they are adjured by them, and at the name of the true God are put to flight. For when
they hear this name they tremble, cry out, and assert that they are branded and beaten; and
being asked who they are, whence they are come, and how they have insinuated themselves
into a man, confess it. Thus, being tortured and excruciated by the power of the divine name,
they come out of the man.1061 On account of these blows and threats, they always hate holy
and just men; and because they are unable of themselves to injure them, they pursue with
public hatred those whom they perceive to be grievous to them, and they exercise cruelty,
with all the violence which they can employ, that they may either weaken their faith by pain,
or, if they are unable to effect that, may take them away altogether from the earth, that there
may be none to restrain their wickedness. It does not escape my notice what reply can be
made on the other side. Why, then, does that God of surpassing power, that mighty One,
whom you confess to preside over all things, and to be Lord of all, permit these things to be
done, and neither avenge nor defend His worshippers? Why, in short, are they who do not
worship Him rich, and powerful, and happy? and why do they enjoy honours and kingly
state, and have these very persons1062 subject to their power and sway?</p>
<p>We must also give a reason for this, that no error may remain. For this is especially the
cause why it is thought that religion has not the power of God, because men are influenced
by the appearance of earthly and present goods, which in no way have reference to the care
of the mind; and because they see that the righteous are without these goods, and that the
unrighteous abound in them, they both judge that the worship of God is worthless, in which
they do not see these things contained, and they imagine that the rites of other gods are
true, since their worshippers enjoy riches and honours and kingdoms. But they who are of

this opinion do not attentively consider the power and method of man, which consists altogether
in the mind, and not in the body. For they see nothing more than is seen, namely the
body; and because this is to be seen and handled,1063 it is weak, frail, and mortal; and to
this belong all those goods which are their desire and admiration, wealth, honours, and
governments, since they bring pleasures to the body, and therefore are as liable to decay as
the body itself. But the soul, in which alone man consists since it is not exposed to the sight
of the eyes, and its goods cannot be seen, for they are placed in virtue only, must therefore
be as firm, and constant, and lasting as virtue itself, in which the good of the soul consists.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE JUSTICE AND PATIENCE OF THE CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>It would be a lengthened task to draw forth all the appearances of virtue, to show respecting
each how necessary it is for a wise and just man to be far removed from those goods,
the enjoyment of which by the unjust causes the worship of their gods to be regarded as
true and efficacious. As our present inquiry is concerned, it will be sufficient to prove our
point from the case of a single virtue. For instance, patience is a great and leading virtue,
which the public voices of the people and philosophers and orators alike extol with the
highest praises. But if it cannot be denied that this is a virtue of the highest kind, it is necessary
that the just and wise man should be in the power of the unjust, for obtaining patience; for
patience is the bearing with equanimity of the evils which are either inflicted or happen to
fall upon us. Therefore the just and wise man, because he exercises virtue, has patience in
himself; but he will be altogether free from this if he shall suffer no adversity. On the other
hand, the man who lives in prosperity is impatient, and is without the greatest virtue. I call
him impatient, because he suffers nothing. He is also unable to preserve innocency, which
virtue is peculiar to the just and wise man. But he often acts unjustly also, and desires the
property of others, and seizes upon that which he has desired by injustice, because he is
without virtue, and is subject to vice and sin; and forgetful of his frailty, he is puffed up with
a mind elated with insolence.</p>
<p>From this cause the unjust, and those who are ignorant of God, abound with riches,
and power, and honours. For all these things are the rewards of injustice, because they
cannot be perpetual, and they are sought through lust and violence. But the just and wise
man, because he deems all these things as human, as it has been said by Lælius, and his own
goods as divine, neither desires anything which belongs to another, lest he should injure
any one at all in violation of the law of humanity; nor does he long for any power or honour,
that he may not do an injury to any one. For he knows that all are produced by the same
God, and in the same condition, and are joined together by the right of brotherhood.1064
But being contented with his own, and that a little, because he is mindful of his frailty, he
does not seek for anything beyond that which may support his life; and even from that which
he has he bestows a share on the destitute, because he is pious; but piety is a very great virtue.
To this is added, that he despises frail and vicious pleasures, for the sake of which riches are
desired; since he is temperate, and master of his passions. He also, having no pride or insolence,
does not raise himself too highly, nor lift up his head with arrogance; but he is calm
and peaceful, lowly1065 and courteous, because he knows his own condition. Since, therefore,
he does injury to none, nor desires the property of others, and does not even defend his own
if it is taken from him by violence, since he knows how even to bear with moderation an

<note type="footnote">1065 Planus et communis.</note>

<pb n="355"/>
injury inflicted upon him, because he is endued with virtue; it is necessary that the just man
should be subject to the unjust, and that the wise should be insulted by the foolish, that the
one may sin because he is unjust, and the other may have virtue in himself because he is
just.</p>
<p>But if any one shall wish to know more fully why God permits the wicked and the unjust
to become powerful, happy, and rich, and, on the other hand, suffers the pious to be humble,
wretched, and poor, let him take the book of Seneca which has the title, “Why many evils
happen to good men, though there is a providence;” in which book he has said many things,
not assuredly with the ignorance of this world, but wisely, and almost with divine inspiration.
1066 “God,” he says, “regards men as His children, but He permits the corrupt and vicious
to live in luxury and delicacy, because He does not think them worthy of His correction.
But He often chastises the good whom He loves, and by continual labours exercises them
to the practice of virtue: nor does He permit them to be corrupted and depraved by frail
and perishable goods.” From which it ought to appear strange to no one if we are often
chastised by God for our faults. Yea, rather, when we are harassed and pressed, then we especially
give thanks to our most indulgent Father, because He does not permit our corruption
to proceed to greater lengths, but corrects it with stripes and blows. From which we understand
that we are an object of regard to God, since He is angry when we sin. For when He
might have bestowed upon His people both riches and kingdoms, as He had before given
them to the Jews, whose successors and posterity we are; on this account He would have
them live under the power and government of others, lest, being corrupted by the happiness
of prosperity, they should glide into luxury and despise the precepts of God; as those ancestors
of ours, who, ofttimes enervated by these earthly and frail goods, departed from discipline
and burst the bonds of the law. Therefore He foresaw how far He would afford rest to His
worshippers if they should keep His commandments, and yet correct them if they did not
obey His precepts. Therefore, lest they should be as much corrupted by ease as their fathers
had been by indulgence,1067 it was His will that they should be oppressed by those in whose
power He placed them, that He may both confirm them when wavering, and renew them
to fortitude when corrupted, and try and prove them when faithful. For how can a general
prove the valour of his soldiers, unless he shall have an enemy? And yet there arises an adversary
to him against his will, because he is mortal, and is able to be conquered; but because
God cannot be opposed, He Himself stirs up adversaries to His name, not to fight against
God Himself, but against His soldiers, that He may either prove the devotedness and fidelity
<note type="footnote">1066 [“Deus homines pro liberis habet sed corruptos.” He attributes a sort of inspiration to such a writer, as

<note type="footnote">1067 Licentiâ.</note>

<pb n="356"/>
of His servants, or may strengthen them, until He corrects their wasting discipline by the
stripes of affliction.1068</p>
<p>There is also another cause why He permits persecutions to be carried on against us,
that the people of God may be increased.1069 Nor is it difficult to show why or how this
happens. First of all, great numbers are driven from the worship of the false gods by their
hatred of cruelty. For who would not shrink from such sacrifices? In the next place, some
are pleased with virtue and faith itself. Some suspect that it is not without reason that the
worship of the gods is considered evil by so many men, so that they would rather die than
do that which others do that they may preserve their life. Some one desires to know what
that good is which is defended even to death, which is preferred to all things which are
pleasant and beloved in this life, from which neither the loss of goods, nor of the light, nor
bodily pain, nor tortures of the vitals deter them. These things have great effect; but these
causes have always especially increased the number of our followers. The people who stand
around hear them saying in the midst of these very torments that they do not sacrifice to
stones wrought by the hand of man, but to the living God, who is in heaven: many understand
that this is true, and admit it into their breast. In the next place, as it is accustomed to happen
in matters of uncertainty while they make inquiry of one another, what is the cause of this
perseverance, many things which relate to religion, being spread abroad and carefully observed
by rumour among one another, are learned; and because these are good they cannot
fail to please. Moreover, the revenge which follows, as always happens, greatly impels men
to believe. Nor, indeed, is it a slight cause that the unclean spirits of demons, having received
permission, throw themselves into the bodies of many; and when these have afterwards
been driven out, they who have been healed cling to the religion, the power of which they
have experienced. These numerous causes being collected together, wonderfully gain over
a great multitude to God.1070</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIV.—OF THE DIVINE VENGEANCE INFLICTED ON THE TORTURERS

<p>Whatever, therefore, wicked princes plan against us, God Himself permits to be done.
And yet most unjust persecutors, to whom the name of God was a subject of reproach and
mockery, must not think that they will escape with impunity, because they have been, as it
were, the ministers of His indignation against us. For they will be punished with the judgment
of God, who, having received power, have abused it to an inhuman degree, and have even
insulted God in their arrogance, and placed His eternal name beneath their feet, to be impiously
and wickedly trampled upon. On this account He promises that He will quickly take
vengeance upon them, and exterminate the evil monsters1071 from the earth. But He also,
although He is accustomed to avenge the persecutions1072 of His people even in the present
world, commands us, however, to await patiently that day of heavenly judgment, in which
He Himself will honour or punish every man according to his deserts. Therefore let not the
souls of the sacrilegious expect that those whom they thus trample upon will be despised
and unavenged. Those ravenous and voracious wolves who have tormented just and innocent
souls, without the commission of any crimes, will surely meet with their reward. Only let
us labour, that nothing else in us may be punished by men but righteousness alone: let us
strive with all our power that we may at once deserve at the hands of God the avenging of
our suffering and a reward.</p>

<pb n="359"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—OF THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD, AND OF INNOCENCY, AND
OF THE WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS.</head>
<p>We have completed that which was the object of our undertaking, through the teaching
of the Divine Spirit, and the aid of the truth itself; the cause of asserting and explaining
which was imposed upon me both by conscience and faith, and by our Lord Himself, without
whom nothing can be known or clearly set forth. I come now to that which is the chief and
greatest part of this work—to teach in what manner or by what sacrifice God must be worshipped.
For that is the duty of man, and in that one object the sum of all things and the
whole course of a happy life consists, since we were fashioned and received the breath of
life from Him on this account, not that we might behold the heaven and the sun, as
Anaxagoras supposed, but that we might with pure and uncorrupted mind worship Him
who made the sun and the heaven. But although in the preceding books, as far as my moderate
talent permitted, I defended the truth, yet it may especially be elucidated1073 by the
mode of worship itself. For that sacred and surpassing majesty requires from man nothing
more than innocence alone; and if any one has presented this to God, he has sacrificed with
sufficient piety and religion. But men, neglecting justice, though they are polluted by crimes
and outrages of all kinds, think themselves religious if they have stained the temples and
altars with the blood of victims, if they have moistened the hearths with a profusion of fragrant
and old wine. Moreover, they also prepare sacred feasts and choice banquets, as though
they offered to those who would taste something from them. Whatever is rarely to be viewed,
whatever is precious in workmanship or in fragrance, that they judge to be pleasing to their
gods, not by any reference to their divinity, of which they are ignorant, but from their own
desires; nor do they understand that God is in no want of earthly resources.</p>
<p>For they have no knowledge of anything except the earth, and they estimate good and
evil things by the perception and pleasure of the body alone. And as they judge of religion
according to its pleasure, so also they arrange the acts of their whole life. And since they
have turned away once for all from the contemplation of the heaven, and have made that
heavenly faculty the slave of the body, they give the reins to their lusts, as though they were
about to bear away pleasure with themselves, which they hasten to enjoy at every moment;
whereas the soul ought to employ the service of the body, and not the body to make use of
the service of the soul. The same men judge riches to be the greatest good. And if they cannot
obtain them by good practices, they endeavour to obtain them by evil practices; they deceive,
they carry off by violence, they plunder, they lie in wait, they deny on oath; in short, they
have no consideration or regard for anything,1074 if only they can glitter with gold, and
shine conspicuous with plate, with jewels, and with garments, can spend riches upon their

greedy appetite, and always walk attended with crowds of slaves through the people compelled
to give way.1075 Thus devoting1076 themselves to the service of pleasures, they extinguish
the force and vigour of the mind; and when they especially think that they are alive, they
are hastening with the greatest precipitation to death. For, as we showed in the second book,
the soul is concerned with heaven, the body with the earth.1077 They who neglect the goods
of the soul, and seek those of the body, are engaged with darkness and death, which belong
to the earth and to the body, because life and light are from heaven; and they who are without
this, by serving the body, are far removed from the understanding of divine things. The
same blindness everywhere oppresses the wretched men; for as they know not who is the
true God, so they know not what constitutes true worship.</p>

<p>Therefore they sacrifice fine and fat victims to God, as though He were hungry; they
pour forth wine to Him, as though He were thirsty; they kindle lights to Him, as though He
were in darkness.1078 But if they were able to conjecture or to conceive in their mind what
those heavenly goods are, the greatness of which we cannot imagine, while we are still encompassed
with an earthly body, they would at once know that they are most foolish with
their empty offices. Or if they would contemplate that heavenly light which we call the sun,
they will at once perceive how God has no need of their candles, who has Himself given so
clear and bright a light for the use of man.1079 And when, in so small a circle, which on account
of its distance appears to have a measure no greater than that of a human head, there
is still so much brilliancy that mortal eye cannot behold it, and if you should direct your eye
to it for a short time mist and darkness would overspread your dimmed eyes, what light, I
pray, what brightness, must we suppose that there is in God, with whom there is no night?
For He has so attempered this very light, that it might neither injure living creatures by excessive
brightness or vehement heat, and has given it so much of these properties as mortal
bodies might endure or the ripening of the crops require. Is that man, therefore, to be thought
in his senses, who presents the light of candles and torches as an offering to Him who is the
Author and Giver of light? The light which He requires from us is of another kind, and that
indeed not accompanied with smoke, but (as the poet says) clear and bright; I mean the
light of the mind, on account of which we are called by the poets photes,1080 which light no
one can exhibit unless he has known God. But their gods, because they are of the earth,
stand in need of lights, that they may not be in darkness; and their worshippers, because
they have no taste for anything heavenly, are recalled to the earth even by the religious rites
to which they are devoted.1081 For on the earth there is need of a light, because its system
and nature are dark. Therefore they do not attribute to the gods a heavenly perception, but
rather a human one. And on this account they believe that the same things are necessary
and pleasing to them as to us, who, when hungry, have need of food; or, when thirsty, of
drink; or, when we are cold, require a garment; or, when the sun has withdrawn himself,
require a light that we may be able to see.1082</p>

<pb n="362"/>
<p>From nothing, therefore, can it be so plainly proved and understood that those gods,
since they once lived, are dead, as from their worship itself, which is altogether of the earth.
For what heavenly influence can there be in the shedding of the blood of beasts, with which
they stain their altars? unless by chance they imagine that the gods feed upon that which
men shrink from touching. And whoever shall have offered to them this food,1083 although
he be an assassin, an adulterer, a sorcerer, or a parricide, he will he happy and prosperous.
Him they love, him they defend, to him they afford all things which he shall wish for. Persius
therefore deservedly ridicules superstitions of this kind in his own style:1084 “With what
bribe,” he says, “dost thou win the ears of gods? Is it with lungs and rich intestines?” He
plainly perceived that there is no need of flesh for appeasing the majesty of heaven, but of
a pure mind and a just spirit, and a breast, as he himself says, which is generous with a natural
love of honour. This is the religion of heaven—not that which consists of corrupt things,
but of the virtues of the soul, which has its origin from heaven; this is true worship, in which
the mind of the worshipper presents itself as an undefiled offering to God. But how this is
to be obtained, how it is to be afforded, the discussion of this book will show; for nothing
can be so illustrious and so suited to man as to train men to righteousness.1085</p>
<p>In Cicero, Catulus in the Hortensius, while he prefers philosophy to all things, says that
he would rather have one short treatise respecting duty, than a long speech in behalf of a
seditious man Cornelius. And this is plainly to be regarded not as the opinion of Catulus,
who perhaps did not utter this saying, but as that of Cicero, who wrote it. I believe that he
wrote it for the purpose of recommending these books which he was about to write on Offices,
in which very books he testifies that nothing in the whole range of philosophy is better and
more profitable than to give precepts for living. But if this is done by those who do not know
the truth, how much more ought we to do it, who are able to give true precepts,1086 being
taught and enlightened by God? Nor, however, shall we so teach as though we were delivering
the first elements of virtue, which would be an endless task, but as though we had undertaken
the instruction of him who, with them, appears to be already perfect. For while their precepts
remain, which they are accustomed to give correctly, with a view to uprightness, we will
add to them things which were unknown to them, for the completion and consummation
of righteousness, which they do not possess. But I will omit those things which are common
to us with them, that I may not appear to borrow from those whose errors I have determined
to convict and bring to light.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—OF THE WAYS, AND OF VICES AND VIRTUES; AND OF THE REWARDS
OF HEAVEN AND THE PUNISHMENTS OF HELL.</head>
<p>There are two ways,1087 O Emperor Constantine, by which human life must proceed—the
one which leads to heaven, the other which sinks to hell; and these ways poets have introduced
in their poems, and philosophers in their disputations. And indeed philosophers have represented
the one as belonging to virtues, the other to vices; and they have represented that
which belongs to virtues as steep and rugged at the first entrance, in which if any one, having
overcome the difficulty, has climbed to the summit, they say that he afterwards has a level
path, a bright and pleasant plain, and that he enjoys abundant and delightful fruits of his
labours; but that those whom the difficulty of the first approach has deterred, glide and turn
aside into the way of vices, which at its first entrance appears to be pleasant and much more
beaten, but afterwards, when they have advanced in it a little further, that the appearance
of its pleasantness is withdrawn, and that there arises a steep way, now rough with stones,
now overspread with thorns, now interrupted by deep waters or violent with torrents, so
that they must be in difficulty, hesitate, slip about, and fall. And all these things are brought
forward that it may appear that there are very great labours in undertaking virtues, but that
when they are gained there are the greatest advantages, and firm and incorruptible pleasures;
but that vices ensnare the minds of men with certain natural blandishments, and lead them
captivated by the appearance of empty pleasures to bitter griefs and miseries,—an altogether
wise discussion, if they knew the forms and limits of the virtues themselves. For they had
not learned either what they are, or what reward awaits them from God: but this we will
show in these two books.</p>
<p>But these men, because they were ignorant or in doubt that the souls of men are immortal,
estimated both virtues and vices by earthly honours or punishments. Therefore all this
discussion respecting the two ways1088 has reference to frugality and luxury. For they say
that the course of human life resembles the letter Y, because every one of men, when he has
reached the threshold of early youth, and has arrived at the place “where the way divides
itself into two parts,”1089 is in doubt, and hesitates, and does not know to which side he
should rather turn himself. If he shall meet with a guide who may direct him wavering to
better things—that is, if he shall learn philosophy or eloquence, or some honourable arts
by which he may turn to good conduct,1090 which cannot take place without great la-

bour—they say that he will lead a life of honour and abundance; but if he shall not meet
with a teacher of temperance,1091 that he falls into the way on the left hand, which assumes
the appearance of the better,—that is, he gives himself up to idleness, sloth, and luxury,
which seem pleasant for a time to one who is ignorant of true goods, but that afterwards,
having lost all his dignity and property, he will live in all wretchedness and ignominy.
Therefore they referred the end of those ways1092 to the body, and to this life which we lead
on earth. The poets perhaps did better, who would have it that this twofold way was in the
lower regions; but they are deceived in this, that they proposed these ways to the dead. Both
therefore spoke with truth, but yet both incorrectly; for the ways themselves ought to have
been referred to life, their ends to death. We therefore speak better and more truly, who say
that the two ways1093 belong to heaven and hell, because immortality is promised to the
righteous, and everlasting punishment is threatened to the unrighteous.</p>
<p>But I will explain how these ways either exalt to heaven or thrust down to hell, and I
will set forth what these virtues are of which the philosophers were ignorant; then I will
show what are their rewards, and also what are vices, and what their punishments. For
perhaps some one may expect that I shall speak separately of vices and virtues; whereas,
when we discuss the subject of good or evil, that which is contrary may also be understood.
For, whether you introduce virtues, vices will spontaneously depart; or if you take away
vices, virtues will of their own accord succeed. The nature of good and evil things is so fixed,
that they always oppose and drive out one another: and thus it comes to pass that vices
cannot be removed without virtues, nor can virtues be introduced without the removal of
vices. Therefore we bring forward these ways in a very different manner from that in which
the philosophers are accustomed to present them: first of all, because we say that a guide is
proposed to each, and in each case an immortal: but that the one is honoured who presides
over virtues and good qualities, the other condemned who presides over vices and evils. But
they place a guide only on the right side, and that not one only, nor a lasting one; inasmuch
as they introduce any teacher of a good art, who may recall men from sloth, and teach them
to be temperate. But they do not represent any as entering upon that way except boys and
young men; for this reason, that the arts are learned at these ages. We, on the other hand,
lead those of each sex, every age and race, into this heavenly path, because God, who is the
guide of that way, denies immortality to no human being.1094 The shape also of the ways

themselves is not as they supposed. For what need is there of the letter Y in matters which
are different and opposed to one another? But the one which is better is turned towards the
rising of the sun, the other which is worse towards its setting: since he who follows truth
and righteousness, having received the reward of immortality, will enjoy perpetual light;
but he who, enticed by that evil guide, shall prefer vices to virtues, falsehood to truth, must
be borne to the setting of the sun, and to darkness.1095 I will therefore describe each, and
will point out their properties and habits.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—OF THE WAYS OF LIFE, OF PLEASURES, ALSO OF THE HARDSHIPS
OF CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>There is one way, therefore, of virtue and the good, which leads, not, as the poets say,
to the Elysian plains, but to the very citadel of the world:—
<lg>
<l>“The left gives sinners up to pain,</l>
<l>And leads to Tartarus’ guilty reign.”1096</l>
</lg>
For it belongs to that accuser who, having invented false religions, turns men away from
the heavenly path, and leads them into the way of perdition. And the appearance and shape
of this way is so composed to the sight, that it appears to be level and open, and delightful
with all kinds of flowers and fruits. For there are placed1097 in it all things which are esteemed
on earth as good things—I mean wealth, honour, repose, pleasure, all kinds of enticements;
but together with these also injustice, cruelty, pride, perfidy, lust, avarice, discord, ignorance,
falsehood, folly, and other vices. But the end of this way is as follows: When they have
reached the point from which there is now no return, it is so suddenly removed, together
with all its beauty, that no one is able to foresee the fraud before that he falls headlong into
a deep abyss. For whoever is captivated by the appearance of present goods, and occupied
with the pursuit and enjoyment of these, shall not have foreseen the things which are about
to follow after death, and shall have turned aside from God; he truly will be cast down to
hell, and be condemned to eternal punishment.</p>
<p>But that heavenly way is set forth as difficult and hilly, or rough with dreadful thorns,
or entangled with stones jutting out; so that every one must walk with the greatest labour
and wearing of the feet, and with great precautions against falling. In this he has placed
justice, temperance, patience, faith, chastity, self-restraint, concord, knowledge, truth, wisdom,
and the other virtues; but together with these, poverty, ignominy, labour, pain, and
all kinds of hardship. For whoever has extended his hope beyond the present, and chosen
better things, will be without these earthly goods, that, being lightly equipped and without
impediment, he may overcome the difficulty of the way. For it is impossible for him who
has surrounded himself with royal pomp, or loaded himself with riches, either to enter upon
or to persevere in these difficulties. And from this it is understood that it is easier for the
wicked and the unrighteous to succeed in their desires, because their road is downward and
on the decline; but that it is difficult for the good to attain to their wishes, because they walk
along a difficult and steep path. Therefore the righteous man, since he has entered upon a
hard and rugged way, must be an object of contempt, derision, and hatred. For all whom
desire or pleasure drags headlong, envy him who has been able to attain to virtue, and take
<note type="footnote">1096 Virg., Æneid, vi. 542.</note>
<note type="footnote">1097 Posita sunt omnia. There is another reading, “posuit Deus omnia.”</note>

<pb n="367"/>
it ill that any one possesses that which they themselves do not possess. Therefore he will be
poor, humble, ignoble, subject to injury, and yet enduring all things which are grievous;
and if he shall continue his patience unceasingly to that last step and end, the crown of virtue
will be given to him, and he will be rewarded by God with immortality for the labours which
he has endured in life for the sake of righteousness. These are the ways which God has assigned
to human life, in each of which he has shown both good and evil things, but in a
changed and inverted order. In the one he has pointed out in the first place temporal evils
followed by eternal goods, which is the better order; in the other, first temporal goods followed
by eternal evils, which is the worse order: so that, whosoever has chosen present evils
together with righteousness, he will obtain greater and more certain goods than those were
which he despised; but whoever has preferred present goods to righteousness, will fall into
greater and more lasting evils than those were which he avoided. For as this bodily life is
short, therefore its goods and evils must also be short; but since that spiritual life, which is
contrary to this earthly life, is everlasting, therefore its goods and evils are also everlasting.
Thus it comes to pass, that goods of short duration are succeeded by eternal evils, and evils
of short duration by eternal goods.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, good and evil things are set before man at the same time, it is befitting
that every one should consider with himself how much better it is to compensate evils of
short duration by perpetual goods, than to endure perpetual evils for short and perishable
goods. For as, in this life, when a contest with an enemy is set before you, you must first labour
that you may afterwards enjoy repose, you must suffer hunger and thirst, you must
endure heat and cold, you must rest on the ground, must watch and undergo dangers, that
your children,1098 and house, and property being preserved, you may be able to enjoy all
the blessings of peace and victory; but if you should choose present ease in preference to
labour, you must do yourself the greatest injury: for the enemy will surprise you offering
no resistance, your lands will be laid waste, your house plundered, your wife and children
become a prey, you yourself will be slain or taken prisoner; to prevent the occurrence of
these things, present advantage must be put aside, that a greater and more lasting advantage
may be gained;—so in the whole of this life, because God has provided an adversary for us,
that we might be able to acquire virtue, present gratification must be laid aside, lest the enemy
should overpower us. We must be on the watch, must post guards, must undertake military
expeditions, must shed our blood to the uttermost; in short, we must patiently submit to all
things which are unpleasant and grievous, and the more readily because God our commander
has appointed for us eternal rewards for our labours. And since in this earthly warfare men
expend so much labour to acquire for themselves those things which may perish in the same
<note type="footnote">1098 Pignoribus.</note>

<pb n="368"/>
manner as that in which they were acquired, assuredly no labour ought to be refused by us,
by whom that is gained which can in no way be lost.</p>
<p>For God, who created men to this warfare, desired that they should stand prepared in
battle array, and with minds keenly intent should watch against the stratagems or open attacks
of our single enemy, who, as is the practice of skilful and experienced generals, endeavours
to ensnare us by various arts, directing his rage according to the nature and disposition of
each. For he infuses into some insatiable avarice, that, being chained by their riches as by
fetters, he may drive them from the way of truth. He inflames others with the excitement
of anger, that while they are rather intent upon inflicting injury, he may turn them aside
from the contemplation of God. He plunges others into immoderate lusts, that, giving
themselves to pleasure of the body, they may be unable to look towards virtue. He inspires
others with envy, that, being occupied with their own torments, they may think of nothing
but the happiness of those whom they hate. He causes others to swell with ambitious desires.
These are they who direct the whole occupation and care of their life to the holding of magistracies,
that they may set a mark upon the annals,1099 and give a name to the years. The
desire of others mounts higher, not that they may rule provinces with the temporal sword,
but with boundless and perpetual power may wish to be called lords of the whole human
race.1100 Moreover, those whom he has seen to be pious he involves in various1101 superstitions,
that he may make them impious. But to those who seek for wisdom, he dashes
philosophy before their eyes,1102 that he may blind them with the appearance of light, lest
any one should grasp and hold fast the truth. Thus he has blocked up all the approaches
against men, and has occupied the way, rejoicing in public errors; but that we might be able
to dispel these errors, and to overcome the author of evils himself, God has enlightened us,
and has armed us with true and heavenly virtue, respecting which I must now speak.</p>
<note type="footnote">1099 It was customary in many of the ancient states to connect the year with the name of the chief magistrate
who was then in office. Thus at Athens the title of the chief magistrate was Archon Eponymus, giving name to

<head>CHAP. V.—OF FALSE AND TRUE VIRTUE; AND OF KNOWLEDGE.</head>
<p>But before I begin to set forth the separate virtues, I must mark out the character of
virtue itself, which the philosophers have not rightly defined, as to its nature, or in what
things it consisted; and I must describe its operation and office. For they only retained the
name, but lost its power, and nature, and effect. But whatever they are accustomed to say
in their definition of virtue, Lucilius puts together and expresses in a few verses, which I
prefer to introduce, lest, while I refute the opinions of many, I should be longer than is necessary:—
<lg>
<l>“It is virtue, O Albinus, to pay the proper price,</l>
<l>To attend to the matters in which we are engaged, and in which we live.</l>
<l>It is virtue for a man to know the nature of everything.</l>
<l>It is virtue for a man to know what is right and useful and honourable,</l>
<l>What things are good, and what are evil.</l>
<l>What is useless,1103 base, and dishonourable.</l>
<l>It is virtue to know the end of an object to be sought and the means of procuring it</l>
<l>It is virtue to be able to assign their value to riches.</l>
<l>It is virtue to give that which is really due to honour;</l>
<l>To be the enemy and the foe1104 of bad men and manners, but, on the other
hand, the defender of good men and manners;</l>
<l>To esteem these highly, to wish them well, to live in friendship with them,</l>
<l>Moreover, to consider the interest of one’s country first;</l>
<l>Then those of parents, to put our own interests in the third and last place.”</l>
</lg>
From these definitions, which the poet briefly puts together, Marcus Tullius derived the
offices of living, following Panætius the Stoic,1105 and included them in three books.</p>
<p>But we shall presently see how false these things are, that it may appear how much the
divine condescension has bestowed on us in opening to us the truth. He says that it is virtue
to know what is good and evil, what is base, what is honourable, what is useful, what is
useless. He might have shortened his treatise if he had only spoken of that which is good
and evil; for nothing can be useful or honourable which is not also good, and nothing useless
and base which is not also evil. And this also appears to be thus to philosophers, and Cicero
shows it likewise in the third book of the above-mentioned treatise.1106 But knowledge

<pb n="370"/>
cannot be virtue, because it is not within us, but it comes to us from without. But that which
is able to pass from one to the other is not virtue, because virtue is the property of each individual.
Knowledge therefore consists in a benefit derived from another; for it depends
upon hearing. Virtue is altogether our own; for it depends upon the will of doing that which
is good. As, therefore, in undertaking a journey, it is of no profit to know the way, unless
we also have the effort and strength for walking, so truly knowledge is of no avail if our
virtue fails. For, in general, even they who sin perceive what is good and evil, though not
perfectly; and as often as they act improperly, they know that they sin, and therefore endeavour
to conceal their actions. But though the nature of good and evil does not escape their
notice, they are overpowered by an evil desire to sin, because they are wanting in virtue,
that is, the desire of doing right and honourable things. Therefore that the knowledge of
good and evil is one thing, and virtue another, appears from this, because knowledge can
exist without virtue, as it has been in the case of many of the philosophers; in which, since
not to have done what you knew to be right is justly censurable, a depraved will and a vicious
mind, which ignorance cannot excuse, will be justly punished. Therefore, as the knowledge
of good and evil is not virtue, so the doing that which is good and the abstaining from evil
is virtue. And yet knowledge is so united with virtue, that knowledge precedes virtue, and
virtue follows knowledge; because knowledge is of no avail unless it is followed up by action.
Horace therefore speaks somewhat better: “Virtue is the fleeing from vice, and the first
wisdom is to be free from folly.”1107 But he speaks improperly, because he defined virtue
by its contrary, as though he should say, That is good which is not evil. For when I know
not what virtue is, I do not know what vice is. Each therefore requires definition, because
the nature of the case is such that each must be understood or not understood.1108</p>
<p>But let us do that which he ought to have done. It is a virtue to restrain anger, to control
desire, to curb lust; for this is to flee from vice. For almost all things which are done unjustly
and dishonestly arise from these affections. For if the force of this emotion which is called
anger be blunted, all the evil contentions of men will be lulled to rest; no one will plot, no
one will rush forth to injure another. Also, if desire be restrained, no one will use violence
by land or by sea, no one will lead an army to carry off and lay waste the property of others.
Also, if the ardour of lusts be repressed, every age and sex will retain its sanctity; no one will
suffer, or do anything disgraceful. Therefore all crimes and disgraceful actions will be taken
away from the life and character of men, if these emotions are appeased and calmed by virtue.
And this calming of the emotions and affections has this meaning, that we do all things
which are right. The whole duty of virtue then is, not to sin. And assuredly he cannot dis-

charge this who is ignorant of God, since ignorance of Him from whom good things proceed
must thrust a man unawares into vices. Therefore, that I may more briefly and significantly
fix the offices of each subject, knowledge is to know God, virtue is to worship Him: the
former implies wisdom, the latter righteousness.</p>

<pb n="372"/>
<head>CHAP. VI.—OF THE CHIEF GOOD AND VIRTUE, AND OR KNOWLEDGE AND
RIGHTEOUSNESS.</head>
<p>I have said that which was the first thing, that the knowledge of good is not virtue; and
secondly, I have shown what virtue is, and in what it consists. It follows that I should show
this also, that the philosophers were ignorant of what is good and evil; and this briefly, because
it has been almost1109 made plain in the third book, when I was discussing the subject of
the chief good. And because they did not know what the chief good was, they necessarily
erred in the case of the other goods and evils which are not the chief; for no one can weigh
these with a true judgment who does not possess the fountain itself from which they are
derived. Now the source of good things is God; but of evils, he who is always the enemy of
the divine name, of whom we have often spoken. From these two sources good and evil
things have their origin. Those which proceed from God have this object, to procure immortality,
which is the greatest good; but those which arise from the other have this office, to
call man away from heavenly things and sink him in earthly things, and thus to consign him
to the punishment of everlasting death, which is the greatest evil. Is it therefore doubtful
but that all those were ignorant of what was good and evil, who neither knew God nor the
adversary of God? Therefore they referred the end of good things to the body, and to this
short life, which must be dissolved and perish: they did not advance further. But all their
precepts, and all the things which they introduce as goods, adhere to the earth, and lie on
the ground, since they die with the body, which is earth; for they do not tend to procure life
for man, but either to the acquisition or increase of riches, honour, glory, and power, which
are altogether mortal things, as much so indeed as he who has laboured to obtain them.
Hence is that saying,1110 “It is virtue to know the end of an object1111 to be sought, and the
means of procuring it;” for they enjoin by what means and by what practices property is to
be sought, for they see that it is often sought unjustly. But virtue of this kind is not proposed
to the wise man; for it is not virtue to seek riches, of which neither the finding nor the possession
is in our power: therefore they are more easy to be gained and to be retained by the
bad than by the good. Virtue, then, cannot consist in the seeking of those things in the despising
of which the force and purport of virtue appears; nor will it have recourse to those
very things which, with its great and lofty mind, it desires to trample upon and bruise under
foot; nor is it lawful for a soul which is earnestly fixed on heavenly goods to be called away
from its immortal pursuits, that it may acquire for itself these frail things. But the course1112

<note type="footnote">1111 See chap. v. [p. 167, supra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1112 Ratio virtutis.</note>

<pb n="373"/>
of virtue especially consists in the acquisition of those things which neither any man, nor
death itself, can take away from us. Since these things are so, that which follows is true: “It
is virtue to be able to assign their value to riches:” which verse is nearly of the same meaning
as the first two. But neither he nor any of the philosophers was able to know the price itself,
either of what nature or what it is; for the poet, and all those whom he followed, thought
that it meant to make a right use of riches,—that is, to be moderate in living, not to make
costly entertainments, not to squander carelessly, not to expend property on superfluous
or disgraceful objects.1113</p>
<p>Some one will perhaps say, What do you say? Do you deny that this is virtue? I do not
deny it indeed; for if I should deny it, I should appear to prove the opposite. But I deny that
it is true virtue; because it is not that heavenly principle, but is altogether of the earth, since
it produces no effect but that which remains on the earth.1114 But what it is to make a right
use of wealth, and what advantage is to be sought from riches, I will declare more openly
when I shall begin to speak of the duty of piety. Now the other things which follow are by
no means true; for to proclaim enmity against the wicked, or to undertake the defence of
the good, may be common to it with the evil. For some, by a pretence of goodness, prepare
the way for themselves to power, and do many things which the good are accustomed to
do, and that the more readily because they do them for the sake of deceiving; and I wish
that it were as easy to carry out goodness in action as it is to pretend to it. But when they
have begun to attain to their purpose and their wish in reaching the highest step of power,
then, truly laying aside pretence, these men discover their character; they seize upon
everything, and offer violence, and lay waste; and they press upon the good themselves,
whose cause they had undertaken; and they cut away the steps by which they mounted, that
no one may be able to imitate them against themselves. But, however, let us suppose that
this duty of defending the good belongs only to the good man. Yet to undertake it is easy,
to fulfil it is difficult; because when you have committed yourself to a contest and an encounter,
the victory is placed at the disposal of God, not in your own power. And for the
most part the wicked are more powerful both in number and in combination than the good,
so that it is not so much virtue which is necessary to overcome them as good fortune. Is any
one ignorant how often the better and the juster side has been overcome? From this cause
harsh tyrannies have always broken out against the citizens. All history is full of examples,
but we will be content with one. Cnoeus Pompeius wished to be the defender of the good,
since he took up arms in defence of the commonwealth, in defence of the senate, and in
<note type="footnote">1113 [How I love our author for his winning reproof of mere philosophical virtue in contrast with evangelical

<note type="footnote">1114 [See the Quis Dives Salvetur of Clement, vol. ii. p. 591, this series.]</note>

<pb n="374"/>
defence of liberty; and yet the same man, being conquered, perished together with liberty
itself,1115 and being mutilated by Egyptian eunuchs, was cast forth unburied.1116</p>
<p>It is not virtue, therefore, either to be the enemy of the bad or the defender of the good,
because virtue cannot be subject to uncertain chances.
<lg>
<l>“Moreover, to reckon the interests of our country as in the first place.”</l>
</lg>
When the agreement of men is taken away, virtue has no existence at all; for what are the
interests of our country, but the inconveniences of another state or nation?—that is, to extend
the boundaries which are violently taken from others, to increase the power of the state, to
improve the revenues,—all which things are not virtues, but the overthrowing of virtues:
for, in the first place, the union of human society is taken away, innocence is taken away,
the abstaining from the property of another is taken away; lastly, justice itself is taken away,
which is unable to bear the tearing asunder of the human race, and wherever arms have
glittered, must be banished and exterminated from thence. This saying of Cicero1117 is true:
“But they who say that regard is to be had to citizens, but that it is not to be had to foreigners,
these destroy the common society of the human race; and when this is removed, beneficence,
liberality, kindness, and justice are entirely1118 taken away.” For how can a man be just who
injures, who hates, who despoils, who puts to death? And they who strive to be serviceable
to their country do all these things: for they are ignorant of what this being serviceable is,
who think nothing useful, nothing advantageous, but that which can be held by the hand;
and this alone cannot be held, because it may be snatched away.</p>
<p>Whoever, then, has gained for his country these goods—as they themselves call
them—that is, who by the overthrow of cities and the destruction of nations has filled the
treasury with money, has taken lands and enriched his country-men—he is extolled with
praises to the heaven: in him there is said to be the greatest and perfect virtue. And this is
the error not only of the people and the ignorant, but also of philosophers, who even give
precepts for injustice, lest folly and wickedness should be wanting in discipline and authority.
Therefore, when they are speaking of the duties relating to warfare, all that discourse is accommodated
neither to justice nor to true virtue, but to this life and to civil institutions;1119
<note type="footnote">1115 [Haggai. ii. 7. “La journée de Pharsale fut la dernière heure de la liberté. Le sénat, les lois, le peuple, les

<pb n="375"/>
and that this is not justice the matter itself declares, and Cicero has testified.1120 “But we,”
he says, “are not in possession of the real and life-like figure of true law and genuine justice,
we have nothing but delineations and sketches;1121 and I wish that we followed even these,
for they are taken from the excellent copies made by nature and truth.” It is then a delineation
and a sketch which they thought to be justice. But what of wisdom? does not the same man
confess that it has no existence in philosophers? “Nor,” he says,1122 “when Fabricius or
Aristides is called just, is an example of justice sought from these as from a wise man; for
none of these is wise in the sense in which we wish the truly wise to be understood. Nor
were they who are esteemed and called wise, Marcus Cato and Caius Lælius, actually wise,
nor those well-known seven;1123 but from their constant practice of the ‘middle duties,’1124
they bore a certain likeness and appearance1125 of wise men.” If therefore wisdom is taken
away from the philosophers by their own confession, and justice is taken away from those
who are regarded as just, it follows that all those descriptions of virtue must be false, because
no one can know what true virtue is but he who is just and wise. But no one is just and wise
but he whom God has instructed with heavenly precepts.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF THE WAY OF ERROR AND OF TRUTH: THAT IT IS SINGLE,
NARROW, AND STEEP, AND HAS GOD FOR ITS GUIDE.</head>
<p>For all those who, by the confessed folly of others, are thought wise, being clothed with
the appearance of virtue, grasp at shadows and outlines, but at nothing true. Which happens
on this account, because that deceitful road which inclines to the west has many paths, on
account of the variety of pursuits and systems which are dissimilar and varied in the life of
men. For as that way of wisdom contains something which resembles folly, as we showed
in the preceding book, so this way, which belongs altogether to folly, contains something
which resembles wisdom, and they who perceive the folly of men in general seize upon this;
and as it has its vices manifest, so it has something which appears to resemble virtue: as it
has its wickedness open, so it has a likeness and appearance of justice. For how could the
forerunner1126 of that way, whose strength and power are altogether in deceit, lead men
altogether into fraud, unless he showed them some things which resembled the truth?1127
For, that His immortal secret might be hidden, God placed in his way things which men
might despise as evil and disgraceful, that, turning away from wisdom and truth, which they
were searching for without any guide, they might fall upon that very thing which they desired
to avoid and flee from. Therefore he points out that way of destruction and death which
has many windings, either because there are many kinds of life, or because there are many
gods who are worshipped.</p>
<p>The deceitful1128 and treacherous guide of this way, that there may appear to be some
distinction between truth and falsehood, good and evil, leads the luxurious in one direction,
and those who are called temperate1129 in another; the ignorant in one direction, the learned
in another; the sluggish in one direction, the active in another; the foolish in one direction,
the philosophers in another, and even these not in one path. For those who do not shun
pleasures or riches, he withdraws a little from this public and frequented road; but those
who either wish to follow virtue, or profess a contempt for things, he drags over certain
rugged precipices. But nevertheless all those paths which display an appearance of honours
are not different roads, but turnings off1130 and bypaths, which appear indeed to be separated
from that common one, and to branch off to the right, but yet return to the same, and all
lead at the very end to one issue. For that guide unites them all, where it was necessary that
the good should be separated from the bad, the strong from the inactive, the wise from the
foolish; namely, in the worship of the gods, in which he slays them all with one sword, because

they were all foolish without any distinction, and plunges them into death. But this
way—which is that of truth, and wisdom, and virtue, and justice, of all which there is but
one fountain, one source of strength, one abode—is both simple,1131 because with like
minds, and with the utmost agreement, we follow and worship one God; and it is narrow,
because virtue is given to the smaller number; and steep, because goodness, which is very
high and lofty, cannot be attained to without the greatest difficulty and labour.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE ERRORS OF PHILOSOPHERS, AND THE VARIABLENESS
OF LAW.</head>
<p>This is the way which philosophers seek, but do not find on this account, because they
prefer to seek it on the earth, where it cannot appear. Therefore they wander, as it were, on
the great sea, and do not understand whither they are borne, because they neither discern
the way nor follow any guide. For this way of life ought to be sought in the same manner in
which their course is sought by ships over the deep: for unless they observe some light of
heaven, they wander with uncertain courses. But whoever strives to hold the right course
of life ought not to look to the earth, but to the heaven: and, to speak more plainly, he ought
not to follow man, but God; not to serve these earthly images, but the heavenly God; not to
measure all things by their reference to the body, but by their reference to the soul; not to
attend to this life, but the eternal life. Therefore, if you always direct your eyes towards
heaven, and observe the sun, where it rises, and take this as the guide of your life, as in the
case of a voyage, your feet will spontaneously be directed into the way; and that heavenly
light, which is a much brighter sun1132 to sound minds than this which we behold in mortal
flesh, will so rule and govern you as to lead you without any error to the most excellent
harbour of wisdom and virtue.</p>
<p>Therefore the law of God must be undertaken, which may direct us to this path; that
sacred, that heavenly law, which Marcus Tullius, in his third book respecting the Republic,1133
has described almost with a divine voice; whose words have subjoined, that I might not
speak at greater length: “There is indeed a true law, right reason, agreeing with nature, diffused
among all, unchanging, everlasting, which calls to duty by commanding, deters from
wrong by forbidding; which, however, neither commands nor forbids the good in vain, nor
affects the wicked by commanding or forbidding. It is not allowable to alter1134 the provisions
of this law, nor is it permitted us to modify it, nor can it be entirely abrogated.1135 Nor,
truly, can we be released from this law, either by the senate or by the people; nor is another
person to be sought to explain or interpret it. Nor will there be one law at Rome and another
at Athens; one law at the present time, and another hereafter: but the same law, everlasting
and unchangeable, will bind all nations at all times; and there will be one common Master
and Ruler of all, even God, the framer, arbitrator, and proposer of this law; and he who shall
not obey this will flee from himself, and, despising the nature of man, will suffer the greatest

punishments through this very thing, even though he shall have escaped the other punishments
which are supposed to exist.” Who that is acquainted with the mystery of God could
so significantly relate the law of God, as a man far removed from the knowledge of the truth
has set forth that law? But I consider that they who speak true things unconsciously are to
be so regarded as though they prophesied1136 under the influence of some spirit. But if he
had known or explained this also, in what precepts the law itself consisted, as he clearly saw
the force and purport of the divine law, he would not have discharged the office of a philosopher,
but of a prophet. And because he was unable to do this, it must be done by us, to
whom the law itself has been delivered by the one great Master and Ruler of all, God.</p>

<pb n="380"/>
<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE LAW AND PRECEPT OF GOD; OF MERCY, AND THE ERROR
OF THE PHILOSOPHERS.</head>
<p>The first head of this law is, to know God Himself, to obey Him alone, to worship Him
alone. For he cannot maintain the character of a man who is ignorant of God, the parent of
his soul: which is the greatest impiety. For this ignorance causes him to serve other gods,
and no greater crime than this can be committed. Hence there is now so easy a step to
wickedness through ignorance of the truth and of the chief good; since God, from the
knowledge of whom he shrinks, is Himself the fountain of goodness. Or if he shall wish to
follow the justice of God, yet, being ignorant of the divine law, he embraces the laws of his
own country as true justice, though they were clearly devised not by justice, but by utility.
For why is it that there are different and various laws amongst all people, but that each nation
has enacted for itself that which it deemed useful for its own affairs? But how greatly utility
differs from justice the Roman people themselves teach, who, by proclaiming war through
the Fecials, and by inflicting injuries according to legal forms, by always desiring and carrying
off the property of other, have gained for themselves the possession of the whole world.1137
But these persons think themselves just if they do nothing against their own laws; which
may be even ascribed to fear, if they abstain from crimes through dread of present punishment.</p>
<p>But let us grant that they do that naturally, or, as the philosopher says, of their own
accord, which they are compelled to do by the laws. Will they therefore be just, because they
obey the institutions of men, who may themselves have erred, or have been unjust?—as it
was with the framers of the twelve tables, who certainly promoted the public advantage according
to the condition of the times. Civil law is one thing, which varies everywhere according
to customs; but justice is another thing, which God has set forth to all as uniform and
simple: and he who is ignorant of God must also be ignorant of justice.
But let us suppose it possible that any one, by natural and innate goodness, should gain
true virtues, such a man as we have heard that Cimon was at Athens, who both gave alms
to the needy, and entertained the poor, and clothed the naked; yet, when that one thing
which is of the greatest importance is wanting—the acknowledgment of God—then all those
good things are superfluous and empty, so that in pursuing them he has laboured in vain.1138
For all his justice will resemble a human body which has no head, in which, although all the
limbs are in their proper position, and figure, and proportion, yet, since that is wanting
which is the chief thing of all, it is destitute both of life and of all sensation. Therefore those
limbs have only the shape of limbs, but admit of no use, as much so as a head without a
body; and he resembles this who is not without the knowledge of God, but yet lives unjustly.
<note type="footnote">1137 [Dan vii. 23. An appeal for reformation.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1138 [1 Cor. iii. 11–15. But are the heathen to be judged by the New Covenant? See vol. ii. (Clement, sparsim),
this series.]</note>

<pb n="381"/>
For he has that only which is of the greatest importance; but he has it to no purpose, since
he is destitute of the virtues, as it were, of limbs.</p>
<p>Therefore, that the body may be alive, and capable of sensation, both the knowledge of
God is necessary, as it were the head, and all the virtues, as it were the body. Thus there will
exist a perfect and living man; but, however, the whole substance is in the head; and although
this cannot exist in the absence of all, it may exist in the absence of some. And it will be an
imperfect and faulty animal, but yet it will be alive, as he who knows God and yet sins in
some respect. For God pardons sins. And thus it is possible to live without some of the limbs,
but it is by no means possible to live without a head. This is the reason why the philosophers,
though they may be naturally good, yet have no knowledge and no intelligence. All their
learning and virtue is without a head, because they are ignorant of God, who is the Head of
virtue and knowledge; and he who is ignorant of Him, though he may see, is blind; though
he may hear, is deaf; though he may speak, is dumb. But when he shall know the Creator
and Parent of all things, then he will both see, and hear, and speak. For he begins to have a
head, in which all the senses are placed, that is, the eyes, and ears, and tongue. For assuredly
he sees who has beheld with the eyes of his mind the truth in which God is, or God in whom
the truth is; he hears, who imprints on his heart the divine words and life-giving precepts;
he speaks, who, in discussing heavenly things, relates the virtue and majesty of the surpassing
God. Therefore he is undoubtedly impious who does not acknowledge God; and all his virtues,
which he thinks that he has or possesses, are found in that deadly road which belongs
altogether to darkness. Wherefore there is no reason why any one should congratulate
himself if he has gained these empty virtues, because he is not only wretched who is destitute
of present goods, but he must also be foolish, since he undertakes the greatest labours in his
life without any purpose. For if the hope of immortality is taken away, which God promises
to those who continue in His religion, for the sake of obtaining which virtue is to be sought,
and whatever evils happen are to be endured, it will assuredly be the greatest folly to wish
to comply with virtues which in vain bring calamities and labours to man. For if it is virtue
to endure and undergo with fortitude, want, exile, pain, and death, which are feared by
others, what goodness, I pray, has it in itself, that philosophers should say that it is to be
sought for on its own account? Truly they are delighted with superfluous and useless punishments,
when it is permitted them to live in tranquillity.</p>
<p>For if our souls are mortal, if virtue is about to have no existence after the dissolution
of the body, why do we avoid the goods assigned to us, as though we were ungrateful or
unworthy of enjoying the divine gifts? For, that we may enjoy these blessings, we must live
in wickedness and impiety, because virtue, that is, justice, is followed by poverty. Therefore
he is not of sound mind, who, without having any greater hope set before him, prefers labours,
and tortures, and miseries, to those goods which others enjoy in life.1139 But if virtue is to
<note type="footnote">1139 [1 Cor. xv. 19.]</note>

<pb n="382"/>
be taken up, as is most rightly said by these, because it is evident that man is born to it, it
ought to contain some greater hope, which may apply a great and illustrious solace for the
ills and labours which it is the part of virtue to endure. Nor can virtue, since it is difficult in
itself, be esteemed as a good in any other way than by having its hardship compensated by
the greatest good. We can in no other way equally abstain from these present goods, than
if there are other greater goods on account of which it is worth while to leave the pursuit of
pleasures, and to endure all evils. But these are no other, as I have shown in the third
book,1140 than the goods of everlasting life. Now who can bestow these except God, who
has proposed to us virtue itself? Therefore the sum and substance of everything is contained
in the acknowledging and worship of God; all the hope and safety of man centres in this;
this is the first step of wisdom, to know who is our true Father, and to worship Him alone
with the piety which is due to Him, to obey Him, to yield ourselves to His service with the
utmost devotedness: let our entire acting, and care, and attention, be laid out in gaining His
favour.1141</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF RELIGION TOWARDS GOD, AND MERCY TOWARDS MEN; AND
OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.</head>
<p>I have said what is due to God, I will now say what is to be given to man; although this
very thing which you shall give to man is given to God, for man is the image of God. But,
however, the first office of justice is to be united with God, the second with man. But the
former is called religion; the second is named mercy or kindness;1142 which virtue is peculiar
to the just, and to the worshippers of God, because this alone comprises the principle
of common life. For God, who has not given wisdom to the other animals, has made them
more safe from attack in danger by natural defences. But because He made him naked and
defenceless,1143 that He might rather furnish him with wisdom, He gave him, besides other
things, this feeling of kindness;1144 so that man should protect, love, and cherish man, and
both receive and afford assistance against all dangers. Therefore kindness is the greatest
bond of human society; and he who has broken this is to be deemed impious, and a parricide.
For if we all derive our origin from one man, whom God created, we are plainly of one
blood; and therefore it must be considered the greatest wickedness to hate a man, even
though guilty. On which account God has enjoined that enmities are never to be contracted
by us, but that they are always to be removed, so that we soothe those who are our enemies,
by reminding them of their relationship. Likewise, if we are all inspired and animated by
one God, what else are we than brothers? And, indeed, the more closely united, because we
are united in soul rather than in body.1145 Accordingly Lucretius does not err when he
says:1146 “In short, we are all sprung from a heavenly seed; all have that same father.”
Therefore they are to be accounted as savage beasts who injure man; who, in opposition to
every law and right of human nature, plunder, torture, slay, and banish.</p>
<p>On account of this relationship of brotherhood, God teaches us never to do evil, but
always good. And He also prescribes1147 in what this doing good consists: in affording aid
to those who are oppressed and in difficulty, and in bestowing food on those who are destitute.
For God, since He is kind,1148 wished us to be a social animal. Therefore, in the case

of other men, we ought to think of ourselves. We do not deserve to be set free in our own
dangers, if we do not succour others; we do not deserve assistance, if we refuse to render it.
There are no precepts of philosophers to this purport, inasmuch as they, being captivated
by the appearance of false virtue, have taken away mercy from man, and while they wish to
heal, have corrupted.1149 And though they generally admit that the mutual participation of
human society is to be retained, they entirely separate themselves from it by the harshness
of their inhuman virtue. This error, therefore, is also to be refuted, of those who think that
nothing is to be bestowed on any one. They have introduced not one origin only, and cause
of building a city; but some relate that those men who were first born from the earth, when
they passed a wandering life among the woods and plains, and were not united by any mutual
bond of speech or justice, but had leaves and grass for their beds, and caves and grottos
for their dwellings, were a prey to the beasts and stronger animals. Then, that those who
had either escaped, having been torn, or had seen their neighbours torn, being admonished
of their own danger, had recourse to other men, implored protection, and at first made their
wishes known by nods; then that they tried the beginnings of conversation, and by attaching
names to each object, by degrees completed the system of speech. But when they saw that
numbers themselves were not safe against the beasts, they began also to build towns, either
that they might make their nightly repose safe, or that they might ward off the incursions
and attacks of beasts, not by fighting, but by interposing barriers.1150</p>
<p>O minds unworthy of men, which produced these foolish trifles! O wretched and pitiable
men, who committed to writing and handed down to memory the record of their own folly;
who, when they saw that the plan of assembling themselves together, or of mutual intercourse,
or of avoiding danger, or of guarding against evil, or of preparing for themselves sleepingplaces
and lairs, was natural even to the dumb animals, thought, however, that men could
not have been admonished and learned, except by examples, what they ought to fear, what
to avoid, and what to do, or that they would never have assembled together, or have discovered
the method of speech, had not the beasts devoured them! These things appeared
to others senseless, as they really were; and they said that the cause of their coming together
was not the tearing of wild beasts, but rather the very feeling of humanity itself; and that
therefore they collected themselves together, because the nature of men avoided solitude,
and was desirous of communion and society. The discrepancy between them is not great;
since the causes are different, the fact is the same. Each might have been true, because there
is no direct opposition. But, however, neither is by any means true, because men were not
born from the ground throughout the world, as though sprung from the teeth of some

dragon, as the poets relate; but one man was formed by God, and from that one man all the
earth was filled with the human race, in the same way as again took place after the deluge,
which they certainly cannot deny.1151 Therefore no assembling together of this kind took
place at the beginning; and that there were never men on the earth who could not speak
except those who were infants,1152 every one who is possessed of sense will understand. Let
us suppose, however, that these things are true which idle and foolish old men vainly say,
that we may refute them especially by their own feelings and arguments.</p>
<p>If men were collected together on this account, that they might protect their weakness
by mutual help, therefore we must succour man, who needs help. For, since men entered
into and contracted fellowship with men for the sake of protection, either to violate or not
to preserve that compact which was entered into among men from the commencement of
their origin, is to be considered as the greatest impiety. For he who withdraws himself from
affording assistance must also of necessity withdraw himself from receiving it; for he who
refuses his aid to another thinks that he stands in need of the aid of none. But he who
withdraws and separates himself from the body1153 at large, must live not after the custom
of men, but after the manner of wild beasts. But if this cannot be done, the bond of human
society is by all means to be retained, because man can in no way live without man. But the
preservation1154 of society is a mutual sharing of kind offices; that is, the affording help,
that we may be able to receive it. But if, as those others assert, the assembling together of
men has been caused on account of humanity itself, man ought undoubtedly to recognise
man. But if those ignorant and as yet uncivilized men did this, and that, when the practice
of speaking was not yet established, what must we think ought to be done by men who are
polished, and connected together by interchange of conversation and all business, who,
being accustomed to the society of men, cannot endure solitude?</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF THE PERSONS UPON WHOM A BENEFIT IS TO BE CONFERRED.</head>
<p>Therefore humanity is to be preserved, if we wish rightly to be called men. But what
else is this preservation of humanity than the loving a man because he is a man, and the
same as ourselves? Therefore discord and dissension are not in accordance with the nature
of man; and that expression of Cicero is true, which says1155 that man, while he is obedient
to nature, cannot injure man. Therefore, if it is contrary to nature to injure a man, it must
be in accordance with nature to benefit a man; and he who does not do this deprives himself
of the title of a man, because it is the duty of humanity to succour the necessity and peril of
a man. I ask, therefore, of those who do not think it the part of a wise man to be prevailed
upon and to pity, If a man were seized by some beast, and were to implore the aid of an
armed man, whether they think that he ought to be succoured or not? They are not so
shameless as to deny that that ought to be done which humanity demands and requires.
Also, if any one were surrounded by fire, crushed by the downfall of a building, plunged in
the sea, or carried away by a river, would they think it the duty of a man not to assist him?
They themselves are not men if they think so; for no one can fail to be liable to dangers of
this kind. Yes, truly, they will say that it is the part of a human being, and of a brave man
too, to preserve one who was on the point of perishing. If, therefore, in casualties of this
nature which imperil the life of man, they allow that it is the part of humanity to give succour,
what reason is there why they should think that succour is to be withheld if a man should
suffer from hunger, thirst, or cold? But though these things are naturally on an equality with
those accidental circumstances, and need one and the same humanity, yet they make a distinction
between these things, because they measure all things not by the truth itself, but by
present utility. For they hope that those whom they rescue from peril will make a return of
the favour to them. But because they do not hope for this in the case of the needy, they think
that whatever they bestow on men of this kind is thrown away. Hence that sentiment of
Plautus is detestable:1156—
<lg>
<l>“He deserves ill who gives food to a beggar;</l>
<l>For that which he gives is thrown away, and</l>
<l>It lengthens out the life of the other to his misery.”</l>
</lg>
But perhaps the poet spoke for the actor.1157</p>
<p>What does Marcus Tullius say in his books respecting Offices? Does he not also advise
that bounty should not be employed at all? For thus he speaks:1158 “Bounty, which proceeds
<note type="footnote">1155 De Offic., iii. 5.</note>

<pb n="387"/>
from our estate, drains the very source of our liberality; and thus liberality is destroyed by
liberality: for the more numerous they are towards whom you practice it, the less you will
be able to practice it towards many.” And he also says shortly afterwards: “But what is more
foolish than so to act that you may not be able to continue to do that which you do willingly?”
This professor of wisdom plainly keeps men back from acts of kindness, and advises them
carefully to guard their property, and to preserve their money-chest in safety, rather than
to follow justice. And when he perceived that this was inhuman and wicked, soon afterwards,
in another chapter, as though moved by repentance, he thus spoke: “Sometimes, however,
we must exercise bounty in giving: nor is this kind of liberality altogether to be rejected; and
we must give from our property to suitable1159 persons when they are in need of assistance.”
What is the meaning of “suitable?” Assuredly those who are able to restore and give back
the favour.1160 If Cicero were now alive, I should certainly exclaim: Here, here, Marcus
Tullius, you have erred from true justice; and you have taken it away by one word, since
you measured the offices of piety and humanity by utility. For we must not bestow our
bounty on suitable objects, but as much as possible on unsuitable objects. For that will be
done with justice, piety, and humanity, which you shall do without the hope of any return!</p>
<p>This is that true and genuine justice, of which you say that you have no real and life-like
figure.1161 You yourself exclaim in many places that virtue is not mercenary; and you confess
in the books of your Laws1162 that liberality is gratuitous, in these words: “Nor is it doubtful
that he who is called liberal and generous is influenced by a sense of duty, and not by advantage.”
Why therefore do you bestow your bounty on suitable persons, unless it be that you
may afterwards receive a reward? With you, therefore, as the author and teacher of justice,
whosoever shall not be a suitable person will be worn out with nakedness, thirst, and hunger;
nor will men who are rich and abundantly supplied, even to luxuriousness, assist his last
extremity. If virtue does not exact a reward; if, as you say, it is to be sought on its own account,
then estimate justice, which is the mother and chief of the virtues, at its own price, and not
according to your advantage: give especially to him from whom you hope for nothing in
return. Why do you select persons? Why do you look at bodily forms? He is to be esteemed
by you as a man, whoever it is that implores you, because he considers you a man. Cast away
those outlines and sketches of justice, and hold fast justice itself, true and fashioned to the

passed into this sense in later times, it is plain from the very words of Cicero himself that he uses it of deserving

life. Be bountiful to the blind, the feeble, the lame, the destitute, who must die unless you
bestow your bounty upon them. They are useless to men, but they are serviceable to God,
who retains them in life, who endues them with breath, who vouchsafes to them the light.
Cherish as far as in you lies, and support with kindness, the lives of men, that they may not
be extinguished. He who is able to succour one on the point of perishing, if he fails to do
so, kills him. But they, because they neither retain their nature, nor know what reward there
is in this, while they fear to lose, do lose, and fall into that which they chiefly guard against;
so that whatever they bestow is either lost altogether, or profits only for the briefest time.</p>
<p>For they who refuse a small gift to the wretched, who wish to preserve humanity without
any loss to themselves, squander their property, so that they either acquire for themselves
frail and perishable things, or they certainly gain nothing by their own great loss.
For what must be said of those who, induced by the vanity of popular favour,1163 expend
on the exhibition of shows wealth that would be sufficient even for great cities? Must we
not say that they are senseless and mad who bestow upon the people that which is both lost
to themselves, and which none of those on whom it is bestowed receives? Therefore, as all
pleasure is short and perishable, and especially that of the eyes and ears, men either forget
and are ungrateful for the expenses incurred by another, or they are even offended if the
caprice of the people is not satisfied: so that most foolish men have even acquired evil for
themselves by evil; or if they have thus succeeded in pleasing, they gain nothing more than
empty favour and the talk1164 of a few days. Thus every day the estates of most trifling men
are expended on superfluous matters. Do they then act more wisely who exhibit to their
fellow-citizens more useful and lasting gifts? They, for instance, who by the building of
public works seek a lasting memory for their name? Not even do they act rightly in burying
their property in the earth; because the remembrance of them neither bestows anything
upon the dead, nor are their works eternal, inasmuch as they are either thrown down and
destroyed by a single earthquake, or are consumed by an accidental fire, or they are over
through by some attack of an enemy, or at any rate they decay and fall to pieces by mere
length of time. For there is nothing, as the orator says,1165 made by the work of man’s hand
which length of time does not weaken and destroy. But this justice of which we speak, and
mercy, flourish more every day. They therefore act better who bestow their bounty on their
tribesmen and clients, for they bestow something on men, and profit them; but that is not
true and just bounty, for there is no conferring of a benefit where there is no necessity.
Therefore, whatever is given to those who are not in need, for the sake of popularity, is
thrown away; or it is repaid with interest, and thus it will not be the conferring of a benefit.

done, no evil follows. Therefore the only sure and true office of liberality is to support the

<head>CHAP. XII.—OF THE KINDS OF BENEFICENCE, AND WORKS OF MERCY.</head>
<p>This is that perfect justice which protects human society, concerning which philosophers
speak. This is the chief and truest advantage of riches; not to use wealth for the particular
pleasure of an individual, but for the welfare of many; not for one’s own immediate enjoyment,
but for justice, which alone does not perish. We must therefore by all means keep in
mind, that the hope of receiving in return must be altogether absent from the duty of
showing mercy: for the reward of this work and duty must be expected from God alone; for
if you should expect it from man, then that will not be kindness, but the lending of a benefit
at interest;1166 nor can he seem to have deserved well who affords that which he does, not
to another, but to himself. And yet the matter comes to this, that whatever a man has bestowed
upon another, hoping for no advantage from him, he really bestows upon himself,
for he will receive a reward from God. God has also enjoined, that if at any time we make
a feast, we should invite to the entertainment those who cannot invite us in return, and thus
make us a recompense, so that no action of our life should be without the exercise of mercy.
Nor, however, let any one think that he is debarred from intercourse with his friends or
kindness with his neighbours. But God has made known to us what is our true and just
work: we ought thus to live with our neighbours, provided that we know that the one manner
of living relates to man, the other to God.1167</p>
<p>Therefore hospitality is a principal virtue, as the philosophers also say; but they turn it
aside from true justice, and forcibly apply1168 it to advantage. Cicero says:1169 “Hospitality
was rightly praised by Theophrastus. For (as it appears to me) it is highly becoming that the
houses of illustrious men should be open to illustrious guests.” He has here committed the
same error which he then did, when he said that we must bestow our bounty on “suitable”
persons. For the house of a just and wise man ought not to be open to the illustrious, but
to the lowly and abject. For those illustrious and powerful men cannot be in want of anything,
since they are sufficiently protected and honoured by their own opulence. But nothing is
to be done by a just man except that which is a benefit. But if the benefit is returned, it is
destroyed and brought to an end; for we cannot possess in its completeness that for which
a price has been paid to us. Therefore the principle of justice is employed about those benefits
which have remained safe and uncorrupted; but they cannot thus remain by any other means
than if they are be stowed upon those men who can in no way profit us. But in receiving il-

<note type="footnote">1167 The meaning appears to be this: To benefit our friends and relatives, relates to man, i.e., is a merely

lustrious men, he looked to nothing else but utility; nor did the ingenious man conceal what
advantage he hoped from it. For he says that he who does that will become powerful among
foreigners by the favour of the leading men, whom he will have bound to himself by the
right of hospitality and friendship. O by how many arguments might the inconsistency of
Cicero be proved, if this were my object! Nor would he be convicted so much by my words
as by his own. For he also says, that the more any one refers all his actions to his own advantage,
the less he is a good man. He also says, that it is not the part of a simple and open man
to ingratiate himself in the favour of others,1170 to pretend and allege anything, to appear
to be doing one thing when he is doing another, to feign that he is bestowing upon another
that which he is bestowing upon himself; but that this is rather the part of one who is
designing1171 and crafty, deceitful and treacherous. But how could he maintain that that
ambitious hospitality was not evil intention?1172 “Do you run round through all the gates,
that you may invite to your house the chief men of the nations and cities as they arrive, that
by their means you may acquire influence with their citizens; and wish yourself to be called
just, and kind, and hospitable, though you are studying to promote your own advantage?”
But did he not say this rather incautiously? For what is less suitable for Cicero? But through
his ignorance of true justice he knowingly and with foresight fell into this snare. And that
he might be pardoned for this, he testified that he does not give precepts with reference to
true justice, which he does not hold, but with reference to a sketch and outline of justice.
Therefore we must pardon this teacher who uses sketches and outlines,1173 nor must we
require the truth from him who admits that he is ignorant of it.</p>
<p>The ransoming of captives is a great and noble exercise of justice, of which the same
Tullius also approved.1174 “And this liberality,” he says, “is serviceable even to the state,
that captives should be ransomed from slavery, and that those of slender resources should
be provided for. And I greatly prefer this practice of liberality to lavish expenditure on shows.
This is the part of great and eminent men.” Therefore it is the appropriate work of the just
to support the poor and to ransom captives, since among the unjust if any do these things
they are called great and eminent. For it is deserving of the greatest praise for those to confer
benefit from whom no one expected such conduct. For he who does good to a relative, or
neighbour, or friend, either deserves no praise, or certainly no great praise, because he is
bound to do it, and he would be impious and detestable if he did not do that which both

nature itself and relationship require; and if he does it, he does it not so much for the sake
of obtaining glory as of avoiding censure. But he who does it to a stranger and an unknown
person, he truly is worthy of praise, because he was led to do it by kindness only. Justice
therefore exists there, where there is no obligation of necessity for conferring a benefit. He
ought not therefore to have preferred this duty of generosity to expenditure on shows; for
this is the part of one making a comparison, and of two goods choosing that which is the
better. For that profusion of men throwing away their property into the sea is vain and trifling,
and very far removed from all justice. Therefore they are not even to be called gifts,1175
in which no one receives but he who does not deserve to receive.</p>
<p>Nor is it less a great work of justice to protect and defend orphans and widows who are
destitute and stand in need of assistance; and therefore that divine law prescribes this to all,
since all good judges deem that it belongs to their office to favour them with natural kindness,
and to strive to benefit them. But these works are especially ours, since we have received
the law, and the words of God Himself giving us instructions. For they perceive that it is
naturally just to protect those who need protection, but they do not perceive why it is so.
For God, to whom everlasting mercy belongs, on this account commands that widows and
orphans should be defended and cherished, that no one through regard and pity for his
pledges1176 should be prevented from undergoing death in behalf of justice and faith, but
should encounter it with promptitude and boldness, since he knows that he leaves his beloved
ones to the care of God, and that they will never want protection. Also to undertake the care
and support of the sick, who need some one to assist them, is the part of the greatest kindness,
and of great beneficence;1177 and he who shall do this will both gain a living sacrifice to
God, and that which he has given to another for a time he will himself receive from God for
eternity. The last and greatest office of piety is the burying of strangers and the poor; which
subject those teachers of virtue and justice have not touched upon at all. For they were unable
to see this, who measured all their duties by utility. For in the other things which have been
mentioned above, although they did not keep the true path, yet, since they discovered some
advantage in these things, retained as it were by a kind of inkling1178 of the truth, they
wandered to a less distance; but they abandoned this because they were unable to see any
advantage in it.</p>

<p>Moreover, there have not been wanting those who esteemed burial as superfluous, and
said that it was no evil to lie unburied and neglected; but their impious wisdom is rejected
alike by the whole human race, and by the divine expressions which command the performance
of the rite.1179 But they do not venture to say that it ought not to be done, but that, if
it happens to be omitted, no inconvenience is the result. Therefore in that matter they discharge
the office, not so much of those who give precepts, as of those who suggest consolation,
that if this shall by chance have occurred to a wise man, he should not deem himself wretched
on this account. But we do not speak of that which ought to be endured by a wise man, but
of that which he himself ought to do. Therefore we do not now inquire whether the whole
system of burial is serviceable or not; but this, even though it be useless, as they imagine,
must nevertheless be practised, even on this account only, that it appears among men to be
done rightly and kindly. For it is the feeling which is inquired into, and it is the purpose
which is weighed. Therefore we will not suffer the image and workmanship of God to lie
exposed as a prey to beasts and birds, but we will restore it to the earth, from which it had
its origin; and although it be in the case of an unknown man, we will fulfil the office of relatives,
into whose place, since they are wanting, let kindness succeed; and wherever there
shall be need of man, there we will think that our duty is required.1180 But in what does the
nature of justice more consist than in our affording to strangers through kindness, that
which we render to our own relatives through affection? And this kindness is much more
sure and just when it is now afforded, not to the man who is insensible, but to God alone,
to whom a just work is a most acceptable sacrifice. Some one will perhaps say: If I shall do
all these things, I shall have no possessions. For what if a great number of men shall be in
want, shall suffer cold, shall be taken captive, shall die, since one who acts thus must deprive
himself of his property even in a single day, shall I throw away the estate acquired by my
own labour or by that of my ancestors, so that after this I myself must live by the pity of
others?</p>
<p>Why do you so pusillanimously fear poverty, which even your philosophers praise, and
bear witness that nothing is safer and nothing more calm than this? That which you fear is
a haven against anxieties. Do you not know to how many dangers, to how many accidents,
you are exposed with these evil resources? These will treat you well if they shall pass without
your bloodshed. But you walk about laden with booty, and you bear spoils which may excite
the minds even of your own relatives. Why, then, do you hesitate to lay that out well which
perhaps a single robbery will snatch away from you, or a proscription suddenly arising, or
the plundering of an enemy? Why do you fear to make a frail and perishable good everlasting,
or to entrust your treasures to God as their preserver, in which case you need not fear thief

and robber, nor rust, nor tyrant? He who is rich towards God can never be poor.1181 If you
esteem justice so highly, lay aside the burthens which press you, and follow it; free yourself
from fetters and chains, that you may run to God without any impediment. It is the part of
a great and lofty mind to despise and trample upon mortal affairs. But if you do not comprehend
this virtue, that you may bestow your riches upon the altar1182 of God, in order that
you may provide for yourself firmer possessions than these frail ones, I will free you from
fear. All these precepts are not given to you alone, but to all the people who are united in
mind, and hold together as one man. If you are not adequate to the performance of great
works alone, cultivate justice with all your power, in such a manner, however, that you may
excel others in work as much as you excel them in riches. And do not think that you are
advised to lessen or exhaust your property; but that which you would have expended on
superfluities, turn to better uses. Devote to the ransoming of captives that from which you
purchase beasts; maintain the poor with that from which you feed wild beasts; bury the innocent
dead with that from which you provide men for the sword.1183 What does it profit
to enrich men of abandoned wickedness, who fight with beasts,1184 and to equip them for
crimes? Transfer things about to be miserably thrown away to the great sacrifice, that in
return for these true gifts you may have an everlasting gift from God. Mercy has a great reward;
for God promises it, that He will remit all sins. If you shall hear, He says, the prayers
of your suppliant, I also will hear yours; if you shall pity those in distress, I also will pity you
in your distress. But if you shall not regard nor assist them, I also will bear a mind like your
own against you, and I will judge you by your own laws.1185</p>

<head>CHAP. XIII.—OF REPENTANCE, OF MERCY, AND THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.</head>
<p>As often, therefore, as you are asked for aid, believe that you are tried by God, that it
may be seen whether you are worthy of being heard. Examine your own conscience, and,
as far as you are able, heal your wounds. Nor, however, because offences are removed by
bounty, think that a licence is given you for sinning. For they are done away with, if you are
bountiful to God because you have sinned; for if you sin through reliance on your bounty,
they are not done away with. For God especially desires that men shall be cleansed from
their sins, and therefore He commands them to repent. But to repent is nothing else than
to profess and to affirm that one will sin no more. Therefore they are pardoned who unawares
and incautiously glide into sin; he who sins wilfully has no pardon. Nor, however, if any
one shall have been purified from all stain of sin, let him think that he may abstain from the
work of bounty because he has no faults to blot out. Nay, in truth, he is then more bound
to exercise justice when he is become just, so that that which he had before done for the
healing of his wounds he may afterwards do for the praise and glory of virtue. To this is
added, that no one can be without fault as long as he is burthened with a covering of flesh,
the infirmity of which is subject to the dominion of sin in a threefold manner—in deeds, in
words, and thoughts.</p>
<p>By these steps justice advances to the greatest height. The first step of virtue is to abstain
from evil works; the second, to abstain also from evil words; the third, to abstain even from
the thoughts of evil things. He who ascends the first step is sufficiently just; he who ascends
the second is now of perfect virtue, since he offends neither in deeds nor in conversation;1186
he who ascends the third appears truly to have attained the likeness of God. For it is almost
beyond the measure of man not even to admit to the thought1187 that which is either bad
in action or improper in speech. Therefore even just men, who can refrain from every unjust
work, are sometimes, however, overcome by frailty itself, so that they either speak evil in
anger, or, at the sight of delightful things, they desire them with silent thought. But if the
condition of mortality does not suffer a man to be pure from every stain, the faults of the
flesh ought therefore to be done away with by continual bounty. For it is the single work of
a man who is wise, and just, and worthy of life, to lay out his riches on justice alone; for assuredly
he who is without this, although he should surpass Croesus or Crassus in riches, is
to be esteemed as poor, as naked, as a beggar. Therefore we must use our efforts that we
may be clothed with the garment of justice and piety, of which no one may deprive us, which
may furnish us with an everlasting ornament. For if the worshippers of gods adore senseless
images, and bestow upon them whatever they have which is precious, though they can
neither make use of them nor give thanks because they have received them, how much more

just and true is it to reverence the living images of God, that you may gain the favour of the
living God! For as these make use of what they have received, and give thanks, so God, in
whose sight you shall have done that which is good, will both approve of it and reward your
piety.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIV.—OF THE AFFECTIONS, AND THE OPINION OF THE STOICS
RESPECTING THEM; AND OF VIRTUE, THE VICES, AND MERCY.</head>
<p>If, therefore, mercy is a distinguished and excellent gift in man, and that is judged to be
very good by the consent both of the good and the evil, it appears that philosophers were
far distant from the good of man, who neither enjoined nor practised anything of this kind,
but always esteemed as a vice that virtue which almost holds the first place in man. It pleases
me here to bring forward one subject of philosophy, that we may more fully refute the errors
of those who call mercy, desire, and fear, diseases of the soul. They indeed attempt to distinguish
virtues from vices, which is truly a very easy matter. For who cannot distinguish a
liberal man from one who is prodigal (as they do), or a frugal man from one who is mean,
or a calm man from one who is slothful, or a cautious man from one who is timid? Because
these things which are good have their limits, and if they shall exceed these limits, fall into
vices; so that constancy, unless it is undertaken for the truth, becomes shamelessness. In
like manner, bravery, if it shall undergo certain danger, without the compulsion of any necessity,
or not for an honourable cause, is changed into rashness. Freedom of speech also,
if it attack others rather than oppose those who attack it, is obstinacy. Severity also, unless
it restrain itself within the befitting punishments of the guilty, becomes savage cruelty.</p>
<p>Therefore they say, that those who appear evil do not sin of their own accord, or choose
evils by preference, but that, erring1188 through the appearance of good, they fall into evils,
while they are ignorant of the distinction between good things and evil. These things are
not indeed false, but they are all referred to the body. For to be frugal, or constant, or cautious,
or calm, or grave, or severe, are virtues indeed, but virtues which relate to this short1189 life.
But we who despise this life have other virtues set before us, respecting which philosophers
could not by any means even conjecture. Therefore they regarded certain virtues as vices,
and certain vices as virtues. For the Stoics take away from man all the affections, by the impulse
of which the soul is moved—desire, joy, fear, sorrow: the two former of which arise
from good things, either future or present; the latter from evil things. In the same manner,
they call these four (as I said) diseases, not so much inserted in us by nature as undertaken
through a perverted opinion; and therefore they think that these can be eradicated, if the
false notion of good and evil things is taken away. For if the wise man thinks nothing good
or evil, he will neither be inflamed with desire, nor be transported with joy, nor be alarmed
with fear, nor suffer his spirits to droop1190 through sadness. We shall presently see
whether they effect that which they wish, or what it is which they do effect: in the meantime

<pb n="399"/>
<head>CHAP. XV.—OF THE AFFECTIONS, AND THE OPINION OF THE PERIPATETICS
RESPECTING THEM.</head>
<p>For, that these things are natural and not voluntary, the nature of all living beings shows,
which is moved by all these affections. Therefore the Peripatetics act better, who say that
all these cannot be taken from us, because they were born with us; and they endeavour to
show how providently and how necessarily God, or nature (for so they term it), armed us
with these affections; which, however, because they generally become vicious if they are in
excess, can be advantageously regulated by man,—a limit being applied, so that there may
be left to man as much as is sufficient for nature. Not an unwise disputation, if, as I said, all
things were not referred to this life. The Stoics therefore are mad who do not regulate but
cut them out, and wish by some means or other to deprive man of powers implanted in him
by nature. And this is equivalent to a desire of taking away timidity from stags, or poison
from serpents, or rage from wild beasts, or gentleness from cattle. For those qualities which
have been given separately to dumb animals, are altogether given to man at the same time.
But if, as physicians affirm, the affection of joy has its seat in the spleen,1191 that of anger
in the gall, of desire in the liver, of fear in the heart, it is easier to kill the animal itself than
to tear anything from the body; for this is to wish to change the nature of the living creature.
But the skilful men do not understand that when they take away vices from man, they also
take away virtue, for which alone they are making a place. For if it is virtue in the midst of
the impetuosity of anger to restrain and check oneself, which they cannot deny, then he
who is without anger is also without virtue. If it is virtue to control the lust of the body, he
must be free from virtue who has no lust which he may regulate. If it is virtue to curb the
desire from coveting that which belongs to another, he certainly can have no virtue who is
without that, to the restraining of which the exercise of virtue is applied. Where, therefore,
there are no vices, there is no place even for virtue, as there is no place for victory where
there is no adversary. And so it comes to pass that there can be no good in this life without
evil. An affection therefore is a kind of natural fruitfulness1192 of the powers of the mind.
For as a field which is naturally fruitful produces an abundant crop of briars,1193 so the
mind which is uncultivated is overgrown with vices flourishing of their own accord, as with
thorns. But when the true cultivator has applied himself, immediately vices give way, and
the fruits of virtues spring up.</p>
<p>Therefore God, when He first made man, with wonderful foresight first implanted in
him these emotions of the mind, that he might be capable of receiving virtue, as the earth

<pb n="400"/>
is of cultivation; and He placed the subject-matter of vices in the affections, and that of virtue
in vices. For assuredly virtue will have no existence, or not be in exercise, if those things are
wanting by which its power is either shown or exists. Now let us see what they have effected
who altogether removes vices. With regard to those four affections1194 which they imagine
to arise from the opinion of things good and evil, by the eradication of which they think
that the mind of the wise man is to be healed, since they understand that they are implanted
by nature, and that without these nothing can be put in motion, nothing be done, they put
certain other things into their place and room: for desire they substitute inclination, as
though it were not much better to desire a good than to feel inclination for it; they in like
manner substitute for joy gladness, and for fear caution. But in the case of the fourth they
are at a loss for a method of exchanging the name. Therefore they have altogether taken
away grief, that is, sadness and pain of mind, which cannot possibly be done. For who can
fail to be grieved if pestilence has desolated his country, or an enemy overthrown it, or a
tyrant crushed its liberty? Can any one fail to be grieved if he has beheld the overthrow of
liberty,1195 and the banishment or most cruel slaughter of neighbours, friends, or good
men?—unless the mind of any one should be so struck with astonishment that all sensibility
should be taken from him. Wherefore they ought either to have taken away the whole, or
this defective1196 and weak discussion ought to have been completed; that is, something
ought to have been substituted in the place of grief, since, the former ones having been so
arranged, this naturally followed.</p>
<p>For as we rejoice in good things that are present, so we are vexed and grieved with evil
things. If, therefore, they gave another name to joy because they thought it vicious, so it was
befitting that another name should be given to grief because they thought it also vicious.
From which it appears that it was not the object itself which was wanting to them, but a
word, through want of which they wished, contrary to what nature allowed, to take away
that affection which is the greatest. For I could have refuted those changes of names at
greater length, and have shown that many names are attached to the same objects, for the
sake of embellishing the style and increasing its copiousness, or at any rate that they do not
greatly differ from one another. For both desire takes its beginning from the inclination,
and caution arises from fear, and joy is nothing else than the expression of gladness. But let
us suppose that they are different, as they themselves will have it. Accordingly they will say
that desire is continued and perpetual inclination, but that joy is gladness bearing itself immoderately;
and that fear is caution in excess, and passing the limits of moderation. Thus
it comes to pass, that they do not take away those things which they think ought to be taken
<note type="footnote">1194 [Cap. xiv. p. 179, supra.]</note>

<note type="footnote">1196 Curta, i.e., “maimed.”</note>

<pb n="401"/>
away, but regulate them, since the names only are changed, the things themselves remain.
They therefore return unawares to that point at which the Peripatetics arrive by argument,
that vices, since they cannot be taken away, are to be regulated with moderation. Therefore
they err, because they do not succeed in effecting that which they aim at, and by a circuitous
route, which is long and rough, they return to the same path.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—OF THE AFFECTIONS, AND THE REFUTATION OF THE OPINION
OF THE PERIPATETICS CONCERNING THEM; WHAT IS THE PROPER USE OF
THE AFFECTIONS, AND WHAT IS A BAD USE OF THEM.</head>
<p>But I think that the Peripatetics did not even approach the truth, who allow that they
are vices, but regulate them with moderation. For we must be free even from moderate vices;
yea, rather, it ought to have been at first effected that there should be no vices. For nothing
can be born vicious;1197 but if we make a bad use of the affections they become vices, if we
use them well they become virtues. Then it must be shown that the causes of the affections,
and not the affections themselves, must be moderated. We must not, they say, rejoice with
excessive joy, but moderately and temperately. This is as though they should say that we
must not run swiftly, but walk quietly. But it is possible that he who walks may err, and that
he who runs may keep the right path. What if I show that there is a case in which it is vicious
not only to rejoice moderately, but even in the smallest degree; and that there is another
case, on the contrary, in which even to exult with transports of joy is by no means faulty?
What then, I pray, will this mediocrity profit us? I ask whether they think that a wise man
ought to rejoice if he sees any evil happening to his enemy; or whether he ought to curb his
joy, if by the conquest of enemies, or the overthrow of a tyrant, liberty and safety have been
acquired by his countrymen.1198</p>
<p>No one doubts but that in the former case to rejoice a little, and in the latter to rejoice
too little, is a very great crime. We may say the same respecting the other affections. But, as
I have said, the object of wisdom does not consist in the regulation of these, but of their
causes, since they are acted upon from without; nor was it befitting that these themselves
should be restrained; since they may exist in a small degree with the greatest criminality,
and in the greatest degree without any criminality. But they ought to have been assigned to
fixed times, and circumstances, and places, that they may not be vices, when it is permitted
us to make a right use of them. For as to walk in the right course is good, but to wander
from it is evil, so to be moved by the affections to that which is right is good, but to that
which is corrupt is evil. For sensual desire, if it does not wander from its lawful object, although
it be ardent, yet is without fault. But if it desires an unlawful object, although it be
moderate, yet it is a great vice. Therefore it is not a disease to be angry, nor to desire, nor to
be excited by lust; but to be passionate, to be covetous or licentious, is a disease. For he who
is passionate is angry even with him with whom he ought not to be angry or at times when
he ought not. He who is covetous desires even that which is unnecessary. He who is licentious
pursues even that which is forbidden by the laws. The whole matter ought to have turned
on this, that since the impetuosity of these things cannot be restrained, nor is it right that

it should be, because it is necessarily implanted for maintaining the duties of life, it might
rather be directed into the right way, where it may be possible even to run without stumbling
and danger.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF THE AFFECTIONS AND THEIR USE; OF PATIENCE, AND THE
CHIEF GOOD OF CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>But I have been carried too far in my desire of refuting them; since it is my purpose to
show that those things which the philosophers thought to be vices, are so far from being
vices, that they are even great virtues. Of others, I will take, for the sake of instruction, those
which I think to be most closely related to the subject. They regard dread or fear as a very
great vice, and think that it is a very great weakness of mind; the opposite to which is bravery:
and if this exists in a man, they say that there is no place for fear. Does any one then believe
that it can possibly happen that this same fear is the highest fortitude? By no means. For
nature does not appear to admit that anything should fall back to its contrary. But yet I, not
by any skilful conclusion, as Socrates does in the writings of Plato, who compels those against
whom he disputes to admit those things which they had denied, but in a simple manner,
will show that the greatest fear is the greatest virtue. No one doubts but that it is the part of
a timid and feeble mind either to fear pain, or want, or exile, or imprisonment, or death;
and if any one does not dread all these, he is judged a man of the greatest fortitude. But he
who fears God is free from the fear of all these things. In proof of which, there is no need
of arguments: for the punishments inflicted on the worshippers of God have been witnessed
at all times, and are still witnessed through the world, in the tormenting of whom new and
unusual tortures have been devised. For the mind shrinks from the recollection of various
kinds of death, when the butchery of savage monsters has raged even beyond death itself.
But a happy and unconquered patience endured these execrable lacerations of their bodies
without a groan. This virtue afforded the greatest astonishment to all people and provinces,
and to the torturers themselves, when cruelty was overcome by patience. But this virtue was
caused by nothing else than the fear of God. Therefore (as I said) fear is not to be uprooted,
as the Stoics maintain, nor to be restrained, as the Peripatetics wish, but to be directed into
the right way; and apprehensions are to be taken away, but so that this one only may be left:
for since this is the only lawful and true one, it alone effects that all other things may not be
feared. Desire also is reckoned among vices; but if it desires those things which are of the
earth, it is a vice; on the other hand, if it desires heavenly things, it is a virtue. For he who
desires to obtain justice, God, perpetual life, everlasting light, and all those things which
God promises to man, will despise these riches, and honours, and commands, and kingdoms
themselves.</p>
<p>The Stoic will perhaps say that inclination is necessary for the attainment of these things,
and not desire; but, in truth, the inclination is not sufficient. For many have the inclination;
but when pain has approached the vitals, inclination gives way, but desire perseveres: and
if it effects that all things which are sought by others are objects of contempt to him, it is
the greatest virtue, since it is the mother of self-restraint. And therefore we ought rather to
effect this, that we may rightly direct the affections, a corrupt use of which is vice. For these

<pb n="405"/>
excitements of the mind resemble a harnessed chariot, in the right management of which
the chief duty of the driver is to know the way; and if he shall keep to this, with whatever
swiftness he may go, he will not strike against an obstacle. But if he shall wander from the
course, although he may go calmly and gently, he will either be shaken over rough places,
or will glide over precipices, or at any rate will be carried where he does not need to go. So
that chariot of life which is led by the affections as though by swift horses, if it keeps the
right way, will discharge its duty. Dread, therefore, and desire, if they are cast down to the
earth, will become vices, but they will be virtues if they are referred to divine things. On the
other hand, they esteem parsimony as a virtue; which, if it is eagerness for possessing, cannot
be a virtue, because it is altogether employed in the increase or preservation of earthly goods.
But we do not refer the chief good to the body, but we measure every duty by the preservation
of the soul only. But if, as I have before taught, we must by no means spare our property
that we may preserve kindness and justice, it is not a virtue to be frugal; which name beguiles
and deceives under the appearance of virtue. For frugality is, it is true, the abstaining from
pleasures; but in this respect it is a vice, because it arises from the love of possessing,
whereas we ought both to abstain from pleasures, and by no means to withhold money. For
to use money sparingly, that is, moderately, is a kind of weakness of mind, either of one
fearing lest he should be in want, or of one despairing of being able to recover it, or of one
incapable of the contempt of earthly things. But, on the other hand, they call him who is
not sparing of his property prodigal. For thus they distinguish between the liberal man and
the prodigal: that he is liberal who bestows on deserving objects, and on proper occasions,
and in sufficient quantities; but that he is prodigal who lavishes on undeserving objects, and
when there is no need, and without any regard to his property.</p>
<p>What then? shall we call him prodigal who through pity gives food to the needy? But it
makes a great difference, whether on account of lust you bestow your money on harlots, or
on account of benevolence on the wretched; whether profligates, gamesters, and pimps
squander your money, or you bestow it on piety and God; whether you expend it upon your
own appetite,1199 or lay it up in the treasury of justice. As, therefore, it is a vice to lay it out
badly, so it is a virtue to lay it out well. If it is a virtue not to be sparing of riches, which can
be replaced, that you may support the life of man, which cannot be replaced; then parsimony
is a vice. Therefore I can call them by no other name than mad, who deprive man, a mild
and sociable animal, of his name; who, having uprooted the affections, in which humanity
altogether consists, wish to bring him to an immoveable insensibility of mind, while they
desire to free the soul from perturbations, and, as they themselves say, to render it calm and
tranquil; which is not only impossible, because its force and nature consist in motion, but
it ought not even to be so. For as water which is always still and motionless is unwholesome
<note type="footnote">1199 Ventri ac gulæ ingeras.</note>

<pb n="406"/>
and more muddy, so the soul which is unmoved and torpid is useless even to itself: nor will
it be able to maintain life itself; for it will neither do nor think anything, since thought itself
is nothing less than agitation of the mind. In fine, they who assert this immoveableness of
the soul wish to deprive the soul of life; for life is full of activity, but death is quiet. They also
rightly esteem some things as virtues, but they do not maintain their due proportion.1200</p>
<p>Constancy is a virtue; not that we resist those who injure us, for we must yield to these;
and why this ought to be done I will show presently: but that when men command us to act
in opposition to the law of God, and in opposition to justice, we should be deterred by no
threats or punishments from preferring the command of God to the command of man.
Likewise it is a virtue to despise death; not that we seek it, and of our own accord inflict it
upon ourselves, as many and distinguished philosophers have often done, which is a wicked
and impious thing; but that when compelled to desert God, and to betray our faith, we
should prefer to undergo death, and should defend our liberty against the foolish and
senseless violence of those who cannot govern themselves, and with fortitude of spirit we
should challenge all the threats and terrors of the world. Thus with lofty and invincible mind
we trample upon those things which others fear—pain and death. This is virtue; this is true
constancy—to be maintained and preserved in this one thing alone, that no terror and no
violence may be able to turn us away from God. Therefore that is a true sentiment of
Cicero:1201 “No one,” he says, “can be just who fears death, or pain, or exile, or want.” Also
of Seneca, who says, in his books of moral philosophy: “This is that virtuous man, not distinguished
by a diadem or purple, or the attendance of lictors, but in no respect inferior,
who, when he sees death at hand, is not so disturbed as though he saw a fresh object; who,
whether torments are to be suffered by his whole body, or a flame is to be seized by his
mouth, or his hands are to be stretched out on the cross,1202 does not inquire what he suffers,
but how well.” But he who worships God suffers these things without fear. Therefore he is
just. By these things it is effected, that he cannot know or maintain at all either the virtues
or the exact limits of the virtues, whoever is estranged from the religion of the one God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF SOME COMMANDS OF GOD, AND OF PATIENCE.</head>
<p>But let us leave the philosophers, who either know nothing at all, and hold forth this
very ignorance as the greatest knowledge; or who, inasmuch as they think they know that
of which they are ignorant, are absurdly and arrogantly foolish. Let us therefore (that we
may return to our purpose), to whom alone the truth has been revealed by God, and wisdom
has been sent from heaven, practice those things which God who enlightens us commands:
let us sustain and endure the labours of life, by mutual assistance towards each other; nor,
however, if we shall have done any good work, let us aim at glory from it. For God admonishes
us that the doer of justice ought not to be boastful, lest he should appear to have discharged
the duties of benevolence, not so much from a desire of obeying the divine commands,
as of pleasing men, and should already have the reward of glory which he has aimed
at, and should not receive the recompense of that heavenly and divine reward. The other
things which the worshipper of God ought to observe are easy, when these virtues are
comprehended, that no one should ever speak falsely for the sake of deceiving or injuring.
For it is unlawful for him who cultivates truth to be deceitful in anything, and to depart
from the truth itself which he follows. In this path of justice and all the virtues there is no
place for falsehood. Therefore the true and just traveller will not use the saying of
Lucilius:1203—
<lg>
<l>“It is not for me to speak falsely to a man who is a friend and acquaintance;”</l>
</lg>
but he will think that it is not his part to speak falsely even to an enemy and a stranger; nor
will he at any time so act, that his tongue, which is the interpreter of his mind, should be at
variance with his feeling and thought. If he shall have lent any money, he will not receive
interest, that the benefit may be unimpaired which succours necessity, and that he may entirely
abstain from the property of another. For in this kind of duty he ought to be content
with that which is his own; since it is his duty in other respects not to be sparing of his
property, in order that he may do good; but to receive more than he has given is unjust.
And he who does this lies in wait in some manner, that he may gain booty from the necessity
of another.</p>
<p>But the just man will omit no opportunity of doing anything mercifully: nor will he
pollute himself with gain of this kind; but he will so act that without any loss to himself, that
which he lends may be reckoned among his good works. He must not receive a gift from a
poor man; so that if he himself has afforded anything, it may be good, inasmuch as it is
gratuitous. If any one reviles, he must answer him with a blessing;1204 he himself must
never revile, that no evil word may proceed out of the mouth of a man who reverences the
<note type="footnote">1203 [Homini amico ac familiari non est mentiri meum.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1204 Matt. v. 44; Luke vi. 28; Rom. xii. 14.</note>

<pb n="408"/>
good Word.1205 Moreover, he must also diligently take care, lest by any fault of his he should
at any time make an enemy; and if any one should be so shameless as to inflict injury on a
good and just man, he must bear it with calmness and moderation, and not take upon
himself his revenge, but reserve it for the judgment of God.1206 He must at all times and in
all places guard innocence. And this precept is not limited to this, that he should not himself
inflict injury, but that he should not avenge it when inflicted on himself. For there sits on
the judgment-seat a very great and impartial Judge, the observer and witness of all. Let him
prefer Him to man; let him rather choose that He should pronounce judgment respecting
his cause, whose sentence no one can escape, either by the advocacy of any one or by favour.
Thus it comes to pass, that a just man is an object of contempt to all; and because it will be
thought that he is unable to defend himself, he will be regarded as slothful and inactive; but
if any one shall have avenged himself upon his enemy, he is judged a man of spirit and
activity—all honour and reverence him. And although the good man has it in his power to
profit many, yet they look up to him who is able to injure, rather than to him who is able
to profit. But the depravity of men will not be able to corrupt the just man, so that he will
not endeavour to obey God; and he would prefer to be despised, provided that he may always
discharge the duty of a good man, and never of a bad man. Cicero says in those same books
respecting Offices: “But if any one should wish to unravel this indistinct conception of his
soul,1207 let him at once teach himself that he is a good man who profits those whom he
can, and injures no one1208 unless provoked by injury.”</p>
<p>Oh how he marred a simple and true sentiment by the addition of two words! For what
need was there of adding these words, “unless provoked by injury?” that he might append
vice as a most disgraceful tail to a good man and might represent him as without patience,
which is the greatest of all the virtues. He said that a good man would inflict injuries if he
were provoked: now he must necessarily lose the name of a good man from this very circumstance,
if he shall inflict injury. For it is not less the part of a bad man to return an injury
than to inflict it. For from what source do contests, from what source do fightings and
contentions, arise among men, except that impatience opposed to injustice often excites
great tempests? But if you meet injustice with patience, than which virtue nothing can be
found more true, nothing more worthy of a man, it will immediately be extinguished, as
though you should pour water upon a fire. But if that injustice which provokes opposition
has met with impatience equal1209 to itself, as though overspread with oil, it will excite so

<pb n="409"/>
great a conflagration, that no stream can extinguish it, but only the shedding of blood. Great,
therefore, is the advantage of patience, of which the wise man has deprived the good man.
For this alone causes that no evil happens; and if it should be given to all, there will be no
wickedness and no fraud in the affairs of men. What, therefore, can be so calamitous to a
good man, so opposed to his character, as to let loose the reins to anger, which deprives him
not only of the title of a good man, but even of a man; since to injure another, as he himself
most truly says, is not in accordance with the nature of man? For if you provoke cattle or
horses,1210 they turn against you either with their hoof or their horn; and serpents and wild
beasts, unless you pursue them that you may kill them, give no trouble. And to return to
examples of men, even the inexperienced and the foolish, if at any time they receive an injury,
are led by a blind and irrational fury, and endeavour to retaliate upon those who injure
them. In what respect, then, does the wise and good man differ from the evil and foolish,
except that he has invincible patience, of which the foolish are destitute; except that he
knows how to govern himself, and to mitigate his anger, which those, because they are
without virtue, are unable to curb? But this circumstance manifestly deceived him, because,
when inquiry is made respecting virtue, he thought that it is the part of virtue to conquer
in every kind of contention. Nor was he able in any way to see, that a man who gives way
to grief and anger, and who indulges these affections, against which he ought rather to
struggle, and who rushes wherever injustice shall have called him, does not fulfil the duty
of virtue. For he who endeavours to return an injury, desires to imitate that very person by
whom he has been injured. Thus he who imitates a bad man can by no means be good.</p>
<p>Therefore by two words he has taken away from the good and wise man two of the
greatest virtues, innocence and patience. But, as Sallustius relates was said by Appius, because
he himself practised that canine1211 eloquence, be wished man also to live after the manner
of a dog, so as, when attacked, to bite in return. And to show how pernicious this repayment
of insult is, and what carnage it is accustomed to produce, from what can a more befitting
example be sought, than from the most melancholy disaster of the teacher himself, who,
while he desired to obey these precepts of the philosophers, destroyed himself? For if, when
attacked with injury, he had preserved patience—if he had learned that it is the part of a
good man to dissemble and to endure insult, and his impatience, vanity, and madness had
not poured forth those noble orations, inscribed with a name derived from another
source,1212 he would never, by his head affixed to them, have polluted the rostra on which
<note type="footnote">1210 Pecudes, including horses and cattle.</note>

<note type="footnote">1212 The allusion is to the Philippics of Cicero, a title borrowed from Demosthenes.</note>

<pb n="410"/>
he had formerly distinguished himself, nor would that proscription have utterly destroyed
the state. Therefore it is not the part of a wise and good man to wish to contend, and to
commit himself to danger, since to conquer is not in our power, and every contest is
doubtful; but it is the part of a wise and excellent man not to wish to remove his adversary,
which cannot be done without guilt and danger, but to put an end to the contest itself, which
may be done with advantage and with justice. Therefore patience is to be regarded as a very
great virtue; and that the just man might obtain this, God willed, as has been before said,
that he should be despised as sluggish. For unless he shall have been insulted, it will not be
known what fortitude he has in restraining himself. Now if, when provoked by injury, he
has begun to follow up his assailant with violence, he is overcome. But if he shall have
repressed that emotion by reasoning, he altogether has command over himself: he is able
to rule himself. And this restraining1213 of oneself is rightly named patience, which single
virtue is opposed to all vices and affections. This recalls the disturbed and wavering mind
to its tranquillity; this mitigates, this restores a man to himself. Therefore, since it is impossible
and useless to resist nature, so that we are not excited at all; before, however, the
emotion bursts forth to the infliction of injury, as far1214 as is possible let it be calmed1215
in time. God has enjoined us not to let the sun go down upon our wrath,1216 lest he should
depart as a witness of our madness. Finally, Marcus Tullius, in opposition to his own precept,
concerning which I have lately spoken, gave the greatest praises to the forgetting of injuries.
“I entertain hopes,” he says, “O Cæsar, who art accustomed to forget nothing except injuries.”
1217 But if he thus acted—a man most widely removed not only from heavenly, but also
from public and civil justice—how much more ought we to do this, who are, as it were,
candidates for immortality?</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE AFFECTIONS AND THEIR USE; AND OF THE THREE FURIES.</head>
<p>When the Stoics attempt to uproot the affections from man as diseases, they are opposed
by the Peripatetics, who not only retain, but also defend them, and say that there is nothing
in man which is not produced in him with great reason and foresight. They say this indeed
rightly, if they know the true limits of each subject. Accordingly they say that this very affection
of anger is the whetstone of virtue, as though no one could fight bravely against enemies
unless he were excited by anger; by which they plainly show that they neither know what
virtue is, nor why God gave anger to man. And if this was given to us for this purpose, that
we may employ it for the slaying of men, what is to be thought more savage than man, what
more resembling the wild beasts, than that animal which God formed for communion and
innocence? There are, then, three affections which drive men headlong to all crimes: (1)
anger, (2) desire, and (3) lust.1218 On which account the poets have said that there are three
furies which harass the minds of men: anger longs for revenge, desire for riches, lust for
pleasures. But God has appointed fixed limits to all of these; and if they pass these limits
and begin to be too great, they must necessarily pervert their nature, and be changed into
diseases and vices. And it is a matter of no great labour to show what these limits are.1219
Cupidity1220 is given us for providing those things which are necessary for life; concupiscence,
1221 for the procreation of offspring; the affection of indignation,1222 for restraining
the faults of those who are in our power, that is, in order that tender age may be formed by
a severer discipline to integrity and justice: for if this time of life is not restrained by fear,1223
licence will produce boldness, and this will break out into every disgraceful and daring action.
Therefore, as it is both just and necessary to employ anger towards the young, so it is both
pernicious and impious to use it towards those of our own age. It is impious, because humanity
is injured; pernicious, because if they oppose, it is necessary either to destroy them
or to perish. But that this which I have spoken of is the reason why the affection of anger
has been given to man, may be understood from the precepts of God Himself, who commands
that we should not be angry with those who revile and injure us, but that we should always

have our hands over the young; that is, that when they err, we should correct them with
continual stripes,1224 lest by useless love and excessive indulgence they should be trained
to evil and nourished to vices. But those who are inexperienced in affairs and ignorant of
reason, have expelled those affections which have been given to man for good uses, and they
wander more widely than reason demands. From this cause they live unjustly and impiously.
They employ anger against their equals in age: hence disagreements, hence banishments,
hence wars have arisen contrary to justice. They use desire for the amassing of riches: hence
frauds, hence robberies, hence all kinds of crimes have originated. They use lust only for
the enjoyment of pleasures: hence debaucheries, hence adulteries, hence all corruptions
have proceeded. Whoever, therefore, has reduced those affections within their proper limits,
which they who are ignorant of God cannot do, he is patient, he is brave, he is just.1225</p>

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE SENSES, AND THEIR PLEASURES IN THE BRUTES AND IN
MAN; AND OF PLEASURES OF THE EYES, AND SPECTACLES.</head>
<p>It remains that I should speak against the pleasures of the five senses, and this briefly,
for the measure of the book itself now demands moderation; all of which, since they are vicious
and deadly, ought to be overcome and subdued by virtue, or, as I said a little before
respecting the affections, be recalled to their proper office. The other animals have no
pleasure, except the one only which relates to generation. Therefore they use their senses
for the necessity of their nature: they see, in order that they may seek those things which
are necessary for the preservation of life; they hear one another, and distinguish one another,
that they may be able to assemble together; they either discover from the smell, or perceive
from the taste, the things which are useful for food; they refuse and reject the things which
are useless, they measure the business of eating and drinking by the fulness of their stomach.
But the foresight of the most skilful Creator gave to man pleasure without limit, and liable
to fall into vice, because He set before him virtue, which might always be at variance with
pleasure, as with a domestic enemy. Cicero says, in the Cato Major:1226 “In truth, debaucheries,
and adulteries, and disgraceful actions are excited by no other enticements than those
of pleasure. And since nature or some God has given to man nothing more excellent than
the mind, nothing is so hostile to this divine benefit and gift as pleasure. For when lust bears
sway there is no place for temperance, nor can virtue have any existence when pleasure
reigns supreme.” But, on the other hand, God gave virtue on this account, that it might
subdue and conquer pleasure, and that, when it passed the boundaries assigned to it, it might
restrain it within the prescribed limits, lest it should soothe and captivate man with enjoyments,
render him subject to its control, and punish him with everlasting death.</p>
<p>The pleasure arising from the eyes is various and manifold, which is derived from the
sight of objects which are pleasant in intercourse with men, or in nature or workmanship.
The philosophers rightly took this away. For they say that it is much more excellent and
worthy of man to look upon the heaven1227 rather than carved works, and to admire this
most beautiful work adorned with the lights of the stars shining through,1228 as with flowers,
than to admire things painted and moulded, and varied with jewels. But when they have
eloquently exhorted us to despise earthly things, and have urged us to look up to the heaven,
nevertheless they do not despise these public spectacles. Therefore they are both delighted
with these, and are gladly present at them; though, since they are the greatest incitement to

vices, and have a most powerful tendency to corrupt our minds, they ought to be taken away
from us; for they not only contribute in no respect to a happy life, but even inflict the greatest
injury. For he who reckons it a pleasure, that a man, though justly condemned, should be
slain in his sight, pollutes his conscience as much as if he should become a spectator and a
sharer of a homicide which is secretly committed.1229 And yet they call these sports in which
human blood is shed. So far has the feeling of humanity departed from the men, that when
they destroy the lives of men, they think that they are amusing themselves with sport, being
more guilty than all those whose blood-shedding they esteem a pleasure. I ask now whether
they can be just and pious men, who, when they see men placed under the stroke of death,
and entreating mercy, not only suffer them to be put to death, but also demand it, and give
cruel and inhuman votes for their death, not being satiated with wounds nor contented with
bloodshed. Moreover, they order them, even though wounded and prostrate, to be attacked
again, and their caresses to he wasted1230 with blows, that no one may delude them by a
pretended death. They are even angry with the combatants, unless one of the two is quickly
slain; and as though they thirsted for human blood, they hate delays. They demand that
other and fresh combatants should be given to them, that they may satisfy their eyes as soon
as possible. Being imbued with this practice, they have lost their humanity. Therefore they
do not spare even the innocent, but practice upon all that which they have learned in the
slaughter of the wicked. It is not therefore befitting that those who strive to keep to the path
of justice should be companions and sharers in this public homicide. For when God forbids
us to kill, He not only prohibits us from open violence,1231 which is not even allowed by
the public laws, but He warns us against the commission of those things which are esteemed
lawful among men. Thus it will be neither lawful for a just man to engage in warfare, since
his warfare is justice itself, nor to accuse any one of a capital charge, because it makes no
difference whether you put a man to death by word, or rather by the sword, since it is the
act of putting to death itself1232 which is prohibited. Therefore, with regard to this precept
of God, there ought to be no exception at all; but that it is always unlawful to put to death
a man, whom God willed to be a sacred animal.1233</p>

<p>Therefore let no one imagine that even this is allowed, to strangle1234 newly-born children,
which is the greatest impiety; for God breathes into their souls for life, and not for
death. But men, that there may be no crime with which they may not pollute their hands,
deprive souls as yet innocent and simple of the light which they themselves have not given.
Can any one, indeed, expect that they would abstain from the blood of others who do not
abstain even from their own? But these are without any controversy wicked and unjust.
What are they whom a false piety1235 compels to expose their children? Can they be considered
innocent who expose their own offspring1236 as a prey to dogs, and as far as it depends
upon themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than if they had strangled them? Who
can doubt that he is impious who gives occasion1237 for the pity of others? For, although
that which he has wished should befall the child—namely, that it should be brought up—he
has certainly consigned his own offspring either to servitude or to the brothel? But who
does not understand, who is ignorant what things may happen, or are accustomed to happen,
in the case of each sex, even through error? For this is shown by the example of OEdipus
alone, confused with twofold guilt. It is therefore as wicked to expose as it is to kill. But truly
parricides complain of the scantiness of their means, and allege that they have not enough
for bringing up more children; as though, in truth, their means were in the power of those
who possess them, or God did not daily make the rich poor, and the poor rich. Wherefore,
if any one on account of poverty shall be unable to bring up children, it is better to abstain
from marriage1238 than with wicked hands to mar the work of God.</p>
<p>If, then, it is in no way permitted to commit homicide, it is not allowed us to be present
at all,1239 lest any bloodshed should overspread the conscience, since that blood is offered
for the gratification of the people. And I am inclined to think that the corrupting influence
of the stage is still more contaminating.1240 For the subject of comedies are the dishonouring
of virgins, or the loves of harlots; and the more eloquent they are who have composed the
accounts of these disgraceful actions, the more do they persuade by the elegance of their
<note type="footnote">blood,” etc. (Gen. ix. 6). The impunity of Cain had led to bloodshed (Gen. vi. 11), to which as a necessary remedy

sentiments; and harmonious and polished verses more readily remain fixed in the memory
of the hearers. In like manner, the stories of the tragedians place before the eyes the parricides
and incests of wicked kings, and represent tragic1241 crimes. And what other effect do the
immodest gestures of the players produce, but both teach and excite lusts? whose enervated
bodies, rendered effeminate after the gait and dress of women, imitate1242 unchaste women
by their disgraceful gestures. Why should I speak of the actors of mimes,1243 who hold forth
instruction in corrupting influences, who teach adulteries while they feign them, and by
pretended actions train to those which are true? What can young men or virgins do, when
they see that these things are practised without shame, and willingly beheld by all? They are
plainly admonished of what they can do, and are inflamed with lust, which is especially excited
by seeing; and every one according to his sex forms1244 himself in these representations.
And they approve of these things, while they laugh at them, and with vices clinging to them,
they return more corrupted to their apartments; and not boys only, who ought not to be
inured to vices prematurely, but also old men, whom it does not become at their age to sin.</p>
<p>What else does the practice of the Circensian games contain but levity, vanity, and
madness? For their souls are hurried away to mad excitement with as great impetuosity as
that with which the chariot races are there carried on; so that they who come for the sake
of beholding the spectacle now themselves exhibit more of a spectacle, when they begin to
utter exclamations, to be thrown into transports, and to leap from their seats. Therefore all
spectacles ought to be avoided, not only that no vice may settle in our breasts, which ought
to be tranquil and peaceful; but that the habitual indulgence of any pleasure may not soothe
and captivate us, and turn us aside from God and from good works.1245 For the celebrations
of the games are festivals in honour of the gods, inasmuch as they were instituted on account
of their birthdays, or the dedication of new temples. And at first the huntings, which are
called shows, were in honour of Saturnus, and the scenic games in honour of Liber, but the
Circensian in honour of Neptune. By degrees, however, the same honour began to be paid
also to the other gods, and separate games were dedicated to their names, as Sisinnius Capito
teaches in his book on the games. Therefore, if any one is present at the spectacles to which
men assemble for the sake of religion, he has departed from the worship of God, and has
betaken himself to those deities whose birthdays and festivals he has celebrated.1246</p>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF THE PLEASURES OF THE EARS, AND OF SACRED LITERATURE.</head>
<p>Pleasure of the ears is received from the sweetness of voices and strains, which indeed
is as productive of vice as that delight of the eyes of which we have spoken. For who would
not deem him luxurious and worthless who should have scenic arts at his house? But it
makes no difference whether you practice luxury alone at home, or with the people in the
theatre. But we have already spoken of spectacles:1247 there remains one thing which is to
be overcome by us, that we be not captivated by those things which penetrate to the innermost
perception. For all those things which are unconnected with words, that is, pleasant sounds
of the air and of strings, may be easily disregarded, because they do not adhere to us, and
cannot be written. But a well-composed poem, and a speech beguiling with its sweetness,
captivate the minds of men, and impel them in what direction they please. Hence, when
learned men have applied themselves to the religion of God, unless they have been instructed1248
by some skilful teacher, they do not believe. For, being accustomed to sweet and
polished speeches or poems, they despise the simple and common language of the sacred
writings as mean. For they seek that which may soothe the senses. But whatever is pleasant
to the ear effects persuasion, and while it delights fixes itself deeply within the breast. Is
God, therefore, the contriver both of the mind, and of the voice, and of the tongue, unable
to speak eloquently? Yea, rather, with the greatest foresight, He wished those things which
are divine to be without adornment, that all might understand the things which He Himself
spoke to all.</p>
<p>Therefore he who is anxious for the truth, who does not wish to deceive himself, must
lay aside hurtful and injurious pleasures, which would bind the mind to themselves, as
pleasant food does the body: true things must be preferred to false, eternal things to those
which are of short duration, useful things to those which are pleasant. Let nothing be
pleasing to the sight but that which you see to be done with piety and justice; let nothing be
agreeable to the hearing but that which nourishes the soul and makes you a better man. And
especially this sense ought not to be distorted to vice, since it is given to us for this purpose,
that we might gain the knowledge of God. Therefore, if it be a pleasure to hear melodies
and songs, let it be pleasant to sing and hear the praises of God. This is true pleasure, which
is the attendant and companion of virtue. This is not frail and brief, as those which they
desire, who, like cattle, are slaves to the body; but lasting, and affording delight without any
intermission. And if any one shall pass its limits, and shall seek nothing else from pleasure
but pleasure itself, he designs for himself death; for as there is perpetual life in virtue, so
there is death in pleasure. For he who shall choose temporal things will be without things
eternal; he who shall prefer earthly things will not have heavenly things.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF THE PLEASURES OF TASTE AND SMELL.</head>
<p>But with regard to the pleasures of taste and smell, which two senses relate only to the
body, there is nothing to be discussed by us; unless by chance any one requires us to say
that it is disgraceful to a wise and good man if he is the slave of his appetite, if he walks along
besmeared with unguents and crowned with flowers: and he who does these things is plainly
foolish and senseless, and is worthless, and one whom not even a notion of virtue has reached.
Perhaps some one will say, Why, then, have these things been made, except that we may
enjoy them? However, it has often been said that there would have been no virtue unless it
had things which it might overpower. Therefore God made all things to supply a contest
between two things. Those enticements of pleasures, then, are the instruments of that whose
only business it is to subdue virtue, and to shut out justice from men. With these soothing
influences and enjoyments it captivates their souls; for it knows that pleasure is the contriver
of death. For as God calls man to life only through virtue and labour, so the other calls us
to death by delights and pleasures; and as men arrive at real good through deceitful evils,
so they arrive at real evil through deceitful goods. Therefore those enjoyments are to be
guarded against, as snares or nets, lest, captivated by the softness of enjoyments, we should
be brought under the dominion of death with the body itself, to which we have enslaved
ourselves.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.1249—DE TACTUS VOLUPTATE ET LIBIDINE, ATQUE DE
MATRIMONIO ET CONTINENTIÂ.</head>
<p>Venio nunc ad eam, quæ percipitur ex tactu, voluptatem: qui sensus est quidem totius
corporis. Sed ego non de ornamentis, aut vestibus, sed de solâ libidine dicendum mihi puto;
quæ maxime coercenda est, quia maxime nocet. Cure excogitasset Deus duorum sexuum
rationero, attribuit iis, ut se invicem appeterent, et conjunctione gauderent. Itaque
ardentissimam cupiditatem cunctorum animantium corporibus admiscuit, ut in hos affectus
avidissime ruerent, eaque ratione propagari et multiplicari genera possent. Quæ cupiditas
et appetentia in homine vehementior et acrior invenitur; vel quia hominum multitudinem
voluit esse majorem, vel quoniam virtutem soli homini dedit, ut esset laus et gloria in
coercendis voluptatibus, et abstinentia sui. Seit ergo adversarius ille noster, quanta sit vis
hujus cupiditatis, quam quidam necessitatem dicere maluerunt; eamque a recto et bono, ad
malum et pravum transfert. Illicita enim desideria immittit, ut aliena contaminent, quibus
habere propria sine delicto licet. Objicit quippe oculis irritabiles formas, suggeritque fomenta,
et vitiis pabulum subministrat: tum intimis visceribus stimulos omnes conturbat et
commovet, et naturalem illum incitat atque inflammat ardorem, donee irretitum hominem
implicatumque decipiat. Ac ne quis esset, qui poenarum metu abstineret alieno, lupanaria
quoque constituit; et pudorem infelicium mulierum publicavit, ut ludibrio haberet tam eos
qui faciunt, quam quas pati necesse est.</p>
<p>His obscoenitatibus animas, ad sanctitatem genitas, velut in coeni gurgite demersit,
pudorem extinxit, pudicitiam profligavit. Idem etiam mares maribus admiscuit; et nefandos
coitus contra naturam contraque institutum Dei machinatus est: sic imbuit homines, et
armavit ad nefas omne. Quid enim potest esse sanctum iis, qui ætatem imbecillam et præsidio
indigentem, libidini suæ depopulandam foedandamque substraverint? Non potest hæc res
pro magnitudine sceleris enarrari. Nihil amplius istos appellare possum, quam implos et
parricidas, quibus non sufficit sexus a Deo datus, nisi eliare suum profane ac petulanter
illudant. Hæc tamen apud illos levia, et quasi honesta sunt. Quid dicam de iis, qui
abominandam non libidinem, sod insaniam potius exercent! Piget dicere: sed quid his fore
credamus, quos non piget facere? et tamen dicendum est, quia fit. De istis loquor, quorum
teterrima libido et execrabilis furor ne capiti quidem parcit. Quibus hoc verbis, aut qua
indignatione tantum nefas prosequar? Vincit officium linguæ sceleris magnitudo. Cum
igitur libido hæc edat opera, et hæc facinora designer, armandi adversus earn virtute maxima
sumus. Quisquis affectus illos frænare non potest, cohibeat eos intra præ scriptum legitimi
tori, ut et illud, quod avide expetat, consequatur, et tamen in peccatum non incidat. Nam

quid sibi homines perditi volunt? Nempe honesta opera voluptas sequitur: si ipsam per se
appetunt, justa et legitima frui licet.</p>
<p>Quod si aliqua necessitas prohibebit tum vero maxima adhibenda virtus erit, ut cupiditati
continentia reluctetur. Nec tanturn alienis, quæ attingere non licet, veriun etiam publicis
vulgatisque corporibus abstinendum, Deus præcepit; docetque nos, cum duo inter se corpora
fuerint copulata, unum corpus efficere. Ita qui se coeno immerserit, coeno sit oblitus necesse
est; et corpus quidem cito ablui potest: mens autem contagione impudici corporis inquinata
non potest, nisi et longo tempore, et multis bonis operibus, ab ea quæ inhæ serit colluvione
purgari. Oportet ergo sibi quemque proponere, duorum sexuum conjunctionem generandi
causa datam esse viventibus, eamque legera his affectibus positam, ut successionera parent.
Sicut autem dedit nobis oculos Deus, non ut spectemus, voluptatemque capiamus, sed ut
videamus propter eos actus, qui pertinent ad vitæ necessitatem, ita genitalem corporis
partem, quod nomen ipsum docet, nulla alia causa nisi efficiendæ sobolis accepimus. Huic
divinæ legi summa devotione parendum est. Sint omnes, qui se discipulos Dei profitebuntur,
ita morati et instituti, ut imperare sibi possint. Nam qui voluptatibus indulgent, qui libidini
obsequuntur, ii animam suam corpori mancipant, ad mortemque condemnant: quia se
corpori addixerunt, in quod habet mors potestatem. Unusquisque igitur, quantum potest,
formet se ad verecundiam, pudorem colat, castitatem conscientia et mente tueatur; nec
tantum legibus publicis pareat: sed sit supra omnes leges, qui legem Dei sequitur. Quibus
bonis si assueverit, jam pudebit eum ad deteriora desciscere: modo placeant recta et honesta,
quæ melioribus jucundiora sunt quam prava et inhonesta pejoribus.</p>
<p>Nondum omnia castitatis officio exsecutus sum: quam Deus fion modo intra privatos
parietes, sed etiam præ scripto lectuli terminat; ut cum quis hobeat uxorem, neque servam,
neque liberam habere insuper velit, sed matrimonio fidem server. Non enim, sicut juris
publici ratio est, solo mulier adultera est, quæ habet allure, maritus outem, etiam si plures
habeat, a crimine adulterii solutus est. Sed divina lex ira duos in matrimonium, quod est in
corpus unum, pari jure conjungit, ut adulter habeatur, quisquis compagem corporis in
diversa distraxerit. Nec ob aliam cansam Deus, cam cæteras animantes suscepto foetu maribus
repugnare voluisset, solam omnium mulierem patientem viri fecit; scilicet ne foeminis
repugnantibus, libido cogeret viros aliud appetere, eoque facto, castitatis gloriam non
tenerent.1250 Sed neque mulier virtutem pudicitiæ caperet, si peccare non posset. Nam quis
mutum animal pudicum esse dixerit, quod suscepto foe tu mari repugnat? Quod ideo facit,
quia necesse est in dolorem atque in periculum veniat, si admiserit. Nulla igitur laus est,
non facere quod facere non possis. Ideo autem pudicitia in homine laudatur, quia non
naturalis est, sed voluntaria. Servanda igitur fides ab utroque alteri est: immo exemplo

Hæc sunt quæ ad continentiam præ cipiuntur a Deo. Sed tamen ne quis divina præ cepta
circumscribere se putet posse, adduntur ilia, ut omnis calumnia, et occasio fraudis
removeatur, adulterum esse, qui a marito dimissam duxerit, et eum qui præ tercrimen
adulterii uxorem dimiserit, ut alteram ducat; dissociari enim corpus et distrahi Deus noluit.
Præ terea non tanturn adulterium esse vitandum, sed etiam cogitationem; ne quis aspiciat
alienam, et animo concupiscat: adulteram enim fieri mentem, si vel imaginem voluptatis
sibi ipsa depinxerit. Mens est enim profecto quæ peccat; quæ immoderata: libidinis fructum
cogitatione complectitur; in hac crimen est, in hac omne delictum. Nam etsi corpus nulla

<head>CHAP. XXIV.—OF REPENTANCE, OF PARDON, AND THE COMMANDS OF GOD.</head>
<p>Nor, however, let any one be disheartened, or despair concerning himself, if, overcome
by passion, or impelled by desire, or deceived by error, or compelled by force, he has turned
aside to the way of unrighteousness. For it is possible for him to be brought back, and to be
set free, if he repents of his actions, and, turning to better things, makes satisfaction to God.
Cicero, indeed, thought that this was impossible, whose words in the third book of the
Academics1251 are: “But if, as in the case of those who have gone astray on a journey, it were
permitted those who have followed a devious course to correct their error by repentance,
it would be more easy to amend rashness.” It is altogether permitted them. For if we think
that our children are corrected when we perceive that they repent of their faults, and though
we have disinherited and cast them off, we again receive, cherish, and embrace them, why
should we despair that the mercy of God our Father may again be appeased by repentance?
Therefore He who is at once the Lord and most indulgent Parent promises that He will remit
the sins of the penitent, and that He will blot out all the iniquities of him who shall begin
afresh to practice righteousness. For as the uprightness of his past life is of no avail to him
who lives badly, because the subsequent wickedness has destroyed his works of righteousness,
so former sins do not stand in the way of him who has amended his life, because the subsequent
righteousness has effaced the stain of his former life. For he who repents of that
which he has done, understands his former error; and on this account the Greeks better and
more significantly speak of metanoia,1252 which we may speak of in Latin as a return to a
right understanding.1253 For he returns to a right understanding, and recovers his mind as
it were from madness, who is grieved for his error; and he reproves himself of madness, and
confirms his mind to a better course of life: then he especially guards against this very thing,
that he may not again be led into the same snares. In short, even the dumb animals, when
they are ensnared by fraud, if by any means they have extricated themselves so as to escape,
become more cautious for the future, and always avoid all those things in which they have
perceived wiles and snares. Thus repentance makes a man cautious and diligent to avoid
the faults into which he has once fallen through deceit.</p>
<p>For no one can be so prudent and so circumspect as not at some time to slip; and
therefore God, knowing our weakness, of His compassion1254 has opened a harbour of
refuge for man, that the medicine of repentance might aid this necessity to which our frailty

is liable.1255 Therefore, if any one has erred, let him retrace his step, and as soon as possible
recover and reform himself.
<lg>
<l>“But upward to retrace the way,</l>
<l>And pass into the light of day,</l>
<l>Then comes the stress of labour.”1256</l>
</lg>
For when men have tasted sweet pleasures to their destruction,1257 they can scarcely be
separated from them: they would more easily follow right things if they had not tasted their
attractions. But if they tear themselves away from this pernicious slavery, all their error will
be forgiven them, if they shall have corrected their error by a better life. And let not any one
imagine that he is a gainer if he shall have no witness of his fault: for all things are known
to Him in whose sight we live; and if we are able to conceal anything from all men, we cannot
conceal it from God, to whom nothing can be hidden, nothing secret. Seneca closed his exhortations
with an admirable sentiment: “There is,” he says, “some great deity, and greater
than can be imagined; and for him we endeavour to live. Let us approve ourselves to him.
For it is of no avail that conscience is confirmed; we lie open to the sight of God.” What can
be spoken with greater truth by him who knew God, than has been said by a man who is
ignorant of true religion? For he both expressed the majesty of God, by saying that it is too
great for the reflecting powers of the human mind to receive; and he touched upon the very
fountain of truth, by perceiving that the life of men is not superfluous,1258 as the Epicureans
will have it, but that they make it their endeavour to live to God, if indeed they live with
justice and piety. He might have been a true worshipper of God, if any one had pointed out
to him God;1259 and he might assuredly have despised Zeno, and his teacher Sotion, if he
had obtained a true guide of wisdom. Let us approve ourselves to him, he says. A speech
truly heavenly, had it not been preceded by a confession of ignorance. It is of no avail that
conscience is confined; we lie open to the sight of God. There is then no room for falsehood,
none for dissimulation; for the eyes of men are removed by walls, but the divine power of

God cannot be removed by the inward parts from looking through and knowing the entire
man. The same writer says, in the first book of the same work: “What are you doing? what
are you contriving? what are you hiding? Your guardian follows you; one is withdrawn from
you by foreign travel, another by death, another by infirm health; this one adheres to you,
and you can never be without him. Why do you choose a secret place, and remove the witness?
Suppose that you have succeeded in escaping the notice of all, foolish man! What does
it profit you not to have a witness,1260 if you have the witness of your own conscience?</p>
<p>And Tully speaks in a manner no less remarkable concerning conscience and God: “Let
him remember,” he says, “that he has God as a witness, that is, as I judge, his own mind,
than which God has given nothing more divine to man.”1261 Likewise, in speaking of the
just and good man, he says: “Therefore such a man will not dare not merely to do, but even
to think, anything which he would not dare to proclaim.” Therefore let us cleanse our conscience,
which is open to the eyes of God; and, as the same writer says, “let us always so live
as to remember that we shall have to give an account;”1262 and let us reckon that we are
looked upon at every moment, not, as he said, in some theatre of the world by men, but
from above by Him who is about to be both the judge and also the witness, to whom, when
He demands an account of our life, it will not be permitted any one to deny his actions.
Therefore it is better either to flee from conscience, or ourselves to open our mind of our
own accord, and tearing open our wounds to pour forth destruction; which wounds no one
else can heal but He alone who made the lame to walk, restored sight to the blind, cleansed
the polluted limbs, and raised the dead. He will quench the ardour of desires, He will root
out lusts, He will remove envy, He will mitigate anger. He will give true and lasting health.
This remedy should be sought by all, inasmuch as the soul is harassed by greater danger
than the body, and a cure should be applied as soon as possible to secret diseases. For if any
one has his eyesight clear, all his limbs perfect, and his entire body in the most vigorous
health, nevertheless I should not call him sound if he is carried away by anger, swollen and
puffed up with pride, the slave of lust, and burning with desires; but I should rather call him
sound who does not raise his eyes to the prosperity of another, who does not admire riches,
who looks upon another’s wife with chaste eye, who covets nothing at all, does not desire
that which is another’s, envies no one, disdains no one; who is lowly, merciful, bountiful,
mild, courteous: peace perpetually dwells in his mind.</p>
<p>That man is sound, he is just, he is perfect. Whoever, therefore, has obeyed all these
heavenly precepts, he is a worshipper of the true God, whose sacrifices are gentleness of
spirit, and an innocent life, and good actions. And he who exhibits all these qualities offers

<pb n="425"/>
a sacrifice as often as he performs any good and pious action. For God does not desire the
sacrifice of a dumb animal, nor of death and blood, but of man and life. And to this sacrifice
there is neither need of sacred boughs, nor of purifications,1263 nor of sods of turf, which
things are plainly most vain, but of those things which are put forth from the innermost
breast. Therefore, upon the altar of God, which is truly very great,1264 and which is placed
in the heart of man, and cannot be defiled with blood, there is placed righteousness, patience,
faith, innocence, chastity, and abstinence. This is the truest ceremony, this is that law of
God, as it is called by Cicero, illustrious and divine, which always commands things which
are right and honourable, and forbids things which are wrong and disgraceful; and he who
obeys this most holy and certain law cannot fail to live justly and lawfully. And I have laid
down a few chief points of this law, since I promised that I would speak only of those things
which completed the character1265 of virtue and righteousness. If any one shall wish to
comprise all the other parts, let him seek them from the fountain itself, from which that
stream flowed to us.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXV.—OF SACRIFICE, AND OF AN OFFERING WORTHY OF GOD, AND
OF THE FORM OF PRAISING GOD.</head>
<p>Now let us speak briefly concerning sacrifice itself. “Ivory,” says Plato, “is not a pure
offering to God.” What then? Are embroidered and costly textures? Nay, rather nothing is
a pure offering to God which can be corrupted or taken away secretly. But as he saw this,
that nothing which was taken from a dead body ought to be offered to a living being, why
did he not see that a corporeal offering ought not to be presented to an incorporeal being?
How much better and more truly does Seneca speak: “Will you think of God as great and
placid, and a friend to be reverenced with gentle majesty, and always at hand? not to be
worshipped with the immolation of victims and with much blood—for what pleasure arises
from the slaughter of innocent animals?—but with a pure mind and with a good and honourable
purpose. Temples are not to be built to Him with stones piled up on high; He is to
be consecrated by each man in his own breast.” Therefore, if any one thinks that garments,
and jewels, and other things which are esteemed precious, are valued by God, he is altogether
ignorant of what God is, since he thinks that those things are pleasing to Him which even
a man would be justly praised for despising. What, then, is pure, what is worthy of God, but
that which He Himself has demanded in that divine law of His?</p>
<p>There are two things which ought to be offered, the gift1266 and the sacrifice; the gift as
a perpetual offering, the sacrifice for a time. But with those who by no means understand
the nature of the Divine Being, a gift is anything which is wrought of gold or silver; likewise
anything which is woven of purple and silk: a sacrifice is a victim, and as many things as are
burnt upon the altar. But God does not make use either of the one or the other, because He
is free from corruption, and that is altogether corruptible. Therefore, in each case, that which
is incorporeal must be offered to God, for He accepts this. His offering is innocency of soul;
His sacrifice praise and a hymn.1267 For if God is not seen, He ought therefore to be worshipped
with things which are not seen. Therefore no other religion is true but that which
consists of virtue and justice. But in what manner God deals with the justice of man is easily
understood. For if man shall be just, having received immortality, he will serve God for ever.
But that men are not born except for justice, both the ancient philosophers and even Cicero
suspects. For, discussing the Laws,1268 he says: “But of all things which are discussed by
learned men, nothing assuredly is of greater importance than that it should be entirely understood
that we are born to justice.” We ought therefore to hold forth and offer to God
that alone for the receiving of which He Himself produced us. But how true this twofold
kind of sacrifice is, Trismegistus Hermes is a befitting witness, who agrees with us, that is,
<note type="footnote">1266 Donum, a free-will offering or gift. See Ex. xxv. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1267 [i.e., “the Eucharist” as a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. And mark what follows, note 3, infra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1268 [Nos ad justitiam esse natos.]</note>

<pb n="427"/>
with the prophets, whom we follow, as much in fact as in words. He thus spoke concerning
justice: “Adore and worship this word, O son.” But the worship of God consists of one thing,
not to be wicked. Also in that perfect discourse, when he heard Asclepius inquiring from
his son whether it pleased him that incense and other odours for divine sacrifice were offered
to his father, exclaimed: “Speak words of good omen, O Asclepius. For it is the greatest impiety
to entertain any such thought concerning that being of pre-eminent goodness. For
these things, and things resembling these, are not adapted to Him. For He is full of all things,
as many as exist, and He has need of nothing at all. But let us give Him thanks, and adore
Him. For His sacrifice consists only of blessing.” And he spoke rightly.1269</p>
<p>For we ought to sacrifice to God in word; inasmuch as God is the Word, as He Himself
confessed. Therefore the chief ceremonial in the worship of God is praise from the mouth
of a just man directed towards God.1270 That this, however, may be accepted by God, there
is need of humility, and fear, and devotion in the greatest degree, lest any one should chance
to place confidence in his integrity and innocence, and thus incur the charge of pride and
arrogance, and by this deed lose the recompense of his virtue. But that he may obtain the
favour of God, and be free from every stain, let him always implore the mercy of God, and
pray for nothing else but pardon for his sins, even though he has none.1271 If he desires
anything else, there is no need of expressing it in word to one who knows what we wish; if
anything good shall happen to him, let him give thanks; if any evil, let him make amends,1272
and let him confess that the evil has happened to him on account of his faults; and even in
evils let him nothing less give thanks, and make amends in good things, that he may be the
same at all times, and be firm, and unchangeable, and unshaken. And let him not suppose
that this is to be done by him only in the temple, but at home, and even in his very bed. In
short, let him always have God with himself, consecrated in his heart, inasmuch as he himself
is a temple of God. But if he has served God, his Father and Lord, with this assiduity, obedience,
and devotion, justice is complete and perfect; and he who shall keep this, as we before
testified, has obeyed God, and has satisfied the obligations of religion and his own duty.</p>

<head>CHAP. I.—OF THE WORLD, AND THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO BELIEVE, AND
THOSE WHO ARE NOT; AND IN THIS THE CENSURE OF THE FAITHLESS.</head>
<p>It is well: the foundations are laid, as the illustrious orator says. But we have not only
laid the foundations, which might be firm and suitable for the support of the work; but we
have raised the entire edifice, with great and strong buildings, almost to the summit. There
remains, a matter which is much easier, either to cover or adorn it; without which, however,
the former works are both useless and displeasing. For of what avail is it, either to be freed
from false religions1273 or to understand the true1274 one? Of what avail, either to see the
vanity of false wisdom,1275 or to know what is true?1276 Of what avail is it, I say, to defend
that heavenly justice?1277 Of what avail to hold the worship of God1278 with great difficulties,
which is the greatest virtue, unless the divine reward of everlasting blessedness attends it?
Of which subject we must speak in this book, lest all that is gone before should appear vain
and unprofitable: if we should leave this, on account of which they were undertaken, in
uncertainty, lest any one should by chance think that such great labours are undertaken in
vain; while he distrusts their heavenly reward, which God has appointed for him who shall
have despised the present sweet enjoyments of earth in comparison of solitary and unrewarded1279
virtue. Let us satisfy this part of our subject also, both by the testimonies of the
sacred writings and also by probable arguments, that it may be equally manifest that future
things are to be preferred to those which are present; heavenly things to earthly; and eternal
things to those which are temporal: since the rewards of vices are temporal, those of virtues
are eternal.</p>
<p>I will therefore set forth the system of the world, that it may easily be understood both
when and how it was made by God; which Plato, who discoursed about the making of the
world, could neither know nor explain, inasmuch as he was ignorant of the heavenly mystery,
which is not learned except by the teaching of prophets and God; and therefore he said that
it was created for eternity. Whereas the case is far different, since whatever is of a solid and
heavy body, as it received a beginning at some time, so it must needs have an end. For
Aristotle, when he did not see how so great a magnitude of things could perish, and wished
to escape this objection,1280 said that the world always had existed, and always would exist.

<pb n="430"/>
He did not at all see, that whatever material thing exists must at some time have had a beginning,
and that nothing can exist at all unless it had a beginning. For when we see that
earth, and water, and fire perish, are consumed, and extinguished, which are clearly parts
of the world, it is understood that that is altogether mortal the members of which are mortal.
Thus it comes to pass, that whatever is liable to destruction must have been produced. But
everything which comes within the sight of the eyes must of necessity be material, and
capable of dissolution. Therefore Epicurus alone, following the authority of Democritus,
spoke truly in this matter, who said that it had a beginning at some time, and that it would
at some time perish. Nor, however, was he able to assign any reason, either through what
causes or at what time this work of such magnitude should be destroyed. But since God has
revealed this to us, and we do not arrive at it by conjectures, but by instruction from heaven,
we will carefully teach it, that it may at length be evident to those who are desirous of the
truth, that the philosophers did not see nor comprehend the truth; but that they had so
slight a knowledge1281 of it, that they by no means perceived from what source that fragrance1282
of wisdom, which was so pleasant and agreeable, breathed upon them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think it necessary to admonish those who are about to read this, that
depraved and vicious minds, since the acuteness of their mind is blunted by earthly passions,
which weigh down all the perceptions and render them weak, will either altogether fail to
understand these things which we relate, or, even if they shall understand them, they will
dissemble and be unwilling for them to be true: because they are drawn away by vices, and
they knowingly favour their own evils, by the pleasantness of which they are captivated, and
they desert the way of virtue, by the bitterness of which they are offended. For they who are
inflamed with avarice and a certain insatiable thirst for riches—because, when they have
sold or squandered the things in which they delight, they are unable to live in a simple
style—undoubtedly prefer that by which they are compelled to renounce their eager desires.
Also, they who, urged on by the incitements of lusts, as the poet says,1283
<lg>
<l>“Rush into madness and fire,”</l>
</lg>
say that we bring forward things plainly incredible; because the precepts about self-restraint
wound their ears, which restrain them from their pleasures, to which they have given1284
up their soul, together with their body. But those who, swollen with ambition or inflamed
with the love of power, have bestowed all their efforts on the acquisition of honours, will
not, even if we should bear the sun himself in our hands, believe that teaching which com-

<pb n="431"/>
mands them to despise all power and honour, and to live in humility, and in such humility
that they may be able to receive an injury, and if they have received one, be unwilling to return
it. These are the men who cry out1285 in any way against the truth with closed eyes. But they
who are or shall be of sound mind, that is, not so immersed in vices as to be incurable, will
both believe these things, and will readily approach them; and whatever things we say, they
will appear to them open, and plain, and simple, and that which is chiefly necessary, true
and unassailable.</p>
<p>No one favours virtue but he who is able to follow it; but it is not easy for all to follow
it: they can do so whom poverty and want have exercised, and made capable of virtue. For
if the endurance of evils is virtue, it follows that they are not capable of virtue who have always
lived in the enjoyment of good things; because they have never experienced evils, nor can
they endure them, through their long-continued use and desire of good things, which alone
they know. Thus it comes to pass that the poor and humble, who are unencumbered, more
readily believe God than the rich, who are entangled with many hindrances;1286 yea, rather,
in chains and fetters they are enslaved to the nod of desire, their mistress, which has ensnared
them with inextricable bonds; nor are they able to look up to heaven, since their mind is
bent down to the earth, and fixed on the ground. But the way of virtue does not admit those
carrying great burthens. The path is very narrow by which justice leads man to heaven; no
one can keep this unless he is unencumbered and lightly equipped. For those wealthy men,
who are loaded with many and great burthens, proceed along the way of death, which is
very broad, since destruction rules with extended sway. The precepts which God gives for
justice, and the things which we bring forward under the teaching of God respecting virtue
and the truth, are bitter and as poisons to these. And if they shall dare to oppose these things,
they must own themselves to be enemies of virtue and justice. I will now come to the remaining
part of the subject, that an end may be put to the work. But this remains, that we should
treat of the judgment of God, which will then be established when our Lord shall return to
the earth to render to every one either a reward or punishment, according to his desert.
Therefore, as we spoke in the fourth book concerning His first advent,1287 so in this book
we will relate His second advent, which the Jews also both confess and hope for; but in vain,
since He must return to the confusion1288 of those for whose call He had before come. For
they who impiously treated Him with violence in His humiliation, will experience Him in
His power as a conqueror; and, God requiting them, they will suffer all those things which
they read and do not understand; inasmuch as, being polluted with all sins, and moreover

<p>Now let us instruct those who are ignorant of the truth. It has been so determined by
the arrangement of the Most High God, that this unrighteous age, having run the course1289
of its appointed times, should come to an end; and all wickedness being immediately extinguished,
and the souls of the righteous being recalled to a happy life, a quiet, tranquil,
peaceful, in short, golden age, as the poets call it, should flourish, under the rule of God
Himself. This was especially the cause of all the errors of the philosophers, that they did not
comprehend the system of the world, which comprises the whole of wisdom. But it cannot
be comprehended by our own perception and innate intelligence, which they wished to do
by themselves without a teacher. Therefore they fell into various and ofttimes contradictory
opinions, out of which they had no way of escape,
<lg>
<l>And they remained fixed in the same mire,</l>
</lg>
as the comic writer1290 says, since their conclusion does not correspond with their assumptions;
1291 inasmuch as they had assumed things to be true which could not be affirmed, and
proved without the knowledge of the truth and of heavenly things. And this knowledge, as
I have often said already, cannot exist in a man unless it is derived from the teaching of God.
For if a man is able to understand divine things, he will be able also to perform them; for to
understand is, as it were, to follow in their track. But he is not able to do the things which
God does, because he is clothed with a mortal body; therefore he cannot even understand
those things which God does. And whether this is possible is easy for every one to measure,
from the immensity of the divine actions and works. For if you will contemplate the world,
with all the things which it contains, you will assuredly understand how much the work of
God surpasses the works of men. Thus, as great as is the difference between divine and human
works, so great must be the distance between the wisdom of God and man. For because God
is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore perfect because He is everlasting, His wisdom
also is perfect, as He Himself is; nor can anything oppose it, because God Himself is subject
to nothing.</p>
<p>But because man is subject to passion, his wisdom also is subject to error; and as many
things hinder the life of man, so that it cannot be perpetual, so also his wisdom must be
hindered by many things: so that it is not perfect in entirely perceiving the truth. Therefore
there is no human wisdom, if it strives by itself to attain to the conception and knowledge

<note type="footnote">1291 Assumptio: often used for the minor proposition in a syllogism.</note>

<pb n="434"/>
of the truth; inasmuch as the mind of man, being bound up with a frail body, and enclosed
in a dark abode, is neither able to wander at large, nor clearly to perceive the truth, the
knowledge of which belongs to the divine nature. For His works are known to God alone.
But man cannot attain this knowledge by reflection or disputation, but by learning and
hearing from Him who alone is able to know and to teach. Therefore Marcus Tullius,1292
borrowing from Plato the sentiment of Socrates, who said that the time had come for himself
to depart from life, but that they before whom he was pleading his cause were still alive,
says: Which is better is known to the immortal gods; but I think that no man knows.
Wherefore all the sects of philosophers must be far removed from the truth, because they
who established them were men; nor can those things have any foundation or firmness
which are unsupported by any utterances of divine voices.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—OF NATURE, AND OF THE WORLD; AND A CENSURE OF THE STOICS
AND EPICUREANS.</head>
<p>And since we are speaking of the errors of philosophers, the Stoics divide nature into
two parts—the one which effects, the other which affords itself tractable for action. They
say that in the former is contained all the power of perception, in the latter the material,
and that the one cannot act without the other. How can that which handles and that which
is handled be one and the same thing? If any one should say that the potter is the same as
the clay, or that the clay is the same as the potter, would he not plainly appear to be mad?
But these men comprehend under the one name of nature two things which are most widely
different, God and the world, the Maker and the work; and say that the one can do nothing
without the other, as though God were mixed up in nature with the world. For sometimes
they so mix them together, that God Himself is the mind of the world, and that the world
is the body of God; as though the world and God began to exist at the same time, and God
did not Himself make the world. And they themselves also confess this at other times, when
they say that it was made for the sake of men, and that God could, if He willed it, exist
without the world, inasmuch as God is the divine and eternal mind, separate and free from
a body. And since they were unable to understand His power and majesty, they mixed
Him1293 with the world, that is, with His own work. Whence is that saying of Virgil:1294—
<lg>
<l>“A spirit whose celestial flame</l>
<l>Glows in each member of the frame,</l>
<l>And stirs the mighty whole.”</l>
</lg>
What, then, becomes of their own saying, that the world was both made and is governed by
the divine providence? For if He made the world, it follows that He existed without the
world; if He governs it, it is plain that it is not as the mind governs the body, but as a master
rules the house, as a pilot the ship, as a charioteer the chariot. Nor, however, are they mixed
with those things which they govern. For if all these things which we see are members of
God, then God is rendered insensible by them, since the members are without sensibility,
and mortal, since we see that the members are mortal.</p>
<p>I can enumerate how often lands shaken by sudden motions1295 have either opened or
sunk down precipitously; how often cities and islands have been overwhelmed by waves,
and gone into the deep; marshes have inundated fruitful plains, rivers and pools have been
<note type="footnote">1293 Eum. Others read “eam,” referring it to “majestatem.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1294 Æneid, vi. 726.</note>
<note type="footnote">1295 i.e., earthquakes.</note>

<pb n="436"/>
dried up;1296 mountains also have either fallen precipitously, or have been levelled with
plains. Many districts, and the foundations of many mountains, are laid waste by latent and
internal fire. And this is not enough, if God does not spare His own members, unless it is
permitted man also to have some power over the body of God. Seas are built up, mountains
are cut down, and the innermost bowels of the earth are dug out to draw forth riches. Why,
should I say that we cannot even plough without lacerating the divine body? So that we are
at once wicked and impious in doing violence to the members of God. Does God, then,
suffer His body to be harassed, and endure to weaken Himself, or permit this to be done by
man? Unless by chance that divine intelligence which is mixed with the world, and with all
parts of the world, abandoned the first outer aspect1297 of the earth, and plunged itself into
the lowest depths, that it might be sensible of no pain from continual laceration. But if this
is trifling and absurd, then they themselves were as devoid of intelligence as those are who
have not perceived that the divine spirit is everywhere diffused, and that all things are held
together by it, not however in such a manner that God, who is incorruptible, should Himself
be mixed with heavy and corruptible elements. Therefore that is more correct which they
derived from Plato, that the world was made by God, and is also governed by His providence.
It was therefore befitting that Plato, and those who held the same opinion, should teach and
explain what was the cause, what the reason, for the contriving of so great a work; why or
for the sake of whom He made it.</p>
<p>But the Stoics also say the world was made for the sake of men. I hear. But Epicurus is
ignorant on what account or who made men themselves. For Lucretius, when he said that
the world was not made by the gods, thus spoke:1298
<lg>
<l>“To say, again, that for the sake of men they have willed to set in order the glorious
nature of the world”—</l>
</lg>
then he introduced:—
<lg>
<l>“Is sheer folly. For what advantage can our gratitude bestow on immortal and
blessed beings, that for our, sake they should take in hand to administer aught?”</l>
</lg>
And with good reason. For they brought forward no reason why the human race was created
or established by God. It is our business to set forth the mystery of the world and man, of
which they, being destitute, were able neither to reach nor see the shrine of truth. Therefore,

<pb n="437"/>
as I said a little before, when they had assumed that which was true, that is, that the world
was made by God, and was made for the sake of men, yet, since their argument failed them
in the consequences, they were unable to defend that which they had assumed. In fine, Plato,
that he might not make the work of God weak and subject to ruin, said that it would remain
for ever. If it was made for the sake of men, and so made as to be eternal, why then are not
they on whose account it was made eternal? If they are mortal on account of whom it was
made, it must also itself be mortal and subject to dissolution, for it is not of more value than
those for whose sake it was made. But if his argument1299 were consistent, he would understand
that it must perish because it was made, and that nothing can remain for ever except
that which cannot be touched.</p>
<p>But he who says that it was not made for the sake of men has no argument. For if he
says that the Creator contrived these works of such magnitude on His own account, why
then were we produced? Why do we enjoy the world itself? what means the creation of the
human race, and of the other living creatures? why do we intercept the advantages of others?
why, in short, do we grow, decrease, and perish? What reason is implied in our production
itself? what in our perpetual succession? Doubtless God wished us to be seen, and to frame,
as it were, impressions1300 with various representations of Himself, with which He might
delight Himself. Nevertheless, if it were so, He would esteem living creatures as His care,
and especially man, to whose command He made all things subject. But with regard to those
who say that the world always existed: I omit that point, that itself cannot exist without some
beginning, from which they are unable to extricate themselves; but I say this, if the world
always existed, it can have no systematic arrangement.1301 For what could arrangement
have effected in that which never had a beginning? For before anything is done or arranged,
there is need of counsel that it may be determined how it should be done; nor can anything
be done without the foresight of a settled plan. Therefore the plan precedes every work.
Therefore that which has not been made has no plan. But the world has a plan by which it
both exists and is governed; therefore also it was made: if it was made, it will also be destroyed.
Let them therefore assign a reason, if they can, why it was either made in the beginning or
will hereafter be destroyed.</p>
<p>And because Epicurus or Democritus was unable to teach this, he said that it was produced
of its own accord, the seeds1302 coming together in all directions; and that when these
are again resolved, discord and destruction will follow. Therefore he perverted1303 that

<note type="footnote">1300 Little images, sigilla.</note>
<note type="footnote">1301 Rationem.</note>
<note type="footnote">1302 i.e., atoms.</note>
<note type="footnote">1303 Corrupit.</note>

<pb n="438"/>
which he had correctly seen, and by his ignorance of system entirely overthrew the whole
system, and reduced the world, and all things which are done in it, to the likeness of a most
trifling dream, if no plan exists in human affairs. But since the world and all its parts, as we
see, are governed by a wonderful plan; since the framing of the heaven, and the course of
the stars and of the heavenly bodies, which is harmonious1304 even in variety itself, the
constant and wonderful arrangement of the seasons, the varied fruitfulness of the lands, the
level plains, the defences and heapings up of mountains, the verdure and productiveness of
the woods, the most salubrious bursting forth of fountains, the seasonable overflowings of
rivers, the rich and abundant flowing1305 in of the sea, the opposite and useful breathing1306
of the winds, and all things, are fixed with the greatest regularity: who is so blind as to think
that they were made without a cause, in which a wonderful disposition of most provident
arrangement shines forth? If, therefore, nothing at all exists nor is done without a cause; if
the providence of the Supreme God is manifest from the disposition of things, His excellency
from their greatness, and His power from their government: therefore they are dull and
mad who have said that there is no providence. I should not disapprove if they denied the
existence of gods with this object, that they might affirm the existence of one; but when they
did it with this intent, that they might say that there is none, he who does not think that
they were senseless is himself senseless.</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—THAT ALL THINGS WERE CREATED FOR SOME USE, EVEN THOSE
THINGS WHICH APPEAR EVIL; ON WHAT ACCOUNT MAN ENJOYS REASON IN
SO FRAIL A BODY.</head>
<p>But we have spoken sufficiently on the subject of providence in the first book. For if it
has any existence, as appears from the wonderful nature of its works, it must be that the
same providence created man and the other animals. Let us therefore see what reason there
was for the creation of the human race, since it is evident, as the Stoics say, that the world
was made for the sake of men, although they make no slight error in this very matter, in
saying it was not made for the sake of man, but of men. For the naming of one individual
comprehends the whole human race. But this arises from the fact that they are ignorant that
one man only was made by God, and they think that men were produced in all lands and
fields like mushrooms. But Hermes was not ignorant that man was both made by God and
after the likeness of God. But I return to my subject. There is nothing, as I imagine, which
was made on its own account; but whatever is made at all must necessarily be made for some
purpose. For who is there either so senseless or so unconcerned as to attempt to do anything
at random, from which he expects no utility, no advantage? He who builds a house does
not build it merely for this purpose, that it may be a house, but that it may be inhabited. He
who builds a ship does not bestow his labour on this account, only that the ship may be
visible, but that men may sail in it. Likewise he who designs and forms any vessel does not
do it on this account, that he may only appear to have done it, but that the vessel when made
may contain something necessary for use. In like manner, other things, whatever are made,
are plainly not made superfluously, but for some useful purposes.</p>
<p>It is plain, therefore, that the world was made by God, not on account of the world itself;
for since it is without sensibility, it neither needs the warmth of the sun, or light, or the
breath of the winds, or the moisture of showers, or the nourishment of fruits. But it cannot
even be said that God made the world for His own sake, since He can exist without the
world, as He did before it was made; and God Himself does not make use of all those things
which are contained in it, and which are produced. It is evident, therefore, that the world
was constructed for the sake of living beings, since living beings enjoy those things of which
it consists; and that these may live and exist, all things necessary for them are supplied at
fixed times. Again, that the other living beings were made for the sake of man, is plain from
this, that they are subservient to man, and were given for his protection and service; since,
whether they are of the earth or of the water, they do not perceive the system of the world
as man does. We must here reply to the philosophers, and especially to Cicero, who says:
“Why should God, when He made all things on our account, make so large a quantity of
snakes and vipers? why should He scatter so many pernicious things by land and by sea?”
A very wide subject for discussion, but it must be briefly touched upon, as in passing. Since
man is formed of different and opposing elements, soul and body, that is, heaven and earth,

<pb n="440"/>
that which is slight and that which is perceptible to the senses, that which is eternal and that
which is temporal, that which has sensibility and that which is senseless, that which is endued
with light and that which is dark, reason itself and necessity require that both good and evil
things should be set before man—good things which he may use, and evil things which he
may guard against and avoid.</p>
<p>For wisdom has been given to him on this account, that, knowing the nature of good
and evil things, he may exercise the force of his reason in seeking the good and avoiding
the evil. For because wisdom was not given to the other animals, they were both defended
with natural clothing and were armed; but in the place of all these He gave to man that
which was most excellent, reason only. Therefore He formed him naked and unarmed, that
wisdom might be both his defence and covering. He placed his defence and ornament not
without, but within not in the body, but in the heart. Unless, therefore, there were evils
which he might guard against, and which he might distinguish from good and useful things,
wisdom was not necessary for him. Therefore let Marcus Tullius know that reason was either
given to man that he might take fishes on account of his own use, and avoid snakes and vipers
for the sake of his own safety; or that good and evil things were set before him on this account,
because he had received wisdom, the whole force of which is occupied in distinguishing
things good and evil.1307 Great, therefore, and right, and admirable is the force, and reason,
and power of man, for whose sake God made the world itself and all things, as many as exist,
and gave him so much honour that He set him over all things, since he alone could admire
the works of God. Most excellently, therefore, does our Asclepiades,1308 in discussing the
providence of the Supreme God in that book which he wrote to me, say: “And on this account
any one may with good reason think that the divine providence gave the place nearest to
itself to him who was able to understand its arrangement. For that is the sun: who so beholds
it as to understand why it is the sun, and what amount of influence it has upon the other
parts of the system? this is the heaven, who looks up to it? this is the earth, who inhabits it?
this is the sea, who sails upon it? this is fire, who makes use of it?” Therefore the Supreme
God did not arrange these things on account of Himself, because He stands in need of
nothing, but on account of man, who might fitly make use of them.</p>

<pb n="441"/>
<head>CHAP. V.—OF THE CREATION OF MAN, AND OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE
WORLD, AND OF THE CHIEF GOOD.</head>
<p>Let us now assign the reason why He made man himself. For if the philosophers had
known this, they would either have maintained those things which they had found to be
true, or would not have fallen into the greatest errors. For this is the chief thing; this is the
point on which everything turns. And if any one does not possess this, the truth altogether
glides away from him. It is this, in short, which causes them to be inconsistent with reason;
1309 for if this had shone upon them, if they had known all the mystery1310 of man, the
Academy would never have been in entire opposition1311 to their disputations, and to all
philosophy. As, therefore, God did not make the world for His own sake, because He does
not stand in need of its advantages, but for the sake of man, who has the use of it, so also
He made man himself for His own sake. What advantage is there to God in man, says
Epicurus, that He should make him for His own sake? Truly, that there might be one who
might understand His works; who might be able both to admire with his understanding,
and to express with his voice, the foresight displayed in their arrangement, the order of their
creation, the power exerted in their completion. And the sum of all these things is, that he
should worship God.1312 For he who understands these things worships Him; he follows
Him with due veneration as the Maker of all things, He as his true Father, who measures
the excellence of His majesty according to the invention, the commencement, and completion
of His works. What more evident argument can be brought forward that God both made
the world for the sake of man, and man for His own sake, than that he alone of all living
creatures has been so formed that his eyes are directed towards heaven, his face looking towards
God, his countenance is in fellowship with his Parent, so that God appears, as it were,
with outstretched hand to have raised man from the ground, and to have elevated him to
the contemplation of Himself. “What, then,” he says, “does the worship paid by man confer
on God, who is blessed, and in want of nothing? Or if He gave such honour to man as to
create the world for his sake, to furnish him with wisdom, to make him lord of all things
living, and to love him as a son, why did He make him subject to death and decay? why did
He expose the object of His love to all evils? when it was befitting that man should be happy,

<pb n="442"/>
as though closely connected with God, and everlasting as He is, to the worship and contemplation
of whom he was formed.”</p>
<p>Although we have taught these things for the most part in a scattered manner in the
former books, nevertheless, since the subject now specially requires it, because we have undertaken
to discuss the subject of a happy life, these things are to be explained by us more
carefully and fully, that the arrangement made by God, and His work and will, may be
known. Though He was always able by His own immortal Spirit to produce innumerable
souls, as He produced the angels, to whom there exists immortality without any danger and
fear of evils, yet He devised an unspeakable work, in what manner He might create an infinite
multitude of souls, which being at first united with frail and feeble bodies, He might place
in the midst between good and evil, that He might set virtue before them composed as they
were of both natures; that they might not attain to immortality by a delicate and easy course
of life, but might arrive at that unspeakable reward of eternal life with the utmost difficulty
and great labours. Therefore, that He might clothe them with limbs which were heavy and
liable to injury,1313 since they were unable to exist in the middle void, the weight and gravity
of the body sinking downwards, He determined that an abode and dwelling-place should
first be built for them. And thus with unspeakable energy and power He contrived the surpassing
works of the world; and having suspended the light elements on high, and depressed
the heavy ones to the depths below, He strengthened the heavenly things, and established
the earthly. It is not necessary at present to follow out each point separately, since we discussed
them all together in the second book.</p>
<p>Therefore He placed in the heaven lights, whose regularity, and brightness, and motion,
were most suitably proportioned to the advantage of living beings. Moreover, He gave to
the earth, which He designed as their dwelling-place, fruitfulness for bringing forth and
producing various1314 things, that by the abundance of fruits and green herbs it might
supply nourishment according to the nature and requirements of each kind. Then, when
He had completed all things which belonged to the condition of the world, He formed man
from the earth itself, which He prepared for him from the beginning as a habitation; that
is, He clothed and covered his spirit with an earthly body, that, being compacted of different
and opposing materials, he might be susceptible of good and evil; and as the earth itself is
fruitful for the bringing forth of grain, so the body of man, which was taken from the earth,
received the power of producing offspring, that, inasmuch as he was formed of a fragile
substance, and could not exist for ever, when the space of his temporal life was past, he
might depart, and by a perpetual succession renew that which he bore, which was frail and
feeble. Why, then, did He make him frail and mortal, when He had built the world for his
<note type="footnote">1313 Vexabilibus.</note>
<note type="footnote">1314 Varia. Others read, “fæcunditatem variam generandi.”</note>

<pb n="443"/>
sake? First of all, that an infinite number of living beings might be produced, and that He
might fill all the earth with a multitude; in the next place, that He might set before man
virtue, that is, endurance of evils and labours, by which he might be able to gain the reward
of immortality. For since man consists of two parts, body and soul, of which the one is
earthly, the other heavenly, two lives have been assigned to man: the one temporal, which
is appointed for the body; the other everlasting, which belongs to the soul. We received the
former at our birth we attain to the latter by striving, that immortality might not exist to
man without any difficulty. That earthly one is as the body, and therefore has an end; but
this heavenly one is as the soul, and therefore has no limit. We received the first when we
were ignorant of it, this second knowingly; for it is given to virtue, not to nature, because
God wished that we should procure life for ourselves in life.</p>
<p>For this reason He has given us this present life, that we may either lose that true and
eternal life by our vices, or win it1315 by virtue. The chief good is not contained in this
bodily life, since, as it was given to us by divine necessity, so it will again be destroyed by
divine necessity. Thus that which has an end does not contain the chief good. But the chief
good is contained in that spiritual life which we acquire by ourselves, because it cannot
contain evil, or have an end; to which subject nature and the system of the body afford an
argument. For other animals incline towards the ground, because they are earthly, and are
incapable of immortality, which is from heaven; but man is upright and looks towards
heaven,1316 because immortality is proposed to him; which, however, does not come, unless
it is given to man by God. For otherwise there would be no difference between the just and
the unjust, since every man who is born would become immortal. Immortality, then, is not
the consequence1317 of nature, but the reward and recompense of virtue. Lastly, man does
not immediately upon his birth walk upright, but at first on all fours,1318 because the nature
of his body and of this present life is common to us with the dumb animals; afterwards,
when his strength is confirmed, he raises himself, and his tongue is loosened so that he
speaks plainly, and he ceases to be a dumb animal. And this argument teaches that man is
<note type="footnote">1315 Mereamur.</note>
<note type="footnote">1316 [Our author never wearies of this reference to Ovid’s beautiful verses. Compare Cowper (Task, book
v.) as follows:— “Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone And eyes intent upon the scanty

Beneath, beyond, and stretching far away From inland regions to the distant main. Not so the
mind that has been touched from heaven. . . . She often holds, With

born mortal; but that he afterwards becomes immortal, when he begins to live in conformity
with the will1319 of God, that is, to follow righteousness,1320 which is comprised in the
worship of God, since God raised man to a view of the heaven and of Himself. And this
takes place when man, purified in the heavenly laver, lays aside1321 his infancy together
with all the pollution of his past life, and having received an increase of divine vigour, becomes
a perfect and complete man.</p>
<p>Therefore, because God has set forth virtue before man, although the soul and the body
are connected together, yet they are contrary, and oppose one another. The things which
are good for the soul are evil to the body, that is, the avoiding of riches, the prohibiting of
pleasures, the contempt of pain and death. In like manner, the things which are good for
the body are evil to the soul, that is, desire and lust, by which riches are desired, and the
enjoyments of various pleasures, by which the soul is weakened and destroyed.1322 Therefore
it is necessary, that the just and wise man should be engaged in all evils, since fortitude is
victorious over evils; but the unjust in riches, in honours, in power. For these goods relate
to the body, and are earthly; and these men also lead an earthly life, nor are they able to attain
to immortality, because they have given themselves up to pleasures which are the enemies
of virtue. Therefore this temporal life ought to be subject to that eternal life, as the body is
to the soul. Whoever, then, prefers the life of the soul must despise the life of the body; nor
will he in any other way be able to strive after that which is highest, unless he shall have
despised the things which are lowest. But he who shall have embraced the life of the body,
and shall have turned his desires downwards1323 to the earth, is unable to attain to that
higher life. But he who prefers to live well for eternity, will live badly1324 for a time, and will
be subjected to all troubles and labours as long as he shall be on earth, that he may have divine
and heavenly consolation. And he who shall prefer to live well1325 for a time, will live ill to
eternity; for he will be condemned by the sentence of God to eternal punishment, because
he has preferred earthly to heavenly goods. On this account, therefore, God seeks to be
worshipped, and to be honoured by man as a Father, that he may have virtue and wisdom,

which alone produce immortality. For because no other but Himself is able to confer that
immortality, since He alone possesses it, He will grant1326 to the piety of the man, with
which he has honoured God, this reward, to be blessed to all eternity, and to be for ever in
the presence of God and in the society of God.</p>
<p>N.B.—The following paragraphs to the end of the chapter are wanting many mss., and it is very
doubtful whether they were written by Lactantius.</p>
<p>Nor can any one shelter himself under the pretext that the fault belongs to Him who
made both good and evil. For why did He will that evil should exist if He hated it? Why did
He not make good only, that no one might sin, no one commit evil? Although I have explained
this in almost all the former books, and have touched upon it, though slightly, above,
yet it must be mentioned repeatedly, because the whole matter turns on this point. For there
could be no virtue unless He had made contrary things; nor can the power of good be at all
manifest, except from a comparison with evil. Thus evil is nothing else but the explanation
of good. Therefore if evil is taken away, good must also be taken away. If you shall cut off
your left hand or foot, your body will not be entire, nor will life itself remain the same. Thus,
for the due adjustment of the framework of the body, the left members are most suitably
joined with the right. In like manner, if you make chessmen1327 all alike, no one will play.
If you shall give one colour1328 only to the circus, no one will think it worth while to be a
spectator, all the pleasure of the Circensian games being taken away. For he who first instituted
the games was a favourer of one colour; but he introduced another as a rival, that there
might be a contest, and some partisanship1329 in the spectacle. Thus God, when He was
fixing that which was good, and giving virtue, appointed also their contraries, with which
they might contend. If an enemy and a fight be wanting, there is no victory. Take away a
contest, and even virtue is nothing. How many are the mutual contests of men, and with
what various arts are they carried on! No one, however, would be regarded as surpassing in
bravery, swiftness, or excellence, if he bad no adversary with whom he might contend. And
where victory is wanting, there also glory and the reward of victory must be absent together
with it. Therefore, that he might strengthen virtue itself by continual exercise, and might

make it perfect from its conflict with evils, He gave both together, because each of the two
without the other is unable to retain its force. Therefore there is diversity, on which the
whole system of truth depends.</p>
<p>It does not escape my notice what may here be urged in opposition by more skilful
persons. If good cannot exist without evil, how do you say that, before he had offended God,
the first man lived in the exercise of good only, or that he will hereafter live in the exercise
of good only? This question is to be examined by us, for in the former books I omitted it,
that I might here fill up the subject. We have said above that the nature of man is made up
of opposing elements; for the body, because it is earth, is capable of being grasped, of temporary
duration, senseless, and dark. But the soul, because it is from heaven, is unsubstantial,
1330 everlasting, endued with sensibility, and full of lustre;1331 and because these qualities
are opposed to one another, it follows of necessity that man is subject to good and evil. Good
is ascribed to the soul, because it is incapable of dissolution; evil to the body, because it is
frail. Since, therefore, the body and the soul are connected and united together, the good
and the evil must necessarily hold together; nor can they be separated from one another,
unless when they (the body and soul) are separated. Finally, the knowledge of good and of
evil was given at the same time to the first man; and when he understood this, he was immediately
driven from the holy place in which there is no evil; for when he was conversant with
that which was good only, he was ignorant that this itself was good. But after that he had
received the knowledge of good and evil, it was now unlawful for him to remain in that
place of happiness, and he was banished to this common world, that he might at once experience
both of those things with the nature of which he had at once become acquainted. It is
plain, therefore, that wisdom has been given to man that he may distinguish good from
evil—that he may discriminate between things advantageous and things disadvantageous,
between things useful and things useless—that he may have judgment and consideration
as to what he ought to guard against, what to desire, what to avoid, and what to follow.
Wisdom therefore cannot exist without evil; and that first author1332 of the human race, as
long as he was conversant with good only, lived as an infant, ignorant of good and evil. But,
indeed, hereafter man must be both wise and happy without any evil; but this cannot take
place as long as the soul is clothed with the abode of the body.</p>
<p>But when a separation shall have been made between the body and the soul, then evil
will be disunited from good; and as the body perishes and the soul remains, so evil will
perish and good be permanent. Then man, having received the garment of immortality, will
be wise and free from evil, as God is. He, therefore, who wishes that we should be conversant
<note type="footnote">1330 Tenuis.</note>
<note type="footnote">1331 Illustris.</note>
<note type="footnote">1332 Princeps.</note>

<pb n="447"/>
with good only, especially desires this, that we should live without the body, in which evil
is. But if evil is taken away, either wisdom, as I have said, or the body, will be taken from
man; wisdom, that he may be ignorant of evil; the body, that he may not be sensible of it.
But now, since man is furnished with wisdom to know, and a body to perceive, God willed
that both should exist alike in this life, that virtue and wisdom may be in agreement.
Therefore He placed man in the midst, between both, that he might have liberty to follow
either good or evil. But He mingled with evil some things which appear good, that is, various
and delightful enjoyments, that by the enticements of these He might lead men to the concealed
evil. And He likewise mingled with good some things which appear evil—that is,
hardships, and miseries, and labours—by the harshness and unpleasantness of which the
soul, being offended, might shrink back from the concealed good. But here the office of
wisdom is needed, that we may see more with the mind than with the body, which very few
are able to do; because while virtue is difficult and rarely to be found, pleasure is common
and public. Thus it necessarily happens that the wise man is accounted as a fool, who, while
he seeks good things which are not seen, permits those which are seen to slip from his hands;
and while he avoids evils which are not seen, runs into evils which are before the eyes; which
happens to us when we refuse neither torture nor death in behalf of the faith, since we are
driven to the greatest wickedness, so as to betray the faith and deny the true God, and to
sacrifice to dead and death-bearing gods. This is the cause why God made man mortal, and
made him subject to evils, although he had framed the world for his sake, namely, that he
might be capable of virtue, and that his virtue might reward him with immortality. Now
virtue, as we have shown, is the worship of the true God.</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.—WHY THE WORLD AND MAN WERE CREATED. HOW UNPROFITABLE
IS THE WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS.</head>
<p>Now let us mark the whole argument by a brief definition.1333 The world has been
created for this purpose, that we may be born; we are born for this end, that we may acknowledge
the Maker of the world and of ourselves—God; we acknowledge Him for this end,
that we may worship Him; we worship Him for this end, that we may receive immortality
as the reward of our labours, since the worship of God consists of the greatest labours; for
this end we are rewarded with immortality, that being made like to the angels, we may serve
the Supreme Father and Lord for ever, and may be to all eternity a kingdom to God. This
is the sum of all things, this the secret of God, this the mystery of the world, from which
they are estranged, who, following present gratification, have devoted themselves to the
pursuit of earthly and frail goods, and by means of deadly enjoyments have sunk as it were
in mire and mud their souls, which were born for heavenly pursuits.</p>
<p>Let us now, in the next place, inquire whether there is anything reasonable in the worship
of these gods; for if they are many, if they are worshipped only on this account by men, that
they may afford them riches, victories, honours, and all things, which are of no avail except
for the present; if we are produced without cause—if no providence is employed in the
production of men—if we are brought forth by chance for ourselves, and for the sake of our
own pleasure—if we are nothing after death,—what can be so superfluous, so empty, so
vain, as the affairs of man, and the world itself? which, though it is of incredible magnitude,
and constructed with such wonderful arrangement, is nevertheless occupied with trifling
subjects. For why should the breathings of the winds put the clouds in motion? Why should
lightnings shine forth, thunders roar, or showers fall, that the earth may bring forth its increase,
and nourish its various productions? Why, in short, should all nature labour that
nothing may be wanting of those things by which the life of man is sustained, if it is vain,
if we utterly perish, if there is in us nothing of greater advantage to God? But if it is unlawful
to be spoken, and is not to be thought possible, that that which you see to be most in accordance
with reason was not established on account of some reason of importance, what reason
can there be in these errors of depraved religions, and in this persuasion of philosophers,
by which they imagine that souls perish? Assuredly there is none; for what have they to say
why the gods so regularly supply to men everything in its season? Is it that we may present
to them corn and wine, and the odour of incense, and the blood of cattle? Which things
cannot be acceptable to the immortals, because they are perishable; nor can they be of use
to beings destitute of bodies, because these things have been given for the use of those possessed
of bodies; and yet if they required these things, they could bestow them upon themselves
when they wished. Whether, therefore, souls perish or exist for ever, what principle
<note type="footnote">1333 Circumscriptione.</note>

<pb n="449"/>
is involved in the worship of the gods, or by whom was the world established? Why, or
when, or how long, or how far were men produced, or on what account? Why do they arise,
die, succeed one another, are renewed? What do the gods obtain from the worship of those
who after death are about to have no existence? What do they perform, what do they
promise, what do they threaten, which is worthy of men or of gods? Or if souls remain after
death, what do they do or are they about to do respecting them? What need is there to them
of a treasure-house of souls? From what source do they themselves arise? How, or why, or
whence are they so many? Thus it comes to pass, that if you depart from that sum of things
which we comprised above, all system is destroyed, and all things return1334 to nothing.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF THE VARIETY OF PHILOSOPHERS, AND THEIR TRUTH.</head>
<p>And because the philosophers did not comprehend this main point, they were neither
able to comprehend truth, although they for the most part both saw and explained those
things of which the main point itself consists. But different persons brought forward all
these things, and in different ways, not connecting the causes of things, nor the consequences,
nor the reasons, so that they might join together and complete that main point which
comprises the whole. But it is easy to show that almost the whole truth has been divided by
philosophers and sects. For we do not overthrow philosophy, as the Academics are accustomed
to do, whose plan was to reply to everything, which is rather to calumniate and mock;
but we show that no sect was so much out of the way, and no philosopher so vain, as not to
see something of the truth.1335 But while they are mad with the desire of contradicting,
while they defend their own arguments even though false, and overthrow those of others
even though true, not only has the truth escaped from them, which they pretended that they
were seeking, but they themselves lost it chiefly through their own fault. But if there had
been any one to collect together the truth which was dispersed amongst individuals and
scattered amongst sects, and to reduce it to a body, he assuredly would not disagree with
us. But no one is able to do this, unless he has experience1336 and knowledge of the truth.
But to know the truth belongs to him only who has been taught by God. For he cannot in
any other way reject the things which are false, or choose and approve of those which are
true; but if even by chance he should effect this, he would most surely act the part of the
philosopher; and though he could not defend those things by divine testimonies, yet the
truth would explain itself by its own light. Wherefore the error of those is incredible, who,
when they have approved of any sect, and have devoted themselves to it, condemn all others
as false and vain, and arm themselves for battle, neither knowing what they ought to defend
nor what to refute; and make attacks everywhere, without distinction,1337 upon all things
which are brought forward by those who disagree with them.</p>
<p>On account of these most obstinate contentions of theirs, no philosophy existed which
made a nearer approach to the truth, for the whole truth has been comprised by these in
separate portions.1338 Plato said1339 that the world was made by God: the prophets1340
speak the same; and the same is apparent from the verses of the Sibyl. They therefore are in
error, who have said either that all things were produced of their own accord or from an

assemblage of atoms;1341 since so great a world, so adorned and of such magnitude, could
neither have been made nor arranged and set in order without some most skilful author,
and that very arrangement by which all things are perceived to be kept together and to be
governed bespeaks1342 an artificer with a most skilful mind. The Stoics say that the world,
and all things which are in it, were made for the sake of men: the sacred writings1343 teach
us the same thing. Therefore Democritus was in error, who thought that they were poured
forth from the earth like worms, without any author or plan. For the reason of man’s creation
belongs to a divine mystery; and because he was unable to know this, he drew1344 down
man’s life to nothing. Aristo asserted that men were born to the exercise of virtue; we are
also reminded of and learn the same from the prophets. Therefore Aristippus is deceived,
who made man subject to pleasure, that is, to evil, as though he were a beast. Pherecydes
and Plato contended that souls were immortal; but this is a peculiar doctrine in our religion.
Therefore Dicæarchus was mistaken, together with Democritus, who argued that souls
perished with the body and were dissolved, Zeno the Stoic taught that there were infernal
regions, and that the abodes of the good were separated from the wicked; and that the former
enjoyed peaceful and delightful regions, but that the latter suffered punishment in dark
places, and in dreadful abysses of mire: the prophets show the same thing. Therefore Epicurus
was mistaken, who thought that that was an invention1345 of the poets, and explained those
punishments of the infernal regions, which are spoken of, as happening in this life. Therefore
the philosophers touched upon the whole truth, and every secret of our holy religion; but
when others denied it, they were unable to defend that which they had found, because the
system did not agree1346 with the particulars; nor were they able to reduce to a summary
those things which they had perceived to be true, as we have done above.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</head>
<p>The one chief good, therefore, is immortality, for the reception of which we were originally
formed and born. To this we direct our course; human nature regards this; to this virtue
exalts us. And because we have discovered this good, it remains that we should also speak
of immortality itself. The arguments of Plato, although they contribute much to the subject,
have little strength to prove and fill up the truth, since he had neither summed up and collected
into one the plan of the whole of this great mystery, nor had he comprehended the
chief good. For although he perceived the truth respecting the immortality of the soul, yet
he did not speak respecting it as though it were the chief good. We, therefore, are able to
elicit the truth by more certain signs; for we have not collected it by doubtful surmise,1347
but have known it by divine instruction. Now Plato thus reasoned, that whatever has perception
by itself, and always moves, is immortal; for that that which has no beginning of
motion is not about to have an end, because it cannot be deserted by itself. But this argument
would give eternal existence even to dumb animals, unless he had made a distinction by the
addition of wisdom. He added, therefore, that he might escape this common1348 linking
together, that the soul of man could not be otherwise than immortal, since its wonderful
skill in invention, its quickness in reflection, and its readiness in perceiving and learning,
its memory of the past, and its foresight of the future, and its knowledge of innumerable
arts and subjects, which other living creatures do not possess, appear divine and heavenly;
because of the soul, which conceives such great things, and contains such great things, no
origin can be found on earth, since it has nothing of earthly admixture united with it. But
that which is ponderous in man, and liable to dissolution, must be resolved into earth;
whereas that which is slight and subtle is incapable of division, and when freed from the
abode of the body, as from prison, it flies to the heaven, and to its own nature. This is a brief
summary of the tenets of Plato, which are widely and copiously explained in his own writings.</p>
<p>Pythagoras also was previously of the same sentiments, and his teacher Pherecydes,
whom Cicero reported to have been the first who discoursed respecting the immortality of
the soul. And although all these excelled in eloquence, nevertheless in this contest at least,
those who argued against this opinion had no less authority; Dicæarchus first, then
Democritus, and lastly Epicurus: so that the matter itself, respecting which they were contending,
was called into doubt. Finally, Tullius also having set forth the opinions of all these
respecting immortality and death, declared that he did not know what was the truth. “Which
of these opinions is true,” he said, “some God may see.”1349 And again he says in another

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AND OF VIRTUE.</head>
<p>By these arguments, therefore, which neither Plato nor any other invented, the immorality
of souls can be proved and perceived: which arguments we will briefly collect, since
my discourse hastens on to relate the great judgment of God, which will be celebrated on
the earth at the approaching end of the world.1350 Before all things, since God cannot be
seen by man, lest any one should imagine from this circumstance that God does not exist,
because He was not seen by mortal eyes, among other wonderful arrangements.1351 He also
made many things the power of which is manifest, but the substance is not seen, as the voice,
smell, the wind, that by the token and example of these things we might perceive God from
His power and operation and works, although He did not fall under the notice of our eyes.
What is clearer than the voice, or stronger than the wind, or more forcible than smell? Yet
these, when they are borne through the air and come to our senses, and impel them by their
efficacy, are not distinguished by the eyesight, but are perceived by other parts of the body.
In like manner, God is not to be perceived by us through the sight or other frail sense; but
He is to be beheld by the eyes of the mind, since we see His illustrious and wonderful works.
For as to those who have altogether denied the existence of God, I should not only refuse
to call them philosophers, but even deny them the name of men, who, with a close resemblance
to dumb animals, consisted of body only, discerning nothing with their mind, and
referring all things to the bodily senses, who thought that nothing existed but that which
they beheld with their eyes. And because they saw that adversity befell the wicked, or
prosperity happened to the good, they believed that all things were carried on by fortune,
and that the world was established by nature, and not by providence.</p>
<p>Hence they at once fell into the absurdities1352 which necessarily followed such a sentiment.
But if there is a God who is incorporeal, invisible, and eternal, therefore it is credible
that the soul, since it is not seen, does not perish after its departure from the body; for it is
manifest that something exists which perceives and is vigorous, and yet does not come into
sight. But, it is said, it is difficult to comprehend with the mind how the soul can retain its
perception without those parts of the body in which the office of perception is contained.
What about God? Is it easy to comprehend how He is vigorous without a body? But if they
believe in the existence of gods who, if they exist, are plainly destitute of bodies, it must be
that human souls exist in the same way, since it is perceived from reason itself, and discernment,
that there is a certain resemblance in man and God. Finally, that proof which even
Marcus Tullius1353 saw is of sufficient strength: that the immortality of the soul may be
<note type="footnote">1350 Appropinquante sæculorum fine.</note>

<note type="footnote">1352 Deliramenta.</note>
<note type="footnote">1353 De Leg., i. 8.</note>

<pb n="455"/>
discerned from the fact that there is no other animal which has any knowledge of God; and
religion is almost the only thing which distinguishes man from the dumb creation. And
since this falls to man alone, it assuredly testifies that we may aim at, desire, and cultivate
that which is about to be familiar and very near.</p>
<p>Can any one, when he has considered the nature of other animals, which the providence
of the Supreme God has made abject, with bodies bending down and prostrated to the earth,
so that it may be understood from this that they have no intercourse with heaven, fail to
understand that man alone of all animals is heavenly and divine, whose body raised from
the ground,1354 elevated countenance, and upright position, goes in quest of its origin, and
despising, as it were, the lowliness of the earth, reaches forth to that which is on high, because
he perceives that the highest good is to be sought by him in the highest place, and mindful
of his condition in which God made him illustrious, looks towards his Maker? And
Trismegistus most rightly called this looking a contemplation of God,1355 which has no
existence in the dumb animals. Since therefore wisdom, which is given to man alone, is
nothing else but the knowledge of God, it is evident that the soul does not perish, nor undergo
dissolution, but that it remains for ever, because it seeks after and loves God, who is everlasting,
by the impulse of its very nature perceiving either from what source it has sprung, or
to what it is about to return. Moreover, it is no slight proof of immortality that man alone
makes use of the heavenly element. For, since the nature of the world consists of two elements1356
which are opposed to one another—fire and water—of which the one is assigned
to the heaven, the other to the earth, the other living creatures, because they are of the earth
and mortal, make use of the element which is earthly and heavy: man alone makes use of
fire, which is an element light, rising upward,1357 and heavenly. But those things which are
weighty depress to death, and those which are light elevate to life; because life is on high,
and death below. And as there cannot be light without fire, so there cannot be life without
light. Therefore fire is the element of light and life; from which it is evident that man who
uses it is a partaker of an immortal condition, because that which causes life is familiar to
him.</p>
<p>The gift of virtue also to man alone is a great proof that souls are immortal. For this will
not be in accordance with nature if the soul is extinguished; for it is injurious to this present
life. For that earthly life, which we lead in common with dumb animals, both seeks pleasure,
by the varied and agreeable fruits of which it is delighted, and avoids pain, the harshness of
which, by its unpleasant sensations, injures the nature of living beings, and endeavours to

lead them to death, which dissolves the living being. If, therefore, virtue both prohibits man
from those goods which are naturally desired, and impels him to endure evils which are
naturally avoided, it follows that virtue is an evil, and opposed to nature; and he must necessarily
be judged foolish who pursues it, since he injures himself both by avoiding present
goods, and by seeking equally evils, without hope of greater advantage. For when it is permitted
us to enjoy the sweetest pleasures, should we not appear to be without sense if we
should not prefer to live in lowliness, in want, in contempt and ignominy, or not to live at
all, but to be tormented with pain, and to die, when from these evils we should gain nothing
to compensate us for the pleasure which we have given up? But if virtue is not an evil, and
acts honourably, inasmuch as it despises vicious and shameful pleasures, and bravely, inasmuch
as it neither fears pain nor death, that it may discharge its duty, therefore it must obtain
some greater good than those things are which it despises. But when death has been undergone,
what further good can be hoped for except immortality?</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF VICES AND VIRTUES, AND OF LIFE AND DEATH.</head>
<p>Let us now in turn pass on to those things which are opposed to virtue, that from these
also the immortality of the soul may be inferred. All vices are for a time; for they are excited
for the present. The impetuosity of anger is appeased when vengeance has been taken; the
pleasure of the body puts an end1358 to lust; desire is destroyed either by the full enjoyment
of the objects which it seeks, or by the excitement of other affections; ambition, when it has
gained the honours which it wished for, loses1359 its strength; likewise the other vices are
unable to stand their ground and remain, but they are ended by the very enjoyment which
they desire. Therefore they withdraw and return. But virtue is perpetual, without any intermission;
nor can he who has once taken it up depart from it. For if it should have any interruption,
1360 if we can at any time do without it, vices, which always oppose virtue, will return.
Therefore it has not been grasped, if it deserts its post, if at any time it withdraws itself. But
when it has established for itself a firm abode, it must necessarily be engaged in every act;
nor can it faithfully drive away and put to flight vices, unless it shall fortify with a perpetual
guard the breast which it inhabits. Therefore the uninterrupted duration1361 of virtue itself
shows that the soul of man, if it has received virtue, remains permanent, because virtue is
perpetual, and it is the human mind alone which receives virtue. Since, therefore, vices are
contrary to virtue, the whole systems must of necessity differ from and be contrary to each
other. Because vices are commotions and perturbations of the soul; virtue, on the contrary,
is mildness and tranquillity of mind. Because vices are temporary, and of short duration;
virtue is perpetual and constant, and always consistent with itself. Because the fruits of vices,
that is, pleasures, equally with themselves, are short and temporary, therefore the fruit and
reward of virtue are everlasting. Because the advantage of vices is immediate, therefore that
of virtue is future.</p>
<p>Thus it happens that in this life there is no reward of virtue, because virtue itself still
exists. For as, when vices are completed in their performance, pleasure and their rewards
follow; so, when virtue has been ended, its reward follows. But virtue is never ended except
by death, since its highest office is in the undergoing of death: therefore the reward of virtue
is after death. In fine, Cicero, in his Tusculan Disputations,1362 perceived, though with
doubt, that the chief good does not happen to man except after death. “A man will go,” he
says, “with confident spirit, if circumstances shall so happen, to death, in which we have
ascertained that there is either the chief good or no evil.” Death, therefore, does not extinguish

man, but admits him to the reward of virtue. But he who has contaminated himself,1363 as
the same writer says, with vices and crimes, and has been the slave of pleasure, he truly, being
condemned, shall suffer eternal punishment, which the sacred writings call the second death,
which is both eternal and full of the severest torments.1364 For as two lives are proposed to
man, of which the one belongs to the soul, the other to the body; so also two deaths are
proposed,—one relating to the body, which all must undergo according to nature, the other
relating to the soul, which is acquired by wickedness and avoided by virtue. As this life is
temporary and has fixed limits, because it belongs to the body; so also death is in like manner
temporary and has a fixed end, because it affects the body.</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF THE LAST TIMES, AND OF THE SOUL AND BODY.</head>
<p>Therefore, when the times which God has appointed for death shall be completed, death
itself shall be ended. And because temporal death follows temporal life, it follows that souls
rise again to everlasting life, because temporal death has received an end. Again, as the life
of the soul is everlasting, in which it receives the divine and unspeakable fruits of its immortality;
also its death must be eternal, in which it suffers perpetual punishments and infinite
torments for its faults. Therefore things are in this position, that they who are happy in this
life, pertaining to the body and the earth, are about to be miserable for ever, because they
have already enjoyed the good things which they preferred, which happens to those who
adore false gods and neglect the true God. In the next place, they who, following righteousness,
have been miserable, and despised, and poor in this life, and have often been harassed
with insults and injuries on account of righteousness itself, because virtue cannot otherwise
be attained, are about to be always happy, that since they have already endured evils, they
may also enjoy goods. Which plainly happens to those who, having despised gods of the
earth and frail goods, follow the heavenly religion of God, whose goods are everlasting, as
He Himself who gave them. What shall I say of the works of the body and soul? Do not they
show that the soul is not subject to death? For, as to the body, since it is itself frail and
mortal, whatever works it contrives are equally perishable. For Tullius says that there is
nothing which is wrought by the hands of man which is not at some time reduced to destruction,
either through injury caused by men, or through length of time, which is the destroyer
of all things.</p>
<p>But truly we see that the productions of the mind are immortal. For as many as, devoting
themselves to the contempt of present things, have handed down to memory the monuments
of their genius and great deeds, have plainly gained by these an imperishable name for their
mind and virtue. Therefore, if the deeds of the body are mortal for this reason, because the
body itself is mortal, it follows that the soul is shown to be immortal from this, because we
see that its productions are not mortal. In the same manner also, the desires of the body and
of the soul declare that the one is mortal, the other everlasting. For the body desires nothing
except what is temporal, that is, food, drink, clothing, rest, and pleasure; and it cannot desire
or attain to these very things without the assent and assistance1365 of the soul. But the soul
of itself desires many things which do not extend1366 to the duty or enjoyment of the body;
and those are not frail, but eternal, as the fame of virtue, as the remembrance of the name.
For the soul even in opposition to the body desires the worship of God, which consists in
abstinence from desires and lusts, in the enduring of pain, in the contempt of death. From
which it is credible that the soul does not perish, but is separated from the body, because
<note type="footnote">1365 Sine nutu et adminiculo animi.</note>

<pb n="460"/>
the body can do nothing without the soul, but the soul can do many and great things without
the body. Why should I mention that those things which are visible to the eyes, and capable
of being touched by the hand, cannot be eternal, because they admit of external violence;
but those things which neither come under the touch nor under the sight, but are apparent
only in their force and method and effect, are eternal because they suffer no violence from
without? But if the body is mortal on this account, because it is equally open to the sight
and to the touch, therefore the soul is immortal for this reason, because it can be neither
touched nor seen.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="461"/>
<head>CHAP. XII.—OF THE SOUL AND THE BODY, AND OF THEIR UNION AND
SEPARATION AND RETURN.</head>
<p>Now let us refute the arguments of those who maintain the opposite opinions, which
Lucretius has related in his third book. Since, he says, the soul is born together with the
body, it must necessarily die with the body. But the two cases are not similar. For the body
is solid, and capable of being grasped1367 both by the eyes and the hand; but the soul is
slight,1368 and eluding the touch and sight. The body is formed from the earth, and made
firm; the soul has in it nothing concrete, nothing of earthly weight, as Plato maintained. For
it could not have such great force, such great skill, such great rapidity, unless it derived its
origin from heaven. The body, therefore, since it is made up of a ponderous and corruptible
element, and is tangible and visible, is corrupted and dies; nor is it able to repel violence,
because it comes under the sight and under the touch; but the soul, which by its slightness
avoids all touch, can be dissolved by no attack. Therefore, although they are joined and
connected together from birth, and the one which is formed of earthly material1369 is, as it
were, the vessel of the other, which is drawn out from heavenly fineness, when any violence
has separated the two, which separation is called death, then each returns into its own nature;
that which was of earth is resolved into earth; that which is of heavenly breath remains fixed,
and flourishes always, since the divine spirit is everlasting. In fine, the same Lucretius, forgetting
what he asserted, and what dogma he defended, wrote these verses:1370—
<lg>
<l>“That also which before was from the earth passes back into the earth, and that
which was sent from the borders of ether is carried again by the quarters
of heaven.”1371</l>
</lg>
But this language was not for him to employ, who contended that souls perished with the
bodies; but he was overcome by the truth, and the true system stole upon him unawares.
Moreover, that very inference which he draws, that the soul suffers dissolution, that is, that
it perishes together with the body, since they are produced together, is both false, and is
capable of being turned to the opposite direction. For the body does not perish together
with the soul; but when the soul departs it remains entire for many days, and frequently by
medical preparations it remains entire for a very long time. For if they both perished together,
as they are produced together, the soul would not hastily depart and desert the body, but
both would be dispersed alike at one point of time; and the body also, while the breath still

<pb n="462"/>
remained in it, would dissolve and perish as quickly as the soul departs: yes, truly, the body,
being dissolved, the soul would vanish, as moisture poured forth from a broken vessel. For
if the earthly and frail body after the departure of the soul does not immediately flow away
and waste into earth, from which it has its origin, therefore the soul, which is not frail, endures
to eternity, since its origin is eternal. He says, since the understanding increases in boys,
and is vigorous in young men, and is lessened in the aged, it is evident that it is mortal. First,
the soul is not the same thing as the mind; for it is one thing that we live, another that we
reflect. For it is the mind of those who are asleep which is at rest,1372 not the soul; and in
those who are mad, the mind is extinguished, the soul remains; and therefore they are not
said to be without a soul, but to be deprived of their mind.1373 Therefore the mind, that is,
the understanding, is either increased or lessened according to age. The soul is always in its
own condition; and from the time when it receives the power of breathing, it remains the
same even to the end, until, being sent forth from the confinement of the body, it flies back
to its own abode. In the next place, the soul, although inspired by God, yet, because it is shut
up in a dark abode of earthly flesh, does not possess knowledge, which belongs to divinity.
Therefore it hears and learns all things, and receives wisdom by learning and hearing; and
old age does not lessen wisdom, but increases it, if the age of youth has been passed in virtue;
and if excessive old age shall have enfeebled the limbs, it is not the fault of the mind if the
sight has vanished, if the tongue has become benumbed, if the hearing has grown deaf, but
it is the fault of the body. But, it is said, the memory fails. What wonder, if the mind is oppressed
by the ruin of the falling house, and forgets the past, not about to be divine on any
other condition than if it shall have escaped the prison in which it is confined?</p>
<p>But the soul, he says, is also subject to pain and grief, and loses its senses through
drunkenness, whence it is evidently frail and mortal. On this account, therefore, virtue and
wisdom are necessary, that both grief, which is contracted by the suffering and the sight of
unworthy objects, may be repelled by fortitude, and that pleasure may be overcome, not
only by abstaining from drinking, but also from other things. For if it be destitute of virtue,
if it be given up to pleasure, and thus rendered effeminate, it will become subject to death,
since virtue, as we have shown, is the contriver of immortality, as pleasure is of death. But
death, as I have set forth, does not entirely extinguish and destroy, but visits with eternal
torments. For the soul cannot entirely perish, since it received its origin from the Spirit of
God, which is eternal. The soul, he says, is sensible even of disease of the body, and suffers
forgetfulness of itself; and as it grows ill, so also it is often healed. This is therefore the
reason why virtue is especially to be used, that the mind—not the soul1374—may not be

<pb n="463"/>
harassed by any pain of the body, or undergo oblivion of itself. And since this has its seat
in a certain part of the body, when any violence of disease has vitiated that part, it is moved
from its place; and as though shaken, it departs from its station, about to return when a cure
and health shall have remodelled its abode. For, since the soul is united with the body, if it
is destitute of virtue, it grows sick by the contagion of the body, and from sharing its frailty
the weakness extends to the mind. But when it shall be disunited from the body it will
flourish by itself; nor will it now be assailed by any condition of frailty, because it has laid
aside its frail covering. As the eye, he says, when torn out and separated from the body, can
see nothing, so also the soul, when separated, can perceive nothing, because it is itself also
a part of the body. This is false, and dissimilar to the case supposed; for the soul is not a part
of the body, but in the body. As that which is contained in a vessel is not a part of the vessel,
and these things which are in a house are not said to be a part of the house; so the mind is
not a part of the body, because the body is either the vessel or the receptacle of the soul.</p>
<p>Now, that is a much more empty argument which says that the soul appears to be
mortal because it is not quickly sent forth from the body, but gradually unfolds itself from
all the members, beginning from the extremity of the feet; as though, if it were eternal, it
would burst forth in a single moment of time, which takes place in those who die by the
sword. But they who are slain by disease are longer in breathing forth their spirit, so that as
the limbs grow cold the soul is breathed forth. For, since it is contained in the material of
the blood, as light is in the oil, that material being consumed by the heat of fevers, the extremities
of the limbs must grow cold; since the more slender veins are extended into the
extremities of the body, and the extreme and smaller streams are dried up when the fountainspring
fails. It must not, however, be supposed that, because the perception of the body fails,
the sensibility of the soul is extinguished and perishes. For it is not the soul that becomes
senseless when the body fails, but it is the body which becomes senseless when the soul takes
its departure, because it draws all sensibility with it. But since the soul by its presence gives
sensibility to the body, and causes it to live, it is impossible that it should not live and perceive
by itself, since it is in itself both consciousness and life. For as to that which says,
<lg>
<l>“But if our mind were immortal, it would not when dying complain so much of
its dissolution as it would rejoice in passing abroad and quitting its
vesture like a snake,”1375</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">1375 Lucret., iii. 611.</note>

<pb n="464"/>
I never saw any one who complained of his dissolution in death; but he perhaps had seen
some Epicurean philosophizing even in death, and with his latest breath discoursing about
his dissolution.</p>
<p>How can it be known whether he feels that he is in a state of dissolution, or that he is
being set free from the body, when his tongue grows dumb at his departure? For as long as
he perceives and has the power of speech, he is not yet dissolved; when he has suffered dissolution,
he is now unable either to perceive or to speak, so that either he is not yet able to
complain of his dissolution, or he is no longer able. But, it is said, he understands before he
undergoes dissolution, that he must undergo it. Why should I mention that we see many
of the dying, not complaining that they are undergoing dissolution, but testifying that they
are passing out, and setting forth on their journey and walking? and they signify this by
gesture, or if they still are able, they express it also by their voice. From which it is evident
that it is not a dissolution which takes place, but a separation; and this shows that the soul
continues to exist. Other arguments of the Epicurean system are opposed to Pythagoras,
who contends that souls migrate from bodies worn out with old age and death, and gain
admission1376 into those which are new and recently born; and that the same souls are always
reproduced at one time in a man, at another time in a sheep, at another in a wild beast, at
another in a bird; and that they are immortal on this account, because they often change
their abodes, consisting of various and dissimilar bodies. And this opinion of a senseless
man, since it is ridiculous and more worthy of a stage-player than of a school of philosophy,
ought not even to have been refuted seriously; for he who does this appears to be afraid lest
any one should believe it. Therefore we must pass by those things which have been discussed
in behalf of falsehood against falsehood; it is sufficient to have refuted those things which
are against the truth.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIII.—OF THE SOUL, AND THE TESTIMONIES CONCERNING ITS
ETERNITY.</head>
<p>I have made it evident, as I think, that the soul is not subject to dissolution. It remains
that I bring forward witnesses by whose authority my arguments may be confirmed. And I
will not now allege the testimony of the prophets, whose system and divination consist in
this alone, the teaching that man was created for the worship of God, and for receiving immortality
from Him; but I will rather bring forward those whom they who reject the truth
cannot but believe. Hermes, describing the nature of man, that he might show how he was
made by God, introduced this statement: “And the same out of two natures—the immortal
and the mortal—made one nature, that of man, making the same partly immortal, and partly
mortal; and bringing this, he placed it in the midst, between that nature which was divine
and immortal, and that which was mortal and changeable, that seeing all things, he may
admire all things.” But some one may perhaps reckon him in the number of the philosophers,
although he has been placed among the gods, and honoured by the Egyptians under the
name of Mercury, and may give no more authority to him than to Plato or Pythagoras. Let
us therefore seek for greater testimony. A certain Polites asked Apollo of Miletus whether
the soul remains after death or goes to dissolution; and he replied in these verses:—
<lg>
<l>“As long as the soul is bound by fetters to the body, perceiving corruptible sufferings,
it yields to mortal pains; but when, after the wasting of the
body, it has found a very swift dissolution of mortality, it is altogether
borne into the air, never growing old, and it remains always uninjured;
for the first-born providence of God made this disposition.”</l>
</lg>
What do the Sibylline poems say? Do they not declare that this is so, when they say that the
time will come when God will judge the living and the dead?—whose authority we will
hereafter bring forward.1377 Therefore the opinion entertained by Democritus, and Epicurus,
and Dicæarchus concerning the dissolution of the soul is false; and they would not venture
to speak concerning the destruction of souls, in the presence of any magician, who knew
that souls are called forth from the lower regions by certain incantations, and that they are
at hand, and afford themselves to be seen by human eyes, and speak, and foretell future
events; and if they should thus venture, they would be overpowered by the fact itself, and
by proofs presented to them. But because they did not comprehend the nature of the soul,
which is so subtle that it escapes the eyes of the human mind, they said that it perishes. What
of Aristoxenus, who denied that there is any soul at all, even while it lives in the body? But
as on the lyre harmonious sound, and the strain which musicians call harmony, is produced
<note type="footnote">1377 [ “Dies iræ, dies illa,… Teste David et Sibylla ” i.e., divine and ethnic oracles
alike are full of it. See note 9, p. 116, supra. Elucidation V.]</note>

<pb n="466"/>
by the tightening of the strings, so he thought that the power of perception existed in bodies
from the joining together of the vitals, and from the vigour of the limbs; than which nothing
can be said more senseless. Truly he had his eyes uninjured, but his heart was blind, with
which he did not see that he lived, and had the mind by which he had conceived that very
thought. But this has happened to many philosophers, that they did not believe in the existence
of any object which is not apparent to the eyes; whereas the sight of the mind ought
to be much clearer than that of the body, for perceiving those things the force and nature
of which are rather felt than seen.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">

<head>CHAP. XIV.—OF THE FIRST AND LAST TIMES OF THE WORLD.</head>
<p>Since we have spoken of the immortality of the soul, it follows that we teach how and
when it is given to man; that in this also they may see the errors of their perverseness and
folly, who imagine that some mortals have become gods by the decrees and dogmas of
mortals; either because they had invented arts, or because they had taught the use of certain
productions of the earth, or because they had discovered things useful for the life of men,
or because they had slain savage beasts. How far these things were from deserving immortality
we have both shown in the former books, and we will now show, that it may be evident
that it is righteousness alone which procures for man eternal life, and that it is God alone
who bestows the reward of eternal life. For they who are said to have been immortalized by
their merits, inasmuch as they possessed neither righteousness nor any true virtue, did not
obtain for themselves immortality, but death by their sins and lusts; nor did they deserve
the reward of heaven, but the punishment of hell, which impends over them, together with
all their worshippers. And I show that the time of this judgment draws near, that the due
reward may be given to the righteous, and the deserved punishment may be inflicted on the
wicked.</p>
<p>Plato and many others of the philosophers, since they were ignorant of the origin of all
things, and of that primal period at which the world was made, said that many thousands
of ages had passed since this beautiful arrangement of the world was completed; and in this
they perhaps followed the Chaldeans, who, as Cicero has related in his first book respecting
divination,1378 foolishly say1379 that they possess comprised in their memorials four hundred
and seventy thousand years; in which matter, because they thought that they could not be
convicted, they believed that they were at liberty1380 to speak falsely. But we, whom the
Holy Scriptures instruct to the knowledge of the truth, know the beginning and the end of
the world, respecting which we will now speak in the end of our work, since we have explained
respecting the beginning in the second book. Therefore let the philosophers, who enumerate
thousands of ages from the beginning of the world, know that the six thousandth year is
not yet completed, and that when this number is completed the consummation must take
place, and the condition of human affairs be remodelled for the better, the proof of which
must first be related, that the matter itself may be plain. God completed the world and this
admirable work of nature in the space of six days, as is contained in the secrets of Holy
Scripture, and consecrated the seventh day, on which He had rested from His works. But
this is the Sabbath-day, which in the language of the Hebrews received its name from the
<note type="footnote">1378 i. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">1379 Delirant.</note>
<note type="footnote">1380 Liberum esse.</note>

<pb n="468"/>
number,1381 whence the seventh is the legitimate and complete number. For there are seven
days, by the revolutions of which in order the circles of years are made up; and there are
seven stars which do not set, and seven luminaries which are called planets,1382 whose differing
and unequal movements are believed to cause the varieties of circumstances and
times.1383</p>
<p>Therefore, since all the works of God were completed in six days, the world must continue
in its present state through six ages, that is, six thousand years. For the great day of
God is limited by a circle of a thousand years, as the prophet shows, who says1384 “In Thy
sight, O Lord, a thousand years are as one day.” And as God laboured during those six days
in creating such great works, so His religion and truth must labour during these six thousand
years, while wickedness prevails and bears rule. And again, since God, having finished His
works, rested the seventh day and blessed it, at the end of the six thousandth year all
wickedness must be abolished from the earth, and righteousness reign for a thousand years;
and there must be tranquillity and rest from the labours which the world now has long endured.
But how that will come to pass I will explain in its order. We have often said that
lesser things and things of small importance are figures and previous shadowings forth of
great things; as this day of ours, which is bounded by the rising and the setting of the sun,
is a representation1385 of that great day to which the circuit of a thousand years affixes its
limits.1386</p>
<p>In the same manner also the fashioning of the earthly man held forth to the future the
formation of the heavenly people. For as, when all things were completed which were con-
trived for the use of man, last of all, on the sixth day, He made man also, and introduced
him into this world as into a home now carefully prepared; so now on the great sixth day
the true man is being formed by the word of God, that is, a holy people is fashioned for
righteousness by the doctrine and precepts of God. And as then a mortal and imperfect man
was formed from the earth, that he might live a thousand years in this world; so now from
this earthly age is formed a perfect man, that being quickened by God, he may bear rule in
this same world through a thousand years. But in what manner the consummation will take
place, and what end awaits the affairs of men, if any one shall examine the divine writings

he will ascertain. But the voices also of prophets of the world, agreeing with the heavenly,
announce the end and overthrow of all things after a short time, describing as it were the

<head>CHAP. XV.—OF THE DEVASTATION OF THE WORLD AND CHANGE OF THE
EMPIRES.</head>
<p>It is contained in the mysteries of the sacred writings, that a prince of the Hebrews,
compelled by want of corn, passed into Egypt with all his family and relatives. And when
his posterity, remaining long in Egypt, had increased into a great nation, and were oppressed
by the heavy and intolerable yoke of slavery, God smote Egypt with an incurable stroke, and
freed His people, leading them through the midst of the sea, when, the waves being cut
asunder and parted on either side, the people went over on dry ground. And the king of the
Egyptians endeavouring to follow them as they fled, the sea returning to its place, he was
cut off, with all his people. And this deed so illustrious and so wonderful, although for the
present it displayed to men the power of God, was also a foreshadowing and figure of a
greater deed, which the same God was about to perform at the last consummation of the
times, for He will free His people from the oppressive bondage of the world. But since at
that time the people of God were one, and in one nation only, Egypt only was smitten. But
now, because the people of God are collected out of all languages, and dwell among all nations,
and are oppressed by those bearing rule over them, it must come to pass that all nations,
that is, the whole world, be beaten with heavenly stripes, that the righteous people, who are
worshippers of God, may be set free. And as then signs were given by which the coming
destruction was shown to the Egyptians, so at the last time wonderful prodigies will take
place throughout all the elements of the world, by which the impending destruction may
be understood by all nations.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the end of this world approaches, the condition of human affairs must
undergo a change, and through the prevalence of wickedness become worse; so that now
these times of ours, in which iniquity and impiety have increased even to the highest degree,
may be judged happy and almost golden in comparison of that incurable evil. For righteousness
will so decrease, and impiety, avarice, desire, and lust will so greatly increase, that if
there shall then happen to be any good men, they will be a prey to the wicked, and will be
harassed on all sides by the unrighteous; while the wicked alone will be in opulence, but the
good will be afflicted in all calumnies and in want. All justice will be confounded, and the
laws will be destroyed. No one will then have anything except that which has been gained
or defended by the hand: boldness and violence will possess all things. There will be no faith
among men, nor peace, nor kindness, nor shame, nor truth; and thus also there will be
neither security, nor government, nor any rest from evils. For all the earth will be in a state
of tumult; wars will everywhere rage; all nations will be in arms, and will oppose one another;
neighbouring states will carry on conflicts with each other; and first of all, Egypt will pay
the penalties of her foolish superstitions, and will be covered with blood as if with a river.
Then the sword will traverse the world, mowing down everything, and laying low all things
as a crop. And—my mind dreads to relate it, but I will relate it, because it is about to hap-

<pb n="471"/>
pen—the cause of this desolation and confusion will be this; because the Roman name, by
which the world is now ruled, will be taken away from the earth, and the government return
to Asia; and the East will again bear rule, and the West be reduced to servitude.1387 Nor
ought it to appear wonderful to any one, if a kingdom founded with such vastness, and so
long increased by so many and such men, and in short strengthened by such great resources,
shall nevertheless at some time fall. There is nothing prepared by human strength which
cannot equally he destroyed by human strength, since the works of mortals are mortal. Thus
also other kingdoms in former times, though they had long flourished, were nevertheless
destroyed. For it is related that the Egyptians, and Persians, and Greeks, and Assyrians had
the government of the world; and after the destruction of them all, the chief power came to
the Romans also. And inasmuch as they excel all other kingdoms in magnitude, with so
much greater an overthrow will they fall, because those buildings which are higher than
others have more weight for a downfall.1388</p>
<p>Seneca therefore not unskilfully divided the times of the Roman city by ages. For he
said that at first was its infancy under King Romulus, by whom Rome was brought into being,
and as it were educated; then its boyhood under the other kings, by whom it was increased
and fashioned with more numerous systems of instruction and institutions; but at length,
in the reign of Tarquinius, when now it had begun as it were to be grown up, it did not endure
slavery; and having thrown off the yoke of a haughty tyranny, it preferred to obey laws rather
than kings; and when its youth was terminated by the end of the Punic war, then at length
with confirmed strength it began to be manly.1389 For when Carthage was taken away, which
was long its rival in power, it stretched out its hands by land and sea over the whole world,
until, having subdued all kings and nations, when the materials1390 for war now failed, it
abused its strength, by which it destroyed itself. This was its first old age, when, lacerated
by civil wars and oppressed by intestine evil, it again fell back to the government of a single
ruler, as it were revolving to a second infancy.1391 For, having lost the liberty which it had
defended under the guidance and authority of Brutus, it so grew old, as though it had no
strength to support itself, unless it depended on the aid of its rulers. But if these things are
so, what remains, except that death follow old age? And that it will so come to pass, the
predictions of the prophets briefly announce under the cover1392 of other names, so that

no one can easily understand them. Nevertheless the Sibyls openly say that Rome is doomed
to perish, and that indeed by the judgment of God, because it held His name in hatred; and
being the enemy of righteousness, it destroyed the people who kept1393 the truth. Hystaspes
also, who was a very ancient king of the Medes, from whom also the river which is now
called Hydaspes received its name, handed down to the memory of posterity a wonderful
dream upon the interpretation of a boy who uttered divinations, announcing long before
the founding of the Trojan nation, that the Roman empire and name would be taken away
from the world.</p>

<p>But, test any one should think this incredible, I will show how it will come to pass. First,
the kingdom will be enlarged, and the chief power, dispersed among many and divided,1395
will be diminished. Then civil discords will perpetually be sown; nor will there be any rest
from deadly wars, until ten kings arise at the same time, who will divide the world, not to
govern, but to consume it. These, having increased their armies to an immense extent, and
having deserted the cultivation of the fields, which is the beginning of overthrow and disaster,
will lay waste and break in pieces and consume all things. Then a most powerful enemy will
suddenly arise against him from the extreme boundaries of the northern region, who, having
destroyed three of that number who shall then be in possession of Asia, shall be admitted
into alliance by the others, and shall be constituted prince of all. He shall harass the world
with an intolerable rule; shall mingle things divine and human; shall contrive things impious
to relate, and detestable; shall meditate new designs in his breast, that he may establish the
government for himself: he will change the laws, and appoint his own; he will contaminate,
plunder, spoil, and put to death. And at length, the name being changed and the seat of
government being transferred, confusion and the disturbance of mankind will follow. Then,
in truth, a detestable and abominable time shall come, in which life shall be pleasant to none
of men.</p>
<p>Cities shall be utterly overthrown, and shall perish; not only by fire and the sword, but
also by continual earthquakes and overflowings of waters, and by frequent diseases and repeated
famines. For the atmosphere will be tainted, and become corrupt and pestilential—at
one time by unseasonable rains, at another by barren drought, now by colds, and now by
excessive heats. Nor will the earth give its fruit to man: no field, or tree, or vine will produce
anything; but after they have given the greatest hope in the blossom, they will fail in the
fruit. Fountains also shall be dried up, together with the rivers; so that there shall not be a
sufficient supply for drinking; and waters shall be changed into blood or bitterness. On account
of these things, beasts shall fail on the land, and birds in the air, and fishes in the sea.
Wonderful prodigies also in heaven shall confound the minds of men with the greatest terrors,
and the trains of comets, and the darkness of the sun, and the colour of the moon, and the
gliding of the falling stars. Nor, however, will these things take place in the accustomed
manner; but there will suddenly appear stars unknown and unseen by the eyes; the sun will
be perpetually darkened, so that there will be scarcely any distinction between the night and
the day; the moon will now fail, not for three hours only, but overspread with perpetual

blood, will go through extraordinary movements, so that it will not be easy for man to ascertain
the courses of the heavenly bodies or the system of the times; for there will either be
summer in the winter, or winter in the summer. Then the year will be shortened, and the
month diminished, and the day contracted into a short space; and stars shall fall in great
numbers, so that all the heaven will appear dark without any lights. The loftiest mountains
also will fall, and be levelled with the plains; the sea will be rendered unnavigable.</p>
<p>And that nothing may be wanting to the evils of men and the earth, the trumpet shall
be heard from heaven, which the Sibyl foretells in this manner:—
<lg>
<l>“The trumpet from heaven shall utter its wailing voice.”</l>
</lg>
And then all shall tremble and quake at that mournful sound.1396 But then, through the
anger of God against the men who have not known righteousness, the sword and fire, famine
and disease, shall reign; and, above all things, fear always overhanging. Then they shall call
upon God, but He will not hear them; death shall be desired, but it will not come; not even
shall night give rest to their fear, nor shall sleep approach to their eyes, but anxiety and
watchfulness shall consume the souls of men; they shall deplore and lament, and gnash their
teeth; they shall congratulate the dead, and bewail the living. Through these and many other
evils there shall be desolation on the earth, and the world shall be disfigured and deserted,
which is thus expressed in the verses of the Sibyl:—
<lg>
<l>“The world shall be despoiled of beauty, through the destruction of men.”</l>
</lg>
For the human race will be so consumed, that scarcely the tenth part of men will be left; and
from whence a thousand had gone forth, scarcely a hundred will go forth. Of the worshippers
of God also, two parts will perish; and the third part, which shall have been proved, will remain.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF THE FALSE PROPHET, AND THE HARDSHIPS OF THE
RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS DESTRUCTION.</head>
<p>But I will more plainly set forth the manner in which this happens. When the close of
the times draws nigh, a great prophet shall be sent from God to turn men to the knowledge
of God, and he shall receive the power of doing wonderful things.1397 Wherever men shall
not hear him, he will shut up the heaven, and cause it to withhold its rains; he will turn their
water into blood, and torment them with thirst and hunger; and if any one shall endeavour
to injure him, fire shall come forth out of his mouth, and shall burn that man. By these
prodigies and powers he shall turn many to the worship of God; and when his works shall
be accomplished, another king shall arise out of Syria, born from an evil spirit, the overthrower
and destroyer of the human race, who shall destroy that which is left by the former evil,
together with himself. He shall fight against the prophet of God, and shall overcome, and
slay him, and shall suffer him to lie unburied; but after the third day he shall come to life
again; and while all look on and wonder, he shall be caught up into heaven. But that king
will not only be most disgraceful in himself, but he will also be a prophet of lies; and he will
constitute and call himself God, and will order himself to be worshipped as the Son of God;
and power will be given him to do signs and wonders, by the sight of which he may entice
men to adore him. He will command fire to come down from heaven, and the sun to stand
and leave his course, and an image to speak; and these things shall be done at his word,—by
which miracles1398 many even of the wise shall be enticed by him. Then he will attempt to
destroy the temple of God, and persecute the righteous people; and there will be distress
and tribulation,1399 such as there never has been from the beginning of the world.</p>
<p>As many as shall believe him and unite themselves to him, shall be marked by him as
sheep; but they who shall refuse his mark will either flee to the mountains, or, being seized,
will be slain with studied1400 tortures. He will also enwrap righteous men with the books
of the prophets, and thus burn them; and power will be given him to desolate1401 the whole
earth for forty-two months. That will be the time in which righteousness shall be cast out,
and innocence be hated; in which the wicked shall prey upon the good as enemies; neither
law, nor order, nor military discipline shall be preserved; no one shall reverence hoary locks,
nor recognise the duty of piety, nor pity sex or infancy; all things shall be confounded and

waste, as though by one common robbery. When these things shall so happen, then the
righteous and the followers of truth shall separate themselves from the wicked, and flee into
solitudes. And when he hears of this, the impious king, inflamed with anger, will come with
a great army, and bringing up all his forces, will surround all the mountain in which the
righteous shall be situated, that he may seize them. But they, when they shall see themselves
to be shut in on all sides and besieged, will call upon God with a loud voice, and implore
the aid of heaven; and God shall hear them, and send from heaven a great king to rescue
and free them, and destroy all the wicked with fire and sword.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF THE FORTUNES OF THE WORLD AT THE LAST TIME, AND
OF THE THINGS FORETOLD BY THE SOOTHSAYERS.</head>
<p>That these things will thus take place, all the prophets have announced from the inspiration
of God, and also the soothsayers at the instigation of the demons. For Hystaspes, whom
I have named above, having described the iniquity of this last time, says that the pious and
faithful, being separated from the wicked, will stretch forth their hands to heaven with
weeping and mourning, and will implore the protection of Jupiter: that Jupiter will look to
the earth, and hear the voices of men, and will destroy the wicked. All which things are true
except one, that he attributed to Jupiter those things which God will do. But that also was
withdrawn from the account, not without fraud on the part of the demons, viz., that the Son
of God would then be sent, who, having destroyed all the wicked, would set at liberty the
pious. Which, however, Hermes did not conceal. For in that book which is entitled the
Complete Treatise, after an enumeration of the evils concerning which we have spoken, he
added these things: “But when these things thus come to pass, then He who is Lord, and
Father, and God, and the Creator of the first and one God, looking upon what is done, and
opposing to the disorder His own will, that is, goodness, and recalling the wandering and
cleansing wickedness, partly inundating it with much water, and partly burning it with most
rapid fire, and sometimes pressing it with wars and pestilences, He brought His world to
its ancient state and restored it.” The Sibyls also show that it would not be otherwise than
that the Son of God should be sent by His supreme Father, to set free the righteous from
the hands of the wicked, and to destroy the unrighteous, together with their cruel tyrants.
One of whom thus wrote:—
<lg>
<l>“He shall come also, wishing to destroy the city of the blest; and a king sent
against him from the gods shall slay all the great kings and chief men:
then judgment shall thus come from the Immortal to men.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Also another Sibyl:—
<lg>
<l>“And then God shall send a king from the sun, who shall cause all the earth to
cease from disastrous war.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And again another:—
<lg>
<l>“He will take away the intolerable yoke of slavery which is placed on our neck,
and he will do away with impious laws and violent chains.”</l>
</lg>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE ADVENT OF CHRIST TO JUDGMENT, AND OF THE
OVERCOMING OF THE FALSE PROPHET.</head>
<p>The world therefore being oppressed, since the resources of men shall be insufficient
for the overthrow of a tyranny of immense strength, inasmuch as it will press upon the
captive world with great armies of robbers, that calamity so great will stand in need of divine
assistance. Therefore God, being aroused both by the doubtful danger and by the wretched
lamentation of the righteous, will immediately send a deliverer. Then the middle of the
heaven shall be laid open in the dead and darkness of the night, that the light of the descending
God may be manifest in all the world as lightning: of which the Sibyl spoke in these
words:—
<lg>
<l>“When He shall come, there will be fire and darkness in the midst of the black
night.”</l>
</lg>
This is the night which is celebrated by us in watchfulness on account of the coming of our
King and God:1402 of which night there is a twofold meaning; because in it He then received
life when He suffered, and hereafter He is about to receive the kingdom of the world. For
He is the Deliverer, and Judge, and Avenger, and King, and God, whom we call Christ, who
before He descends will give this sign: There shall suddenly fall from heaven a sword, that
the righteous may know that the leader of the sacred warfare is about to descend; and He
shall descend with a company of angels to the middle of the earth, and there shall go before
Him an unquenchable fire, and the power of the angels shall deliver into the hands of the
just that multitude which has surrounded the mountain, and they shall be slain from the
third hour until the evening, and blood shall flow like a torrent; and all his forces being
destroyed, the wicked one shall alone escape, and his power shall perish from him.</p>
<p>Now this is he who is called Antichrist; but he shall falsely call himself Christ, and shall
fight against the truth, and being overcome shall flee; and shall often renew the war, and
often be conquered, until in the fourth battle, all the wicked being slain, subdued, and captured,
he shall at length pay the penalty of his crimes. But other princes also and tyrants
who have harassed the world, together with him, shall be led in chains to the king; and he
shall rebuke them, and reprove them, and upbraid them with their crimes, and condemn
them, and consign them to deserved tortures. Thus, wickedness being extinguished and
impiety suppressed, the world will be at rest, which having been subject to error and
wickedness for so many ages, endured dreadful slavery. No longer shall gods made by the
hands be worshipped; but the images being thrust out from their temples and couches, shall

be given to the fire, and shall be burnt, together with their wonderful gifts: which also the
Sibyl, in accordance with the prophets, announced as about to take place:—
<lg>
<l>“But mortals shall break in pieces the images and all the wealth.”</l>
</lg>
The Erythræan Sibyl also made the same promise:—
<lg>
<l>“And the works made by the hand of the gods shall be burnt up.”</l>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="480"/>
<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE JUDGMENT OF CHRIST, OF CHRISTIANS, AND OF THE
SOUL.</head>
<p>After these things the lower regions shall be opened, and the dead shall rise again, on
whom the same King and God shall pass judgment, to whom the supreme Father shall give
the great power both of judging and of reigning. And respecting this judgment and reign,
it is thus found in the Erythræan Sibyl:—
<lg>
<l>“When this shall receive its fated accomplishment, and the judgment of the immortal
God shall now come to mortals, the great judgment shall come
upon men, and the beginning.”</l>
</lg>
Then in another:—
<lg>
<l>“And then the gaping earth shall show a Tartarean chaos; and all kings shall
come to the judgment-seat of God.”</l>
</lg>
And in another place in the same:—
<lg>
<l>“Rolling along the heavens, I will open the caverns of the earth; and then I will
raise the dead, loosing fate and the sting of death; and afterwards I will
call them into judgment, judging the life of pious and impious men.”</l>
</lg>
Not all men, however, shall then be judged by God, but those only who have been exercised
in the religion of God. For they who have not known God, since sentence cannot be passed
upon them for their acquittal, are already judged and condemned, since the Holy Scriptures
testify that the wicked shall not arise to judgment.1403 Therefore they who have known God
shall be judged, and their deeds, that is, their evil works, shall be compared and weighed
against their good ones: so that if those which are good and just are more1404 and weighty,
they may be given to a life of blessedness; but if the evil exceed, they may be condemned to
punishment. Here, perhaps, some one will say, If the soul is immortal, how is it represented
as capable of suffering, and sensible of punishment? For if it shall be punished on account
of its deserts, it is plain that it will be sensible of pain, and even of death. If it is not liable to
death, not even to pain, it follows that it is not capable of suffering.</p>
<note type="footnote">1403 The reference is to Ps. i. 5: “The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment.” They shall indeed arise, but
it will be to “the resurrection of damnation.” See Dan. xii. 2; John v. 28, 29; Acts xxiv. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1404 Good and bad actions will not be compared by reference to number: “For whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”—Jas. ii. 10. [The figure, however, is not dissimilar in
Job xxxi. 6. We must be judged by our works, though saved by faith in Christ.]</note>

<pb n="481"/>
<p>This question or argument is thus met by the Stoics: that the souls of men continue to
exist, and are not annihilated1405 by the intervention of death: that the souls, moreover, of
those who have been just, being pure, and incapable of suffering, and happy, return to the
heavenly abodes from which they had their origin, or are borne to some happy plains, where
they may enjoy wonderful pleasures; but that the wicked, since they have defiled themselves
with evil passions, have a kind of middle nature, between that of an immortal and a mortal,
and have something of weakness, from the contagion of the flesh; and being enslaved to its
desires and lusts, they contract an indelible stain and earthly blot; and when this has become
entirely inherent through length of time, souls are given over to its nature, so that, though
they cannot altogether be extinguished, inasmuch as they are from God, nevertheless they
become liable to torment through the taint of the body, which being burnt in by means of
sins, produces a feeling of pain. Which sentiment is thus expressed by the poet:1406—
<lg>
<l>“Nay, when at last the life has fled,</l>
<l>And left the body cold and dead,</l>
<l>E’en then there passes not away</l>
<l>The painful heritage of clay:</l>
<l>Full many a long contracted stain</l>
<l>Perforce must linger deep in grain.</l>
<l>So penal sufferings they endure</l>
<l>For ancient crime, to make them pure.”</l>
</lg>
These things are near to the truth.1407 For the soul, when separated from the body, is, as
the same poet says,1408 such as
<lg>
<l>“No vision of the drowsy night,</l>
<l>No airy current half so light,”</l>
</lg>
because it is a spirit, and by its very slightness incapable of being perceived, but only by us
who are corporeal but capable of being perceived by God, since it belongs to Him to be able
to do all things.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF THE TORMENTS AND PUNISHMENTS OF SOULS.</head>
<p>First of all, therefore, we say that the power of God is so great, that He perceives even
incorporeal things, and manages them as He will. For even angels fear God, because they
can be chastised by Him in some unspeakable manner; and devils dread Him, because they
are tormented and punished by Him. What wonder is it, therefore, if souls, though they are
immortal, are nevertheless capable of suffering at the hand of God? For since they have
nothing solid and tangible in themselves, they can suffer no violence from solid and corporeal
beings; but because they live in their spirits only, they are capable of being handled by God
alone, whose energy and substance is spiritual. But, however, the sacred writings inform us
in what manner the wicked are to undergo punishment. For because they have committed
sins in their bodies, they will again be clothed with flesh, that they may make atonement in
their bodies; and yet it will not be that flesh with which God clothed man, like this our
earthly body, but indestructible, and abiding for ever, that it may be able to hold out against
tortures and everlasting fire, the nature of which is different from this fire of ours, which
we use for the necessary purposes of life, and which is extinguished unless it be sustained
by the fuel of some material. But that divine fire always lives by itself, and flourishes without
any nourishment; nor has it any smoke mixed with it, but it is pure and liquid, and fluid,
after the manner of water. For it is not urged upwards by any force, as our fire, which the
taint of the earthly body, by which it is held, and smoke intermingled, compels to leap forth,
and to fly upwards to the nature of heaven, with a tremulous movement.1409</p>
<p>The same divine fire, therefore, with one and the same force and power, will both burn
the wicked and will form them again, and will replace as much as it shall consume of their
bodies, and will supply itself with eternal nourishment: which the poets transferred to the
vulture of Tityus. Thus, without any wasting of bodies, which regain their substance, it will
only burn and affect them with a sense of pain. But when He shall have judged the righteous,
He will also try them with fire. Then they whose sins shall exceed either in weight or in
number, shall be scorched by the fire and burnt:1410 but they whom full justice and maturity
of virtue has imbued will not perceive that fire; for they have something of God in themselves
which repels and rejects the violence of the flame. So great is the force of innocence, that
the flame shrinks from it without doing harm; which has received from God this power,
that it burns the wicked, and is under the command of the righteous. Nor, however, let any
one imagine that souls are immediately judged after death. For all are detained in one and
a common place of confinement, until the arrival of the time in which the great Judge shall

make an investigation of their deserts.1411 Then they whose piety shall have been approved
of will receive the reward of immortality; but they whose sins and crimes shall have been

being destined to certain punishment.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF THE ERROR OF THE POETS, AND THE RETURN OF THE SOUL
FROM THE LOWER REGIONS.</head>
<p>Some imagine that these things are figments of the poets, not knowing whence the poets
received them, and they say that these things are impossible; and it is no wonder that it so
appears to them. For the matter is related by the poets in a manner which is different from
the truth; for although they are much more ancient than the historians and orators, and
other kinds of writers, yet because they were ignorant of the secret of the divine mystery,
and mention of a future resurrection had reached them by an obscure rumour, yet they
handed it down, when carelessly and lightly heard, after the manner of a feigned story. And
yet they also testified that they did not follow a sure authority, but mere opinion, as Maro,
who says,1412
<lg>
<l>“What ear has heard let tongue make known.”</l>
</lg>
Although, therefore, they have partly corrupted the secrets of the truth, yet the matter itself
is found to be more true, because it partly agrees with the prophets: which is sufficient for
us as a proof of the matter. Yet some reason is contained in their error. For when the
prophets proclaimed with continual announcements that the Son of God was about to judge
the dead, and this announcement did not escape their notice; inasmuch as they supposed
that there was no other ruler of heaven but Jupiter, they reported that the son of Jupiter was
king in the lower regions, but not Apollo, or Liber, or Mercurius, who are supposed to be
gods of heaven, but one who was both mortal and just, either Minos, or Æacus, or
Rhadamanthus. Therefore with poetic licence they corrupted that which they had received;
or, the opinion being scattered through different mouths and various discourses, changed
the truth. For inasmuch as they foretold that, when a thousand years had been passed in
the lower regions, they should again be restored to life, as Maro said:1413—
<lg>
<l>“All these, when centuries ten times told</l>
<l>The wheel of destiny have rolled,</l>
<l>The voice divine from far and wide</l>
<l>Calls up to Lethe’s river side,</l>
<l>That earthward they may pass once more,</l>
<l>Remembering not the things before,</l>
<l>And with a blind propension yearn</l>
<l>To fleshly bodies to return:”</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">1412 Virg., Æn., vi. 266.</note>
<note type="footnote">1413 Ibid., 748.</note>

<pb n="485"/>
this matter escaped their notice, that the dead will rise again, not after a thousand years
from their death, but that, when again restored to life, they may reign with God a thousand
years. For God will come, that, having cleansed the world from all defilement, He may restore
the souls of the righteous to their renewed bodies, and raise them to everlasting blessedness.
Therefore the other things are true, except the water of oblivion, which they feigned on this
account, that no one might make this objection: why, therefore, did they not remember that
they were at one time alive, or who they were, or what things they accomplished? But nevertheless
it is not thought probable, and the whole matter is rejected, as though licentiously
and fabulously invented. But when we affirm the doctrine of the resurrection, and teach
that souls will return to another life, not forgetful of themselves, but possessed of the same
perception and figure, we are met with this objection: So many ages have now passed; what
individual ever arose from the dead, that through his example we may believe it to be possible?
But the resurrection cannot take place while unrighteousness still prevails. For in this
world men are slain by violence, by the sword, by ambush, by poisons, and are visited with
injuries, with want, with imprisonment, with tortures, and with proscriptions. Add to this
that righteousness is hated, that all who wish to follow God are not only held in hatred, but
are harassed with all reproaches, and are tormented by manifold kinds of punishments, and
are driven to the impious worship of gods made with hands, not by reason or truth, but by
dreadful laceration of their bodies.</p>
<p>Ought men therefore to rise again to these same things, or to return to a life in which
it is impossible for them to be safe? Since the righteous, then, are so lightly esteemed, and
so easily taken away, what can we suppose would have happened if any one returning from
the dead had recovered life by a recovery1414 of his former condition? He would assuredly
be taken away from the eyes of men, lest, if he were seen or heard, all men with one accord
should leave the gods and betake themselves to the worship and religion of the one God.
Therefore it is necessary that the resurrection should take place once only when evil shall
have been taken away, since it is befitting that those who have risen again should neither
die any more, nor be injured in any way, that they may be able to pass a happy life whose
death has been annulled.1415 But the poets, knowing that this life abounds with all evils,
introduced the river of oblivion, lest the souls, remembering their labours and evils, should
refuse to return to the upper regions; whence Virgil says:1416—
<lg>
<l>“O Father! and can thought conceive</l>
<l>That happy souls this realm would leave,</l>
<l>And seek the upper sky,</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">1414 Postliminio. For the uses of this word, see Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</note>
<note type="footnote">1415 Resignata est, properly “unsealed.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1416 Virg., Æn., vi. 719.</note>

<pb n="486"/>
<lg>
<l>With sluggish clay to reunite?</l>
<l>This dreadful longing for the light,</l>
<l>Whence comes it, say, and why?”</l>
</lg>
For they did not know how or when it must take place; and therefore they supposed that
souls were born again, and that they returned afresh to the womb, and went back to infancy.
Whence also Plato, while discussing the nature of the soul, says that it may be known from
this that souls are immortal and divine, because in boys minds are pliant, and easy of perception,
and because they so quickly comprehend the subjects which they learn, that they
appear not then to be learning for the first time, but to be recalling them to mind and recollecting
them: in which matter the wise man most foolishly believed the poets.</p>

<pb n="487"/>
<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE SOUL, AND THE PROOFS OF
THIS FACT.</head>
<p>Therefore they will not be born again, which is impossible, but they will rise again, and
be clothed by God with bodies, and will remember their former life, and all its actions; and
being placed in the possession of heavenly goods, and enjoying the pleasure of innumerable
resources, they will give thanks to God in His immediate presence, because He has destroyed
all evil, and because He has raised them to His kingdom and to perpetual life. Respecting
which resurrection the philosophers also attempted to speak as corruptly as the poets. For
Pythagoras asserted that souls passed into new bodies; but foolishly, that they passed from
men into cattle, and from cattle into men; and that he himself was restored from Euphorbus.
Chrysippus says better, whom Cicero speaks of as supporting the portico of the Stoics, who,
in the books which he wrote concerning providence, when he was speaking of the renewing
of the world, introduced these words: “But since this is so, it is evident that nothing is impossible,
and that we, after our death, when certain periods of time have again come round,
are restored to this state in which we now are.” But let us return from human to divine
things. The Sibyl thus speaks:—
<lg>
<l>“For the whole race of mortals is hard to be believed; but when the judgment of
the world and of mortals shall now come, which God Himself shall
institute, judging the impious and the holy at the same time, then at
length He shall send the wicked to darkness in fire. But as many as are
holy shall live again on the earth, God giving them at the same time a
spirit, and honour, and life.”</l>
</lg>
But if not only prophets, but even bards, and poets, and philosophers, agree that there will
be a resurrection of the dead, let no one ask of us how this is possible: for no reason can be
assigned for divine works; but if from the beginning God formed man in some unspeakable
manner, we may believe that the old man can be restored by Him who made the new man.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<pb n="488"/>
<head>CHAP. XXIV.—OF THE RENEWED WORLD.</head>
<p>Now I will subjoin the rest. Therefore the Son of the most high and mighty God shall
come to judge the quick and the dead, as the Sibyl testifies and says:—
<lg>
<l>“For then there shall be confusion of mortals throughout the whole earth, when
the Almighty Himself shall come on His judgment-seat to judge the
souls of the quick and dead, and all the world.”</l>
</lg>
But He, when He shall have destroyed unrighteousness, and executed His great judgment,
and shall have recalled to life the righteous, who have lived from the beginning, will be engaged
among men a thousand years, and will rule them with most just command. Which
the Sibyl proclaims in another place, as she utters her inspired predictions:—
<lg>
<l>“Hear me, ye mortals; an everlasting King reigns.”</l>
</lg>
Then they who shall be alive in their bodies shall not die, but during those thousand years
shall produce an infinite multitude, and their offspring shall be holy, and beloved by God;
but they who shall be raised from the dead shall preside over the living as judges.1417 But
the nations shall not be entirely extinguished, but some shall be left as a victory for God,
that they may be the occasion of triumph to the righteous, and may be subjected to perpetual
slavery. About the same time also the prince of the devils, who is the contriver of all evils,
shall be bound with chains, and shall be imprisoned during the thousand years of the
heavenly rule in which righteousness shall reign in the world, so that he may contrive no
evil against the people of God. After His coming the righteous shall be collected from all
the earth, and the judgment being completed, the sacred city shall be planted in the middle
of the earth, in which God Himself the builder may dwell together with the righteous,
bearing rule in it. And the Sibyl marks out this city when she says:—
<lg>
<l>“And the city which God made, this He made more brilliant than the stars, and
sun, and moon.”</l>
</lg>
Then that darkness will be taken away from the world with which the heaven will be overspread
and darkened, and the moon will receive the brightness of the sun, nor will it be
further diminished: but the sun will become seven times brighter than it now is; and the
earth will open its fruitfulness, and bring forth most abundant fruits of its own accord; the
rocky mountains shall drop with honey; streams of wine shall run down, and rivers flow
with milk: in short, the world itself shall rejoice, and all nature exult, being rescued and set
<note type="footnote">1417 [This is “the first resurrection” as conceived of by the ancients, and the (Phil. iii. 11) ἐξανάστασις of St.
Paul.]</note>

<pb n="489"/>
free from the dominion of evil and impiety, and guilt and error. Throughout this time beasts
shall not be nourished by blood, nor birds by prey; but all things shall be peaceful and
tranquil. Lions and calves shall stand together at the manger, the wolf shall not carry off the
sheep, the hound shall not hunt for prey; hawks and eagles shall not injure; the infant shall
play with serpents. In short, those things shall then come to pass which the poets spoke of
as being done in the reign of Saturnus. Whose error arose from this source,—that the
prophets bring forward and speak of many future events as already accomplished. For visions
were brought before their eyes by the divine Spirit, and they saw these things, as it were,
done and completed in their own sight. And when fame had gradually spread abroad their
predictions, since those who were uninstructed in the mysteries1418 of religion did not know
why they were spoken, they thought that all those things were already fulfilled in the ancient
ages, which evidently could not be accomplished and fulfilled under the reign of a man.1419
But when, after the destruction of impious religions and the suppression of guilt, the earth
shall be subject to God,—
<lg>
<l>“The sailor1420 himself also shall renounce the sea, nor shall the naval pine</l>
<l>Barter merchandise; all lands shall produce all things.</l>
<l>The ground shall not endure the harrow, nor the vineyard the pruning hook;</l>
<l>The sturdy ploughman also shall loose the bulls from the yoke.</l>
<l>The plain shall by degrees grow yellow with soft ears of corn,</l>
<l>The blushing grape shall hang on the uncultivated brambles,</l>
<l>And hard oaks shall distil the dewy honey.</l>
<l>Nor shall the wool learn to counterfeit various colours;</l>
<l>But the ram himself in the meadows shall change his fleece,</l>
<l>Now for a sweetly blushing purple, now for saffron dye;</l>
<l>Scarlet of its own accord shall cover the lambs as they feed.</l>
<l>The goats of themselves shall bring back home their udders distended with milk;</l>
<l>Nor shall the herds dread huge lions.”1421</l>
</lg>
Which things the poet foretold according to the verses of the Cumæan Sibyl. But the
Erythræan thus speaks:—
<note type="footnote">1418 Profani a sacramentis.</note>
<note type="footnote">1419 [This rationale of the Orphica and Sibyllina deserves thought.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1420 Vector, i.e., the passenger, as opposed to one who sails in a ship of war.</note>

<pb n="490"/>
<lg>
<l>“But wolves shall not contend with lambs on the mountains, and lynxes shall
eat grass with kids; boars shall feed with calves, and with all flocks;
and the carnivorous lion shall eat chaff at the manger, and serpents
shall sleep with infants deprived of their mothers.”</l>
</lg>
And in another place, speaking of the fruitfulness of all things:—
<lg>
<l>“And then shall God give great joy to men; for the earth, and the trees, and the
numberless flocks of the earth shall give to men the true fruit of the
vine, and sweet honey, and white milk, and corn, which is the best of
all things to mortals.”</l>
</lg>
And another in the same manner:—
<lg>
<l>“The sacred land of the pious only will produce all these things, the stream of
honey from the rock and from the fountain, and the milk of ambrosia
will flow for all the just.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Therefore men will live a most tranquil life, abounding with resources, and will reign
together with God; and the kings of the nations shall come from the ends of the earth with
gifts and offerings, to adore and honour the great King, whose name shall be renowned and
venerated by all the nations which shall be under heaven, and by the kings who shall rule
on earth.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXV.—OF THE LAST TIMES, AND OF THE CITY OF ROME.</head>
<p>These are the things which are spoken of by the prophets as about to happen hereafter:
but I have not considered it necessary to bring forward their testimonies and words, since
it would be an endless task; nor would the limits of my book receive so great a multitude of
subjects, since so many with one breath speak similar things; and at the same time, lest
weariness should be occasioned to the readers if I should heap together things collected and
transferred from all; moreover, that I might confirm those very things which I said, not by
my own writings, but in an especial manner by the writings of others, and might show that
not only among us, but even with those very persons who revile us, the truth is preserved,1422
which they refuse to acknowledge.1423 But he who wishes to know these things more accurately
may draw from the fountain itself, and he will know more things worthy of admiration
than we have comprised in these books. Perhaps some one may now ask when these things
of which we have spoken are about to come to pass? I have already shown above, that when
six thousand years shall be completed this change must take place, and that the last day of
the extreme conclusion is now drawing near. It is permitted us to know respecting the signs,
which are spoken by the prophets, for they foretold signs by which the consummation of
the times is to be expected by us from day to day, and to be feared. When, however, this
amount will be completed, those teach, who have written respecting the times, collecting
them from the sacred writings and from various histories, how great is the number of years
from the beginning of the world. And although they vary, and the amount of the number
as reckoned by them differs considerably, yet all expectation does not exceed the limit of
two hundred years. The subject itself declares that the fall and ruin of the world will shortly
take place; except that while the city of Rome remains it appears that nothing of this kind
is to be feared.1424 But when that capital of the world shall have fallen, and shall have begun
to be a street,1425 which the Sibyls say shall come to pass, who can doubt that the end has
now arrived to the affairs of men and the whole world? It is that city, that only, which still
sustains all things; and the God of heaven is to be entreated by us and implored—if, indeed,
His arrangements and decrees can be delayed—lest, sooner than we think for, that detestable
tyrant should come who will undertake so great a deed, and dig out that eye, by the destruction
of which the world itself is about to fall. Now let us return, to set forth the other things
which are then about to follow.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVI.—OF THE LOOSING OF THE DEVIL, AND OF THE SECOND AND
GREATEST JUDGMENT.</head>
<p>We have said, a little before, that it will come to pass at the commencement of the sacred
reign, that the prince of the devils will be bound by God. But he also, when the thousand
years of the kingdom, that is, seven thousand of the world, shall begin to be ended, will be
loosed afresh, and being sent forth from prison, will go forth and assemble all the nations,
which shall then be under the dominion of the righteous, that they may make war against
the holy city; and there shall be collected together from all the world an innumerable company
of the nations, and shall besiege and surround the city. Then the last anger of God shall
come upon the nations, and shall utterly1426 destroy them; and first He shall shake the earth
most violently, and by its motion the mountains of Syria shall be rent, and the hills shall
sink down precipitously, and the walls of all cities shall fall, and God shall cause the sun to
stand, so that he set not for three days, and shall set it on fire; and excessive heat and great
burning shall descend upon the hostile and impious people, and showers of brimstone, and
hailstones, and drops of fire; and their spirits shall melt through the heat, and their bodies
shall be bruised by the hail, and they shall smite one another with the sword. The mountains
shall be filled with carcases, and the plains shall be covered with bones; but the people of
God during those three days shall be concealed under caves of the earth, until the anger of
God against the nations and the last judgment shall be ended.</p>
<p>Then the righteous shall go forth from their hiding-places, and shall find all things
covered with carcases and bones. But the whole race of the wicked shall utterly perish; and
there shall no longer be any nation in this world, but the nation of God alone. Then for
seven continuous years the woods shall be untouched, nor shall timber be cut from the
mountains, but the arms of the nations shall be burnt; and now there shall be no war, but
peace and everlasting rest. But when the thousand years shall be completed, the world shall
be renewed by God, and the heavens shall be folded together, and the earth shall be changed,
and God shall transform men into the similitude of angels, and they shall be white as snow;
and they shall always be employed in the sight of the Almighty, and shall make offerings to
their Lord, and serve Him for ever. At the same time shall take place that second and public
resurrection1427 of all, in which the unrighteous shall be raised to everlasting punishments.
These are they who have worshipped the works of their own hands, who have either been
ignorant of, or have denied the Lord and Parent of the world. But their lord with his servants
shall be seized and condemned to punishment, together with whom all the band of the
wicked, in accordance with their deeds, shall be burnt for ever with perpetual fire in the
sight of angels and the righteous.</p>

<p>This is the doctrine of the holy prophets which we Christians follow; this is our wisdom,
which they who worship frail objects, or maintain an empty philosophy, deride as folly and
vanity, because we are not accustomed to defend and assert it in public, since God orders
us in quietness and silence to hide His secret, and to keep it within our own conscience; and
not to strive with obstinate contention against those who are ignorant of the truth, and who
rigorously assail God and His religion not for the sake of learning, but of censuring and
jeering. For a mystery ought to be most faithfully concealed and covered, especially by us,
who bear the name of faith.1428 But they accuse this silence of ours, as though it were the
result of an evil conscience; whence also they invent some detestable things respecting those
who are holy and blameless, and willingly believe their own inventions.

<p>But all fictions have now been hushed, most holy Emperor, since the time when the
great God raised thee up for the restoration of the house of justice, and for the protection
of the human race; for while thou rulest the Roman state, we worshippers of God are no
more regarded as accursed and impious. Since the truth now comes forth1429 from obscurity,
and is brought into light, we are not censured as unrighteous who endeavour to perform
the works of righteousness. No one any longer reproaches us with the name of God. None
of us, who are alone of all men religious, is any more called irreligious; since despising the
images of the dead, we worship the living and true God. The providence of the supreme
Deity has raised thee to the imperial dignity, that thou mightest be able with true piety to
rescind the injurious decrees of others, to correct faults, to provide with a father’s clemency
for the safety of men,—in short, to remove the wicked from the state, whom being cast down
by pre-eminent piety, God has delivered into your hands, that it might be evident to all in
what true majesty consists.</p>
<p>For they who wished to take away the worship of the heavenly and matchless1430 God,
that they might defend impious superstitions, lie in ruin.1431 But thou, who defendest and
lovest His name, excelling in virtue and prosperity, enjoyest thy immortal glories with the
greatest happiness. They suffer and have suffered the punishment of their guilt. The
powerful right hand of God protects thee from all dangers; He bestows on thee a quiet and

tranquil reign, with the highest congratulations of all men. And not undeservedly has the
Lord and Ruler of the world chosen thee in preference to all others, by whom He might renew
His holy religion, since thou alone didst exist of all, who mightest afford a surpassing example
of virtue and holiness: in which thou mightest not only equal, but also, which is a very great
matter, excel the glory of ancient princes, whom nevertheless fame reckons among the good.
They indeed perhaps by nature only resembled the righteous. For he who is ignorant of
God, the Ruler of the universe, may attain to a resemblance of righteousness, but he cannot
attain to righteousness itself. But thou, both by the innate sanctity of thy character, and by
thy acknowledgment of the truth and of God in every action, dost fully perform1432 the
works of righteousness.1433 It was therefore befitting that, in arranging the condition of the
human race, the Deity should make use of thy authority and service. Whom we supplicate
with daily prayers, that He may especially guard thee whom He has wished to be the
guardian of the world: then that He may inspire thee with a disposition by which thou
mayest always continue in the love of the divine name. For this is serviceable to all, both to
thee for happiness, and to others for repose.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVII.—AN ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONFIRMATION OF THE PIOUS.</head>
<p>Since we have completed the seven courses1434 of the work which we undertook, and
have advanced to the goal, it remains that we exhort all to undertake wisdom together with
true religion, the strength and office of which depends on this, that, despising earthly things,
and laying aside the errors by which we were formerly held while we served frail things, and
desired frail things, we may be directed to the eternal rewards of the heavenly treasure. And
that we may obtain these, the alluring pleasures of the present life must as soon as possible
be laid aside, which soothe the souls of men with pernicious sweetness. How great a happiness
must it be thought, to be withdrawn from these stains of the earth, and to go to that most
just Judge and indulgent Father, who in the place of labours gives rest, in the place of death
life, in the place of darkness brightness, and in the place of short and earthly goods, gives
those which are eternal and heavenly: with which reward the hardships and miseries which
we endure in this world, in accomplishing the works of righteousness, can in no way be
compared and equalled. Therefore, if we wish to be wise and happy, not only must those
sayings of Terence be reflected upon and proposed to us,
<lg>
<l>“That we must ever grind at the mill, we must be beaten, and put in fetters;”1435</l>
</lg>
but things much more dreadful than these must be endured, namely, the prison, chains,
and tortures: pains must be undergone, in short, death itself must be undertaken and borne,
when it is clear to our conscience that that frail pleasure will not be without punishment,
nor virtue without a divine reward. All, therefore, ought to endeavour either to direct
themselves to the right way as soon as possible, or, having undertaken and exercised virtues,
and having patiently performed the labours of this life, to deserve to have God as their
comforter. For our Father and Lord, who built and strengthened the heaven, who placed in
it the sun, with the other heavenly bodies, who by His power weighed the earth and fenced
it with mountains, surrounded it with the sea, and divided it with rivers, and who made and
completed out of nothing whatever there is in this workmanship of the world; having observed
the errors of men, sent a Guide, who might open to us the way of righteousness: let
us all follow Him, let us hear Him, let us obey Him with the greatest devotedness, since He
alone, as Lucretius says,1436

fear, and explained what was the chief good which we all strive to</l>

might arrive at it in a straightforward course.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And not only pointed it out, but also went before us in it, that no one might dread the
path of virtue on account of its difficulty. Let the way of destruction and deceit, if it is possible,
be deserted, in which death is concealed, being covered by the attractions of pleasure.</p>
<p>And the more nearly each one, as his years incline to old age, sees to be the approach
of that day in which he must depart from this life, let him reflect how he may leave it in
purity, how he may come to the Judge in innocency; not as they do, to whose dark minds
the light is denied,1437 who, when the strength of their body now fails, are admonished in
this of the last pressing necessity, that they should with greater eagerness and ardour apply
themselves to the satisfying of their lusts. From which abyss let everyone free himself while
it is permitted him, while the opportunity is present, and let him turn himself to God with
his whole mind, that he may without anxiety await that day, in which God, the Ruler and
Lord of the world, shall judge the deeds and thoughts of each. Whatever things are here
desired, let him not only neglect, but also avoid them, and let him judge that his soul is of
greater value than those deceitful goods, the possession of which is uncertain and transitory;
for they take their departure every day, and they go forth much more quickly than they had
entered, and if it is permitted us to enjoy them even to the last, they must still, without doubt,
be left to others. We can take nothing with us, except a well and innocently spent life. That
man will appear before God with abundant resources, that man will appear in opulence, to
whom there shall belong self-restraint, mercy, patience, love, and faith. This is our inherit-
ance, which can neither be taken away from any one, nor transferred to another. And who
is there who would wish to provide and acquire for himself these goods?</p>
<p>Let those who are hungry come, that being fed with heavenly food, they may lay aside
their lasting hunger; let those who are athirst come, that they may with full mouth draw
forth the water of salvation from an ever-flowing fountain.1438 By this divine food and drink
the blind shall both see, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak, and the lame walk, and the
foolish shall be wise, and the sick shall be strong, and the dead shall come to life again. For
whoever by his virtue has trampled upon the corruptions of the earth, the supreme and
truthful arbiter will raise him to life and to perpetual light. Let no one trust in riches, no
one in badges of authority, no one even in royal power: these things do not make a man
immortal. For whosoever shall cast away the conduct becoming a man,1439 and, following

which will alone, as an inseparable companion, lead us to God; and “while a spirit rules
these limbs,”1440 let us serve God with unwearied service, let us keep our posts and watches,
let us boldly engage with the enemy whom we know, that victorious and triumphant over
our conquered adversary, we may obtain from the Lord that reward of valour which He
Himself has promised.</p>

<head>THE PREFACE.—THE PLAN AND PURPORT OF THE WHOLE EPITOME,1441 AND
OF THE INSTITUTIONS.</head>
<p>Although the books of the Divine Institutions which we wrote a long time since to illustrate
the truth and religion, may so prepare and mould the minds of the readers, that their
length may not produce disgust, nor their copiousness be burthensome; nevertheless you
desire, O brother Pentadius, that an epitome of them should be made for you, I suppose for
this reason, that I may write something to you, and that your name may be rendered famous
by my work, such as it is. I will comply with your desire, although it seems a difficult matter
to comprise within the compass of one book those things which have been treated of in
seven large volumes.1442 For the whole matter becomes less full when so great a multitude
of subjects is to be compressed within a narrow space; and it becomes less clear by its very
brevity, especially since many arguments and examples, on which the elucidation of the
proofs depends, must of necessity be omitted, since their copiousness is so great, that even
by themselves they are enough to make up a book. And when these are removed, what can
appear useful, what plain? But I will strive as much as the subject permits, both to contract
that which is diffuse and to shorten that which is long; in such a manner, however, that in
this work, in which truth is to be brought to light, matter may not seem to be wanting for
copiousness, nor clearness for understanding it.1443</p>

<head>CHAP. I.—OF THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE.</head>
<p>First a question arises: Whether there is any providence which made or governs the
world? That there is, no one doubts, since of almost all the philosophers, except the school
of Epicurus, there is but one voice and one opinion, that the world could not have been
made without a contriver, and that it cannot exist without a ruler. Therefore Epicurus is
refuted not only by the most learned men, but also by the testimonies and perceptions of
all mortals. For who can doubt respecting a providence, when he sees that the heavens and
the earth have been so arranged and that all things have been so regulated, that they might
be most befittingly adapted, not only to wonderful beauty and adornment, but also to the
use of men, and the convenience of the other living creatures? That, therefore, which exists
in accordance with a plan, cannot have had its beginning without a plan: thus1444 it is certain
that there is a providence.</p>
<note type="footnote">1444 Quoniam. This word appears to be out of place, as its proper meaning is “since.” Either it must be taken
as above, or, with some editors, the last clause of this chapter may be taken as the beginning of the next
chapter—“Since there is a providence,” etc.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="501"/>
<head>CHAP. II.—THAT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE
MORE.</head>
<p>Another question follows: Whether there be one God or more? And this indeed contains
much ambiguity. For not only do individuals differ among themselves, but also peoples and
nations. But he who shall follow the guidance of reason will understand that there cannot
be a Lord except one, nor a Father except one. For if God, who made all things, is also Lord
and Father, He must be one only, so that the same may be the head and source of all things.
Nor is it possible for the world1445 to exist unless all things be referred to one person, unless
one hold the rudder, unless one guide the reins, and, as it were, one mind direct all the
members of the body. If there are many kings in a swarm of bees, they will perish or be
scattered abroad, while
<lg>
<l>“Discord attacks the kings with great commotion.”1446</l>
</lg>
If there are several leaders in a herd, they will contend until one gains the mastery.1447 If
there are many commanders in an army, the soldiers cannot obey, since different commands
are given; nor can unity be maintained by themselves, since each consults his own interests
according to his humours.1448 Thus, in this commonwealth of the world, unless there were
one ruler, who was also its founder, either this mass would be dissolved, or it could not have
been put together at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, the whole authority could not exist in many deities, since they separately
maintain their own duties and their own prerogatives. No one, therefore, of them can be
called omnipotent, which is the true title of God, since he will be able to accomplish that
only which depends upon himself, and will not venture to attempt that which depends upon
others. Vulcan will not claim for himself water, nor Neptune fire; nor will Ceres claim acquaintance
with the arts, nor Minerva with fruits; nor will Mercury lay claim to arms, nor
Mars to the lyre; Jupiter will not claim medicine, nor Æsculapius the thunderbolt: he will
more easily endure it when thrown by another, than he will brandish it himself. If, therefore,
individuals cannot do all things, they have less strength and less power; but he is to be regarded
as God who can accomplish the whole, and not he who can only accomplish the
smallest part of the whole.</p>

<head>CHAP. III.—THE TESTIMONIES OF THE POETS CONCERNING THE ONE GOD.</head>
<p>There is, then, one God, perfect, eternal, incorruptible, incapable of suffering, subject
to no circumstance or power, Himself possessing all things, ruling all things, whom the
human mind can neither estimate in thought nor mortal tongue describe in speech. For He
is too elevated and great to be conceived by the thought, or expressed by the language of
man. In short, not to speak of the prophets, the preachers of the one God, poets also, and
philosophers, and inspired women,1449 utter their testimony to the unity of God. Orpheus
speaks of the surpassing God who made the heaven and the sun, with the other heavenly
bodies; who made the earth and the seas. Also our own Maro calls the Supreme God at one
time a spirit, at another time a mind, and says that it, as though infused into limbs, puts in
motion the body of the whole world; also, that God permeates the heights of heaven, the
tracts of the sea and lands, and that all living creatures derive their life from Him. Even Ovid
was not ignorant that the world was prepared by God, whom he sometimes calls the framer
of all things, sometimes the fabricator of the world.1450</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="503"/>
<head>CHAP. IV.—THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PHILOSOPHERS TO THE UNITY OF GOD.</head>
<p>But let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is regarded as more certain than
that of the poets. Plato asserts His monarchy, saying that there is but one God, by whom
the world was prepared and completed with wonderful order. Aristotle, his disciple, admits
that there is one mind which presides over the world. Antisthenes says that there is one who
is God by nature,1451 the governor of the whole system. It would be a long task to recount
the statements which have been made respecting the Supreme God, either by Thales, or by
Pythagoras and Anaximenes before him, or afterwards by the Stoics Cleanthes and
Chrysippus and Zeno, or of our countrymen, by Seneca following the Stoics, and by Tullius
himself, since all these attempted to define the being of God,1452 and affirmed that the world
is ruled by Him alone, and that He is not subject to any nature, since all nature derives its
origin from Him.</p>
<p>Hermes, who, on account of his virtue and his knowledge of many arts, deserved the
name of Trismegistus, who preceded the philosophers in the antiquity of his doctrine, and
who is reverenced by the Egyptians as a god, in asserting the majesty of the one God with
infinite praises, calls Him Lord and Father, and says that He is without a name because He
does not stand in need of a proper name, inasmuch as He is alone, and that He has no parents,
since He exists of Himself and by Himself. In writing to his son he thus begins: To understand
God is difficult, to describe Him in speech is impossible, even for one to whom it is possible
to understand Him; for the perfect cannot be comprehended by the imperfect, nor the invisible
by the visible.</p>

<pb n="504"/>
<head>CHAP. V.—THAT THE PROPHETIC WOMEN—THAT IS, THE SIBYLS—DECLARE
THAT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD.</head>
<p>It remains to speak of the prophetic women. Varro relates that there were ten Sibyls,—the
first of the Persians, the second the Libyan, the third the Delphian, the fourth the Cimmerian,
the fifth the Erythræan, the sixth the Samian, the seventh the Cumæan, the eighth the
Hellespontian, the ninth the Phrygian, the tenth the Tiburtine, who has the name of Albunea.
Of all these, he says that there are three books of the Cumæan alone which contain the fates
of the Romans, and are accounted sacred, but that there exist, and are commonly regarded
as separate, books of almost all the others, but that they are entitled, as though by one name,
Sibylline books, excepting that the Erythræan, who is said to have lived in the times of the
Trojan war, placed her name in her book: the writings of the others are mixed together.1453</p>
<p>All these Sibyls of whom I have spoken, except the Cumæan, whom none but the
Quindecemviri1454 are allowed to read, bear witness that there is but one God, the ruler,
the maker, the parent, not begotten of any, but sprung from Himself, who was from all ages,
and will be to all ages; and therefore is alone worthy of being worshipped, alone of being
feared, alone of being reverenced, by all living beings;—whose testimonies I have omitted
because I was unable to abridge them; but if you wish to see them, you must have recourse
to the books themselves. Now let us follow up the remaining subjects.</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.—SINCE GOD IS ETERNAL AND IMMORTAL, HE DOES NOT STAND
IN NEED OF SEX AND SUCCESSION.</head>
<p>These testimonies, therefore, so many and so great, clearly teach that there is but one
government in the world, and one power, the origin of which cannot be imagined, or its
force described. They are foolish, therefore, who imagine that the gods were born of marriage,
since the sexes themselves, and the intercourse between them, were given to mortals by God
for this reason, that every race might be preserved by a succession of offspring. But what
need have the immortals either of sex or succession since neither pleasure nor death affects
them? Those, therefore, who are reckoned as gods, since it is evident that they were born
as men, and that they begat others, were plainly mortals: but they were believed to be gods,
because, when they were great and powerful kings, on account of the benefits which they
had conferred upon men, they deserved to obtain divine honours after death; and temples
and statues being erected to them, their memory was retained and celebrated as that of immortals.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="506"/>
<head>CHAP. VII.—OF THE WICKED LIFE AND DEATH OF HERCULES.</head>
<p>But though almost all nations are persuaded that they are gods, yet their actions, as related
both by poets and historians, declare that they were men. Who is ignorant of the times in
which Hercules lived, since he both sailed with the Argonauts on their expedition, and
having stormed Troy, slew Laomedon, the father of Priam, on account of his perjury? From
that time rather more than fifteen hundred years are reckoned. He is said not even to have
been born honourably, but to have been sprung from Alcmena by adultery, and to have
been himself addicted to the vices of his father. He never abstained from women, or males,
and traversed the whole world, not so much for the sake of glory as of lust, nor so much for
the slaughter of beasts as for the begetting of children. And though he was unvanquished,
yet he was triumphed over by Omphale alone, to whom he gave up his club and lion’s skin;
and being clothed in a woman’s garment, and crouching at a woman’s feet, he received his
task1455 to execute. He afterwards, in a transport of frenzy, killed his little children and his
wife Megara. At last, having put on a garment sent by his wife Deianyra, when he was perishing
through ulcers, being unable to endure the pain, he constructed for himself a funeral
pile on Mount OEta, and burnt himself alive. Thus it is effected, that although on account
of his excellence1456 he might have been believed to be a god, nevertheless on account of
these things be is believed to have been a man.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF ÆSCULAPIUS, APOLLO, MARS, CASTOR AND POLLUX, AND
OF MERCURIUS AND BACCHUS.</head>
<p>Tarquitius relates that Æsculapius was born of doubtful parents, and that on this account
he was exposed; and being taken up by hunters, and fed by the teats of a hound, was given
to Chiron for instruction. He lived at Epidaurus, and was buried at Cynosuræ, as Cicero
says,1457 when he had been killed by lightning. But Apollo, his father, did not disdain to
take charge of another’s flock that he might receive a wife;1458 and when he had unintentionally
killed a boy whom he loved, he inscribed his own lamentations on a flower. Mars,
a man of the greatest bravery, was not free from the charge of adultery, since he was made
a spectacle, being bound with a chain together with the adulteress.</p>
<p>Castor and Pollux carried off the brides of others, but not with impunity, to whose death
and burial Homer bears witness, not with poetical, but simple faith. Mercurius, who was
the father of Androgynus by his intrigue with Venus, deserved to be a god, because he invented
the lyre and the palæstra. Father Bacchus, after subduing India as a conqueror, having
by chance come to Crete, saw Ariadne on the shore, whom Theseus had forced and deserted.
Then, being inflamed by love, he united her in marriage to himself, and placed her crown,
as the poets say, conspicuously among the stars. The mother of the gods1459 herself, while
she lived in Phrygia after the banishment and death of her husband, though a widow, and
aged, was enamoured of a beautiful youth; and because he was not faithful, she mutilated,
and rendered him effeminate: on which account even now she delights in the Galli1460 as
her priests.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE DISGRACEFUL DEEDS OF THE GODS.</head>
<p>Whence did Ceres bring forth Proserpine, except from debauchery? Whence did Latona
bring forth her twins, except from crime? Venus having been subject to the lusts of gods
and men, when she reigned in Cyprus, invented the practice of courtesanship, and commanded
women to make traffic of themselves, that she might not alone be infamous. Were
the virgins themselves, Minerva and Diana, chaste? Whence, then, did Erichthonius arise?
Did Vulcan shed his seed upon the ground, and was man born from that as a fungus? Or
why did Diana banish Hippolytus either to a retired place, or give him up to a woman, where
he might pass his life in solitude among unknown groves, and having now changed his
name, might be called Virbius? What do these things signify but impurity, which the poets
do not venture to confess?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<pb n="509"/>
<head>CHAP. X.—OF JUPITER, AND HIS LICENTIOUS LIFE.</head>
<p>But respecting the king and father of all these, Jupiter, whom they believe to possess the
chief power in heaven,—what power1461 had he, who banished his father Saturnus from his
kingdom, and pursued him with arms when he fled? What self-restraint had he, who indulged
every kind of lust? For he made Alcmena and Leda, the wives of great men, infamous through
his adultery: he also, captivated with the beauty of a boy, carried him off with violence as
he was hunting and meditating manly things, that he might treat him as a woman. Why
should I mention his debaucheries of virgins? and how great a multitude of these there was,
is shown by the number of his sons. In the case of Thetis alone he was more temperate. For
it bad been predicted that the son whom she should bring forth would be more powerful
than his father. Therefore he struggled with his love, that one might not be born greater
than himself. He knew, therefore, that he was not of perfect virtue, greatness, and power,
since he feared that which he himself had done to his father. Why, therefore, is he called
best and greatest, since he both contaminated himself with faults, which is the part of one
who is unjust and bad, and feared a greater than himself, which is the part of one who is
weak and inferior?</p>

<pb n="510"/>
<head>CHAP. XI.—THE VARIOUS EMBLEMS UNDER WHICH THE POETS VEILED THE
TURPITUDE OF JUPITER.</head>
<p>But some one will say that these things are feigned by the poets. This is not the usage
of the poets, to feign in such a manner that you fabricate the whole, but so that you cover
the actions themselves with a figure, and, as it were, with a variegated veil. Poetic licence
has this limit, not that it may invent the whole, which is the part of one who is false and
senseless, but that it may change something consistently with reason. They said that Jupiter
changed himself into a shower of gold, that he might deceive Danae. What is a shower of
gold? Plainly golden coins, by offering a great quantity of which, and pouring them into her
bosom, he corrupted the frailty of her virgin soul by this bribe. Thus also they speak of a
shower of iron, when they wish to signify a multitude of javelins. He carried off his catamite
upon an eagle. What is the eagle? Truly a legion, since the figure of this animal is the
standard of the legion. He carried Europa across the sea on a bull. What is the bull? Clearly
a ship, which had its tutelary image1462 fashioned in the shape of a bull. So assuredly the
daughter of Inachus was not turned into a cow, nor as such did she swim across, but she
escaped the anger of Juno in a ship which had the form of a cow. Lastly, when she had been
conveyed to Egypt, she became Isis, whose voyage is celebrated on a fixed day, in memory
of her flight.</p>
<note type="footnote">1462 Tutela. The image of some deity, supposed to be the tutelary guardian of the ship, was usually painted
on the stern.</note>

<pb n="511"/>
<head>CHAP. XII.—THE POETS DO NOT INVENT ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH RELATE
TO THE GODS.</head>
<p>You see, then, that the poets did not invent all things, and that they prefigured some
things, that, when they spoke the truth, they might add something like this of divinity to
those whom they called gods; as they did also respecting their kingdoms. For when they say
that Jupiter had by lot the kingdom of Coelus, they either menu Mount Olympus, on which
ancient stories relate that Saturnus, and afterwards Jupiter, dwelt, or a part of the East, which
is, as it were, higher, because the light arises thence; but the region of the West is lower, and
therefore they say that Pluto obtained the lower regions; but that the sea was given to
Neptune, because he had the maritime coast, with all the islands. Many things are thus coloured
by the poets; and they who are ignorant of this, censure them as false, but only in
word: for in fact they believe them, since they so fashion the images of the gods, that when
they make them male and female, and confess that some are married, some parents, and
some children, they plainly assent to the poets; for these relations cannot exist without intercourse
and the generation of children.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="512"/>
<head>CHAP. XIII.—THE ACTIONS OF JUPITER ARE RELATED FROM THE HISTORIAN
EUHEMERUS.</head>
<p>But let us leave the poets; let us come to history, which is supported both by the credibility
of the facts and by the antiquity of the times. Euhemerus was a Messenian, a very ancient
writer, who gave an account of the origin of Jupiter, and his exploits, and all his posterity,
gathered from the sacred inscriptions of ancient temples; he also traced out the parents of
the other gods, their countries, actions, commands, and deaths, and even their sepulchres.
And this history Ennius translated into Latin, whose words are these:—
<lg>
<l>“As these things are written, so is the origin and kindred of Jupiter and his
brothers; after this manner it is handed clown to us in the sacred
writing.”</l>
</lg>
The same Euhemerus therefore relates that Jupiter, when he had five times gone round the
world, and had distributed governments to his friends and relatives, and had given laws to
men, and had wrought many other benefits, being endued with immortal glory and everlasting
remembrance, ended his life in Crete, and departed to the gods, and that his sepulchre
is in Crete, in the town of Gnossus, and that upon it is engraved in ancient Greek letters
Zankronou, which is Jupiter the son of Saturnus. It is plain, therefore, from the things which
I have related, that he was a man, and reigned on the earth.</p>

HISTORIANS.</head>
<p>Let us pass on to former things, that we may discover the origin of the whole error.
Saturnus is said to have been born of Coelus and Terra. This is plainly incredible; but there
is a certain reason why it is thus related, and he who is ignorant of this rejects it as a fable.
That Uranus was the father of Saturnus, both Hermes affirms, and sacred history teaches.
When Trismegistus said that there were very few men of perfect learning, he enumerated
among them his relatives, Uranus, Saturnus, and Mercurius. Euhemerus relates that the
same Uranus was the first who reigned on earth, using these words: “In the beginning Coelus
first had the chief power on earth: he instituted and prepared that kingdom for himself together
with his brothers.”1463</p>

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF THE GODS PECULIAR TO THE ROMANS.</head>
<p>I have spoken of the religious rites which are common to all nations. I will now speak
of the gods which the Romans have peculiar to themselves. Who does not know that the
wife of Faustulus, the nurse of Romulus and Remus, in honour of whom the Larentinalia
were instituted, was a harlot? And for this reason she was called Lupa, and represented in
the form of a wild beast. Faula also and Flora were harlots, of whom the one was the mistress
of Hercules, as Verrius relates; the other, having acquired great wealth by her person, made
the people her heir, and on this account the games called Floralia are celebrated in her
honour.</p>
<p>Tatius consecrated the statue of a woman which had been found in the principal sewer,
and called it by the name of the goddess Cloacina. The Romans, being besieged by the Gauls,
made engines for throwing weapons of the hair of women; and on this account they erected
an altar and temple to Venus Calva:1464 also to Jupiter Pistor,1465 because he had advised
them in a dream to make all their corn into bread, and to throw it upon the enemy; and
when this had been done, the Gauls, despairing of being able to reduce the Romans by
famine, had abandoned the siege. Tullus Hostilius made Fear and Pallor gods. Mind is also
worshipped; but if they had possessed it, they would never, I believe, have thought that it
ought to be worshipped. Marcellus originated Honour and Virtue.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF THE SACRED RITES OF THE ROMAN GODS.</head>
<p>But the senate also instituted other false gods of this kind,—Hope, Faith, Concord,
Peace, Chastity, Piety; all of which, since they ought truly to be in the minds of men, they
have falsely placed within walls. But although these have no substantial existence outside
of man, nevertheless I should prefer that they should be worshipped, rather than Blight or
Fever, which ought not to be consecrated, but rather to be execrated; than Fornax, together
with her sacred ovens; than Stercutus, who first showed men to enrich the ground with
manure; than the goddess Muta, who brought forth the Lares; than Cumina, who presides
over the cradles of infants; than Caca, who gave information to Hercules respecting the
stealing of his cattle, that he might slay her brother. How many other monstrous and
ludicrous fictions there are, respecting which it is grievous to speak! I do not, however, wish
to omit notice of Terminus, since it is related that he did not give way even to Jupiter, though
he was an unwrought stone. They suppose that he has the custody of the boundaries, and
public prayers are offered to him, that he may keep the stone of the Capitol immoveable,
and preserve and extend the boundaries of the Roman empire.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF THE SACRED RITES INTRODUCED BY FAUNUS AND NUMA.</head>
<p>Faunas was the first in Latium who introduced these follies, who both instituted bloody
sacrifices to his grandfather Saturnus, and wished that his father Picus should be worshipped
as a god, and placed Fatua Fauna his wife and sister among the gods, and named her the
good goddess. Then at Rome, Numa, who burthened those rude and rustic then with new
superstitions, instituted priesthoods, and distributed the gods into families and nations,
that he might call off the fierce spirits of the people from the pursuits of arms. Therefore
Lucilius, in deriding the folly of those who are slaves to vain superstitions, introduced these
verses:—
<lg>
<l>“Those bugbears1466 the Lamiæ, which Faunus and Numa Pompilius and others
instituted, at these he trembles; he places everything in this. As infant
boys believe that every statue of bronze is a living man, so these imagine
that all things reigned are true: they believe that statues of bronze
contain a heart. It is a painter’s1467 gallery; nothing is real, everything
fictitious.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Tullius also, writing of the nature of the gods, complains that false and fictitious gods
have been introduced, and that from thus source have arisen false opinions, and turbulent
errors, and almost old womanly superstitions, which opinion ought in comparison1468 with
others to be esteemed more weighty, because these things were spoken by one who was both
a philosopher and a priest.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE GODS AND SACRED RITES OF THE BARBARIANS.</head>
<p>We have spoken respecting the gods: now we will speak of the rites and practices of
their sacred institutions. A human victim used to be immolated to the Cyprian Jupiter, as
Teucer had appointed. Thus also the Tauri used to offer strangers to Diana; the Latian Jupiter
also was propitiated with human blood. Also before Saturnus, men of sixty years of age,
according to the oracle1469 of Apollo, were thrown from a bridge into the Tiber. And the
Carthaginians not only offered infants to the same Saturnus; but being conquered by the
Sicilians, to make an expiation, they immolated two hundred sons of nobles. And not more
mild than these are those offerings which are even now made to the Great Mother and to
Bellona, in which the priests make an offering, not with the blood of others, but with their
own blood; when, mutilating themselves, they cease to be men, and yet do not pass over to
the women; or, cutting their shoulders, they sprinkle the loathsome altars with their own
blood. But these things are cruel.</p>
<p>Let us come to those which are mild. The sacred rites of Isis show nothing else than the
manner in which she lost and found her little son, who is called Osiris. For first her priests
and attendants, having shaved all their limbs, and beating their breasts, howl, lament, and
search, imitating the manner in which his mother was affected; afterwards the boy is found
by Cynocephalus. Thus the mournful rites are ended with gladness. The mystery of Ceres
also resembles these, in which torches are lighted, and Proserpine is sought for through the
night; and when she has been found, the whole rite is finished with congratulations and the
throwing about of torches. The people of Lampsacus, offer an ass to Priapus as an appropriate
victim.1470 Lindus is a town of Rhodes, where sacred rites in honour of Hercules are celebrated
with revilings. For when Hercules had taken away his oxen from a ploughman, and
had slain them, he avenged his injury by taunts; and afterwards having been himself appointed
priest, it was ordained that he himself, and other priests after him, should celebrate
sacrifices with the same revilings. But the mystery of the Cretan Jupiter represents the
manner in which he was withdrawn from his father, or brought up. The goat is beside him,
by the teats of which Amalthea nourished the boy. The sacred rites of the mother of the
gods also show the same thing. For because the Corybantes then drowned the cry of the boy
by the tinkling of their helmets and the striking of their shields, a representation of this
circumstance is now repeated in the sacred rites; but cymbals are beaten instead of helmets,
and drums instead of shields, that Saturnus may not hear the cries of the boy.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
<pb n="518"/>
<head>CHAP. XXIV.—OF THE ORIGIN OF SACRED RITES AND SUPERSTITIONS.</head>
<p>These are the mysteries of the gods. Now let us inquire also into the origin of superstitions,
that we may search out by whom and at what times they were instituted. Didymus,
in those books which are inscribed Of the Explanation of Pindar, relates that Melisseus was
king of the Cretans, whose daughters were Amalthea and Melissa, who nourished Jupiter
with goats’ milk and honey; that he introduced new rites and ceremonies of sacred things,
and was the first who sacrificed to gods, that is, to Vesta, who is called Tellus,—whence the
poet says:—
<lg>
<l>“And the first of the gods,</l>
<l>Tellus,”—</l>
</lg>
and afterwards to the mother of the gods. But Euhemerus, in his sacred history, says that
Jupiter himself, after that he received the government, erected temples in honour of himself
in many places. For in going about the world, as he came to each place he united the chiefs
of the people to himself in friendship and the right of hospitality; and that the remembrance
of this might be preserved, he ordered that temples should be built to him, and annual
festivals be celebrated by those connected with him in a league of hospitality. Thus he spread
the worship of himself through all lands. But at what time they lived can easily be inferred.
For Thallus writes in his history, that Belus, the king of the Assyrians, whom the Babylonians
worship, and who was the contemporary and friend of Saturnus, was three hundred and
twenty-two years before the Trojan war, and it is fourteen hundred and seventy years since
the taking of Troy. From which it is evident, that it is not more than eighteen hundred years
from the time when mankind fell into error by the institution of new forms of divine worship.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="519"/>
<head>CHAP. XXV.—OF THE GOLDEN AGE, OF IMAGES, AND PROMETHEUS, WHO
FIRST FASHIONED MAN.</head>
<p>The poets, therefore, with good reason say that the golden age, which existed in the
reign of Saturnus, was changed. For at that time no gods were worshipped, but they knew
of one God only. After that they subjected themselves to frail and earthly things, worshipping
idols of wood, and brass, and stone, a change took place from the golden age to that of iron.
For having lost the knowledge of God, and broken off that one bond of human society, they
began to harass one another, to plunder and subdue. But if they would raise their eyes aloft
and behold God, who raised them up to the sight of heaven and Himself, they never would
bend and prostrate themselves by worshipping earthly things, whose folly Lucretius severely
rebukes, saying:1471
<lg>
<l>“And they abase their souls with fear of the gods, and weigh and press them
down to the earth.”1472</l>
</lg>
Wherefore they tremble, and do not understand how foolish it is to fear those things which
you have made, or to hope for any protection from those things which are dumb and insensible,
and neither see nor hear the suppliant. What majesty, therefore, or deity can they have,
which were in the power of a man, that they should not be made, or that they should be
made into some other thing, and are so even now? For they are liable to injury and might
be carried off by theft, were it not that they are protected by the law and the guardianship
of man. Does he therefore appear to be in possession of his senses, who sacrifices to such
deities the choicest victims, consecrates gifts, offers costly garments, as if they who are
without motion could use them? With reason, then, did Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily
plunder and deride the gods of Greece when he had taken possession of it as conqueror;
and after the sacrilegious acts which he had committed, he returned to Sicily with a prosperous
voyage, and held the kingdom even to his old age: nor were the injured gods able to
punish him.</p>
<p>How much better is it to despise vanities, and to turn to God, to maintain the condition
which you have received from God, to maintain your name! For on this account he is called
anthropos,1473 because he looks upward. But he looks upward who looks up to the true and
living God, who is in heaven; who seeks after the Maker and Parent of his soul, not only
with his perception and mind, but also with his countenance and eyes raised aloft. But he
who enslaves himself to earthly and humble things, plainly prefers to himself that which is

below him. For since he himself is the workmanship of God, whereas an image is the
workmanship of man, the human workmanship cannot be preferred to the divine; and as
God is the parent of man, so is the man of the statue. Therefore he is foolish and senseless
who adores that which he himself has made, of which detestable and foolish handicraft
Prometheus was the author, who was born from Iapetus the uncle of Jupiter. For when first
of all Jupiter, having obtained supreme dominion, wished to establish himself as a god, and
to found temples, and was seeking for some one who was able to imitate the human figure,
at that time Prometheus lived, who fashioned the image of a man from thick clay with such
close resemblance, that the novelty and cleverness of the art was a wonder. At length the
men of his own time, and afterwards the poets, handed him down as the maker of a true
and living man; and we, as often as we praise wrought statues, say that they live and breathe.
And he indeed was the inventor of earthenware images. But posterity, following him, both
carved them out of marble, and moulded them out of bronze; then in process of time ornament
was added of gold and ivory, so that not only the likenesses, but also the gleam itself,
might dazzle the eyes. Thus ensnared by beauty, and forgetful of true majesty, sensible beings
considered that insensible objects, rational beings that irrational objects, living beings that
lifeless objects, were to be worshipped and reverenced by them.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVI.—OF THE WORSHIP OF THE ELEMENTS AND STARS.</head>
<p>Now let us refute those also who regard the elements of the world as gods, that is, the
heaven, the sun, and the moon; for being ignorant of the Maker of these things, they admire
and adore the works themselves. And this error belongs not to the ignorant only, but also
to philosophers; since the Stoics are of opinion that all the heavenly bodies are to be considered
as among the number of the gods, since they all have fixed and regular motions, by
which they most constantly preserve the vicissitudes of the times which succeed them. They
do not then possess voluntary motion, since they obey prescribed laws, and plainly not by
their own sense, but by the workmanship of the supreme Creator, who so ordered them
that they should complete unerring1474 courses and fixed circuits, by which they might vary
the alternations of days and nights, of summer and winter. But if men admire the effects of
these, if they admire their courses, their brightness, their regularity, their beauty, they ought
to have understood how much more beautiful, more illustrious, and more powerful than
these is the maker and contriver Himself, even God. But they estimated the Divinity by objects
which fall under the sight of men;1475 not knowing that objects which come within the sight
cannot be eternal, and that those which are eternal cannot be discerned by mortal eyes.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXVII.—OF THE CREATION, SIN, AND PUNISHMENT OF MAN; AND OF
ANGELS, BOTH GOOD AND BAD.</head>
<p>One subject remains, and that the last: that, since it usually happens, as we read in histories,
that the gods appear to have displayed their majesty by auguries, by dreams, by oracles,
and also by the punishments of those who had committed sacrilege, I may show what cause
produced this effect, so that no one even now may fall into the same snares into which those
of old fell. When God, according to His excellent majesty, had framed the world out of
nothing, and had decked the heaven with lights, and had filled the earth and the sea with
living creatures, then He formed man out of clay, and fashioned him after the resemblance
of His own likeness, and breathed into him that he might live,1476 and placed him in a
garden1477 which He had planted with every kind of fruit-bearing tree, and commanded
him not to eat of one tree in which He had placed the knowledge of good and evil, warning
him that it would come to pass, that if he did so he would lose his life, but that if he observed
the command of God he would remain immortal. Then the serpent, who was one of the
servants of God, envying man because he was made immortal, enticed him by stratagem to
transgress the command and law of God. And in this manner he did indeed receive the
knowledge of good and evil, but he lost the life which God had given him to be for ever.</p>
<p>Therefore He drove out the sinner from the sacred place, and banished him into this
world, that he might seek sustenance by labour, that he might according to his deserts undergo
difficulties and troubles; and He surrounded the garden itself with a fence of fire, that
none of men even till the day of judgment might attempt secretly1478 to enter into that place
of perpetual blessedness. Then death came upon man according to the sentence of God;
and yet his life, though it had begun to be temporary, had as its boundary a thousand years,
and that was the extent of human life even to the deluge. For after the flood the life of men
was gradually shortened, and was reduced to a hundred and twenty years. But that serpent,
who from his deeds received the name of devil, that is, accuser or informer, did not cease
to persecute the seed of man, whom he had deceived from the beginning. At length he urged
him who was first born in this world, under the impulse of envy, to the murder of his
brother, that of the two men who were first born he might destroy the one, and make the
other a parricide.1479 Nor did he cease upon this from infusing the venom of malice into
the breasts of men through each generation, from corrupting and depraving them; in short,
from overwhelming them with such crimes, that an instance of justice was now rare, but
men lived after the manner of the beasts.</p>

<p>But when God saw this, He sent His angels to instruct the race of men, and to protect
them from all evil. He gave these a command to abstain from earthly things, lest, being
polluted by any taint, they should be deprived of the honour of angels. But that wily accuser,
while they tarried among men, allured these also to pleasures, so that they might defile
themselves with women. Then, being condemned by the sentence of God, and cast forth on
account of their sins, they lost both the name and substance of angels. Thus, having become
ministers of the devil, that they might have a solace of their ruin, they betook themselves to
the ruining of men, for whose protection they had come.1480</p>

<pb n="524"/>
<head>CHAP. XXVIII.—OF THE DEMONS, AND THEIR EVIL PRACTICES.</head>
<p>These are the demons, of whom the poets often speak in their poems, whom Hesiod
calls the guardians of men. For they so persuaded men by their enticements and deceits,
that they believed that the same were gods. In fine, Socrates used to give out that he had a
demon as the guardian and director of his life from his first childhood, and that he could
do nothing without his assent and command. They attach themselves, therefore, to individuals,
and occupy houses under the name of Genii or Penates. To these temples are built, to
these libations are daily offered as to the Lares, to these honour is paid as to the averters of
evils. These from the beginning, that they might turn away men from the knowledge of the
true God, introduced new superstitions and worship of gods. These taught that the memory
of dead kings should be consecrated, temples be built, and images made, not that they might
lessen the honour of God, or increase their own, which they lost by sinning, but that they
might take away life from men, deprive them of the hope of true light, lest men should arrive
at that heavenly reward of immortality from which they fell. They also brought to light astrology,
and augury, and divination; and though these things are in themselves false, yet
they themselves, the authors of evils, so govern and regulate them that they are believed to
be true. They also invented the tricks of the magic art, to deceive the eyes. By their aid it
comes to pass, that that which is appears not to be, and that which is not appears to be. They
themselves invented necromancies, responses, and oracles, to delude the minds of men with
lying divination by means of ambiguous issues. They are present in the temples and at all
sacrifices; and by the exhibition of some deceitful prodigies, to the surprise of those who
are present, they so deceive men, that they believe that a divine power is present in images
and statues. They even enter secretly into bodies, as being slight spirits; and they excite diseases
in the vitiated limbs, which when appeased with sacrifices and vows they may again
remove. They send dreams either full of terror,1481 that they themselves may be invoked,
or the issues of which may correspond with the truth, that they may increase the veneration
paid to themselves. Sometimes also they put forth something of vengeance against the sacrilegious,
that whoever sees it may become more timid and superstitious. Thus by their
frauds they have drawn darkness over the human race, that truth might be oppressed, and
the name of the supreme and matchless God might be forgotten.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIX.—OF THE PATIENCE AND PROVIDENCE OF GOD.</head>
<p>But some one says: Why, then, does the true God permit these things to be done? Why
does He not rather remove or destroy the wicked? Why, in truth, did He from the beginning
give power1482 to the demon, so that there should be one who might corrupt and destroy
all things? I will briefly say why He willed that this should be so. I ask whether virtue is a
good or an evil. It cannot be denied that it is a good. If virtue is a good, vice, on the contrary,
is an evil. If vice is an evil on this account, because it opposes virtue, and virtue is on this
account a good, because it overthrows vice, it follows that virtue cannot exist without vice;
and if you take away vice, the merits of virtue will be taken away. For there can be no victory
without an enemy. Thus it comes to pass, that good cannot exist without an evil.</p>
<p>Chrysippus, a man of active mind, saw this when discussing the subject of providence,
and charges those with folly who think that good is caused by God, but say that evil is not
thus caused. Aulus Gellius1483 has interpreted his sentiment in his books of Attic Nights;
thus saying: “They to whom it does not appear that the world was made for the sake of God
and men, and that human affairs are governed by providence, think that they use a weighty
argument when they thus speak: If there were a providence, there would be no evils. For
they say that nothing is less in agreement with providence, than that in this world, on account
of which it is said that God made men,1484 the power of troubles and evils should be so
great. In reply to these things, Chrysippus, when he was arguing, in his fourth book respecting
providence, said: Nothing can be more foolish than those who think that good things could
have existed, if there were not evils in the same place. For since good things are contrary to
evil, they must of necessity be opposed to each other, and must stand resting, as it were, on
mutual and opposite support.1485 Thus there is no contrary without another contrary. For
how could there be any perception of justice, unless there were injuries? or what else is
justice, but the removal of injustice? In like manner, the nature of fortitude cannot be understood,
except by placing1486 beside it cowardice, or the nature of self-control except by
intemperance. Likewise, in what manner would there be prudence, unless there were the
contrary, imprudence? On the same principle, he says, why do the foolish men not require
this also, that there should be truth and not falsehood? For there exist together good and
evil things, prosperity and trouble, pleasure and pain. For the one being bound to the other
at opposite poles, as Plato says, if you take away one, you take away both.” You see, therefore,
that which I have often said, that good and evil are so connected with one another, that the

one cannot exist without the other. Therefore God acted with the greatest foresight in placing
the subject-matter of virtue in evils which He made for this purpose, that He might establish
for us a contest, in which He would crown the victorious with the reward of immortality.1487</p>

<head>CHAP. XXX.—OF FALSE WISDOM.</head>
<p>I have taught, as I imagine, that the honours paid to gods are not only impious, but also
vain, either because they were men whose memory was consecrated after death; or because
the images themselves are insensible and deaf, inasmuch as they are formed of earth, and
that it is not right for man, who ought to look up to heavenly things, to subject himself to
earthly things; or because the spirits who claim to themselves those acts of religious service
are unholy and impure, and on this account, being condemned by the sentence of God, fell
to the earth, and that it is not lawful to submit to the power of those to whom you are superior,
if you wish to be a follower of the true God. It remains that, as we have spoken of false
religion, we should also discuss the subject of false wisdom, which the philosophers profess,—
men endued with the greatest learning and eloquence, but far removed from the truth,
because they neither know God nor the wisdom of God. And although they are clever and
learned, yet, because their wisdom is human, I shall not fear to contend with them, that it
may be evident that falsehood can be easily overcome by truth, and earthly things by heavenly.</p>
<p>They thus define the nature of philosophy. Philosophy is the love or pursuit of wisdom.
Therefore it is not wisdom itself; for that which loves must be different from that which is
loved. If it is the pursuit of wisdom, not even thus is philosophy identical with wisdom. For
wisdom is the object itself which is sought, but the pursuit is that which seeks it. Therefore
the very definition or meaning of the word plainly shows that philosophy is not wisdom itself.
I will say that it1488 is not even the pursuit of wisdom, in which wisdom is not comprised.
For who can be said to devote himself to the pursuit of that to which he can by no means
attain? He who gives himself to the pursuit of medicine, or grammar, or oratory, may be
said to be studious of that art which he is learning; but when he has learned, he is now said
to be a physician, a grammarian, or an orator. Thus also those who are studious of wisdom,
after they had learned it, ought to have been called wise. But since they are called students
of wisdom as long as they live, it is manifest that that is not the pursuit, because it is impossible
to arrive at the object itself which is sought for in the pursuit, unless by chance they
who pursue wisdom even to the end of life are about to be wise in another world. Now every
pursuit is connected with some end. That, therefore, is not a right pursuit which has no end.

<head>CHAP. XXXI.—OF KNOWLEDGE AND SUPPOSITION.</head>
<p>Moreover, there are two things which appear to fall under the subject of philosophy—
knowledge and supposition; and if these are taken away, philosophy altogether falls
to the ground. But the chief of the philosophers themselves have taken away both from
philosophy. Socrates took away knowledge, Zeno supposition. Let us see whether they were
right in doing so. Wisdom is, as Cicero defined it,1489 the knowledge of divine and human
things. Now if this definition is true, wisdom does not come within the power of man. For
who of mortals can assume this to himself, to profess that he knows divine and human
things? I say nothing of human affairs; for although they are connected with divine, yet,
since they belong to man, let us grant that it is possible for man to know them. Certainly he
cannot know divine things by himself, since he is a man; whereas he who knows them must
be divine, and therefore God. But man is neither divine nor God. Man, therefore, cannot
thoroughly know divine things by himself. No one, therefore, is wise but God, or certainly
that man whom God has taught. But they, because they are neither gods, nor taught by God,
cannot be wise, that is, acquainted with divine and human things. Knowledge, therefore, is
rightly taken away by Socrates and the Academics. Supposition also does not agree with the
wise man. For every one supposes that of which he is ignorant. Now, to suppose that you
know that of which you are ignorant, is rashness and folly. Supposition, therefore, was rightly
taken away by Zeno. If, therefore, there is no knowledge in man, and there ought to be no
supposition, philosophy is cut up by the roots.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXII.—OF THE SECTS OF PHILOSOPHERS, AND THEIR DISAGREEMENT.</head>
<p>To this is added, that it1490 is not uniform; but being divided into sects, and scattered
into many and discordant opinions, it has no fixed state. For since they all separately attack
and harass one another, and there is none of them which is not condemned of folly in the
judgment of the rest, while the members are plainly at variance with one another, the whole
body of philosophy is brought to destruction. Hence the Academy afterwards originated.
For when the leading men of that sect saw that philosophy was altogether overthrown by
philosophers mutually opposing each other, they undertook war against all, that they might
destroy all the arguments of all; while they themselves assert nothing except one thing—that
nothing can be known. Thus, having taken away knowledge, they overthrew the ancient
philosophy. But they did not even themselves retain the name of philosophers, since they
admitted their ignorance, because to be ignorant of all things is not only not the part of a
philosopher, but not even of a man. Thus the philosophers, because they have no defence,
must destroy one another with mutual wounds, and philosophy itself must altogether consume
and put an end to itself by its own arms. But they say it is only natural philosophy
which thus gives way. How is it with moral? Does that rest on any firm foundation? Let us
see whether philosophers are agreed in this part at any rate, which relates to the condition
of life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXIII.—WHAT IS THE CHIEF GOOD TO BE SOUGHT IN LIFE.</head>
<p>What is the chief good must be an object of inquiry, that our whole life and actions may
be directed to it. When inquiry is made respecting the chief good of man, it ought to be
settled to be of such a kind, first, that it have reference to man alone; in the next place, that
it belong peculiarly to the mind; lastly, that it be sought by virtue. Let us see, therefore,
whether the chief good which the philosophers mark out be such that it has reference neither
to a dumb animal nor to the body, and cannot be attained without virtue.</p>
<p>Aristippus, the founder of the Cyrenaic sect, who thought that bodily pleasure was the
chief good, ought to be removed from the number of philosophers, and from the society of
men, because he compared himself to a beast. The chief good of Hieronymus is to be without
pain, that of Diodorus to cease to be in pain. But the other animals avoid pain; and when
they are without pain, or cease to be in pain, are glad. What distinction, then, will be given
to man, if his chief good is judged to be common with the beasts? Zeno thought that the
chief good was to live agreeably to nature. But this definition is a general one. For all animals
live agreeably to nature, and each has its own nature.</p>
<p>Epicurus maintained that it was pleasure of the soul. What is pleasure of the soul but
joy, in which the soul for the most part luxuriates, and unbends itself either to sport or to
laughter? But this good befalls even dumb animals, which, when they are satisfied with
pasture, relax themselves to joy and wantonness. Dinomachus and Callipho approved of
honourable pleasure; but they either said the same that Epicurus did, that bodily pleasure
is dishonourable; or if they considered bodily pleasures to be partly base and partly honourable,
then that is not the chief good which is ascribed to the body. The Peripatetics make
up the chief good of goods of the soul, and body, and fortune. The goods of the soul may
be approved of; but if they require assistance for the completion of happiness, they are
plainly weak. But the goods of the body and of fortune are not in the power of man; nor is
that now the chief good which is assigned to the body, or to things placed without us, because
this double good extends even to the cattle, which have need of being well, and of a due
supply of food. The Stoics are believed to have entertained much better views, who said that
virtue was the chief good. But virtue cannot be the chief good, since, if it is the endurance
of evils and of labours, it is not happy of itself; but it ought to effect and produce the chief
good, because it cannot be attained without the greatest difficulty and labour. But, in truth,
Aristotle wandered far from reason, who connected honour with virtue, as though it were
possible for virtue at any time to be separated from honour, or to be united with baseness.</p>
<p>Herillus the Pyrrhonist made knowledge the chief good. This indeed belongs to man,
and to the soul only, but it may happen to him without virtue. For he is not to be considered
happy who has either learnt anything by hearing, or has gained the knowledge of it by a
little reading; nor is it a definition of the chief good, because there may be a knowledge

<pb n="531"/>
either of bad things, or at any rate of things that are useless. And if it is the knowledge of
good and useful things which you have acquired by labour, nevertheless it is not the chief
good, because knowledge is not sought on its own account, but on account of something
else. For the arts are learnt on this account, that they may be to us the means of gaining
support, or a source of glory, or even of pleasure; and it is plain that these things cannot be
the chief goods. Therefore the philosophers do not observe the rule even in moral philosophy,
inasmuch as they are at variance with one another on the main point1491 itself, that is, in
that discussion by which the life is moulded. For the precepts cannot be equal, or resembling
one another, when some train men to pleasure, others to honour, others indeed to nature,
others to knowledge; some to the pursuit, others to the avoiding of riches; some to entire
insensibility to pain, others to the endurance of evils: in all which, as I have shown before,
they turn aside from reason, because they are ignorant of God.</p>

<pb n="532"/>
<head>CHAP. XXXIV.—THAT MEN ARE BORN TO JUSTICE.</head>
<p>Let us now see what is proposed to the wise man as the chief good.1492 That men are
born to justice is not only taught by the sacred writings, but is sometimes acknowledged
even by these same philosophers. Thus Cicero says: “But of all things which fall under the
discussion of learned men, nothing assuredly is more excellent than that it should be clearly
understood that we are born to justice.” This is most true.1493 For we are not born to
wickedness, since we are a social and sociable animal. The wild beasts are produced to exercise
their fierceness; for they are unable to live in any other way than by prey and bloodshed.
These, however, although pressed by extreme hunger, nevertheless refrain from animals of
their own kind. Birds also do the same, which must feed upon the carcases of others. How
much more is it befitting, that man, who is united with man both in the interchange of
language and in communion of feeling, should spare man, and love him! For this is justice.</p>
<p>But since wisdom has been given to man alone, that he may understand God, and this
alone makes the difference between man and the dumb animals, justice itself is bound up
in two duties. He owes the one to God as to a father, the other to man as to a brother; for
we are produced by the same God. Therefore it has been deservedly and rightly said, that
wisdom is the knowledge of divine and human affairs. For it is right that we should know
what we owe to God, and what to man; namely, to God religion, to man affection. But the
former belongs to wisdom, the latter to virtue; and justice comprises both. If, therefore, it
is evident that man is born to justice, it is necessary that the just man should be subject to
evils, that he may exercise the virtue with which he is endued. For virtue is the enduring of
evils. He will avoid pleasures as an evil: he will despise riches, because they are frail; and if
he has them, he will liberally bestow them, to preserve the wretched: he will not be desirous
of honours, because they are short and transitory; he will do injury to no one; if he shall
suffer, he will not retaliate; and he will not take vengeance upon one who plunders his
property. For he will deem it unlawful to injure a man; and if there shall be any one who
would compel him to depart from God, he will not refuse tortures nor death. Thus it will
come to pass, that he must necessarily live in poverty and lowliness, and in insults, or even
tortures.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
<pb n="533"/>
<head>CHAP. XXXV.—THAT IMMORTALITY IS THE CHIEF GOOD.</head>
<p>What, then, will be the advantage of justice and virtue, if they shall have nothing but
evil in life? But if virtue, which despises all earthly goods, most wisely endures all evils, and
endures death itself in the discharge of duty, cannot be without a reward, what remains but
that immortality alone is its reward? For if a happy life falls to the lot of man, as the philosophers
will have it, and in this point alone they do not disagree, therefore also immortality
falls to him. For that only is happy which is incorruptible; that only is incorruptible which
is eternal. Therefore immortality is the chief good, because it belongs both to man, and to
the soul, and to virtue. We are only directed to this; we are born to the attainment of this.
Therefore God proposes to us virtue and justice, that we may obtain that eternal reward for
our labours. But concerning that immortality1494 itself we will speak in the proper place.
There remains the philosophy of Logic,1495 which contributes nothing to a happy life. For
wisdom does not consist in the arrangement of speech, but in the heart and the feeling. But
if natural philosophy is superfluous, and this of logic, and the philosophers have erred in
moral philosophy, which alone is necessary, because they have been unable in any way to
find out the chief good; therefore all philosophy is found to be empty and useless, which
was unable to comprehend the nature of man, or to fulfil its duty and office.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXVI.—OF THE PHILOSOPHERS,—NAMELY, EPICURUS AND
PYTHAGORAS.</head>
<p>Since I have spoken briefly of philosophy, now also I will speak a few things about the
philosophers. This is especially the doctrine of Epicurus, that there is no providence. And
at the same time he does not deny the existence of gods. In both respects he acts contrary
to reason. For if there are gods, it follows that there is a providence. For otherwise we can
form no intelligible idea of God, for it is His peculiar province to foresee.1496 But Epicurus
says He takes no care about anything. Therefore He disregards not only the affairs of men,
but also heavenly things. How, therefore, or from what, do you affirm that He exists? For
when you have taken away the divine providence and care, it would naturally follow that
you should altogether deny the existence of God; whereas now you have left Him in name,
but in reality you have taken Him away. Whence, then, did the world derive its origin, if
God takes no care of anything? There are, he says, minute atoms, which can neither be seen
nor touched, and from the fortuitous meeting of these all things arose, and are continually
arising. If they are neither seen nor perceived by any part of the body, how could you know
of their existence? In the next place, if they exist, with what mind do they meet together to
effect anything? If they are smooth, they cannot cohere: if they are hooked and angular,
then they are divisible; for hooks and angles project, and can be cut off. But these things are
senseless and unprofitable. Why should I mention that he also makes souls capable of extinction?
who is refuted not only by all philosophers and general persuasion, but also by the
answers of bards, by the predictions of the Sibyls, and lastly, by the divine voices of the
prophets themselves; so that it is wonderful that Epicurus alone existed, who should place
the condition of man on a level with the flocks and beasts.</p>
<p>What of Pythagoras, who was first called a philosopher, who judged that souls were indeed
immortal, but that they passed into other bodies, either of cattle, or of birds, or of
beasts? Would it not have been better that they should be destroyed, together with their
bodies, than thus to be condemned to pass into the bodies of other animals? Would it not
be better not to exist at all, than, after having had the form of a man, to live as a swine or a
dog? And the foolish man, to gain credit for his saying, said that he himself had been
Euphorbus in the Trojan war, and that, when he had been slain, he passed into other figures
of animals, and at last became Pythagoras. O happy man! to whom alone so great a memory
was given; or rather unhappy, who, when changed into a sheep, was not permitted to be
ignorant of what he was! And would to Heaven that he alone had been thus senseless! He
found also some to believe him, and some indeed among the learned,1497 to whom the inheritance
of folly passed.</p>

<pb n="535"/>
<head>CHAP. XXXVII.—OF SOCRATES AND HIS CONTRADICTION.</head>
<p>After him Socrates held the first place in philosophy, who was pronounced most wise
even by the oracle, because he confessed that he knew one thing only,—namely, that he
knew nothing. And on the authority of this oracle it was right that the natural philosophers
should restrain themselves, lest they should either inquire into those things which they could
not know, or should think that they knew things which they did not know. Let us, however,
see whether Socrates was most wise, as the Pythian god proclaimed. He often made use of
this proverb, that that which is above us has also no reference to us. He has now passed
beyond the limits of his opinion. For he who said that he knew one thing only, found another
thing to speak of, as though he knew it; but that in vain. For God, who is plainly above us,
is to be sought for; and religion is to be undertaken, which alone separates us from the
brutes, which indeed Socrates not only rejected, but even derided, in swearing by a goose
and a dog, as if in truth he could not have sworn by Æsculapius, to whom he had vowed a
cock. Behold the sacrifice of a wise man! And because he was unable to offer this in his own
person, since he was at the point of death, he entreated his friends to perform the vow after
his death, lest forsooth he should be detained as a debtor in the lower regions. He assuredly
both pronounced that he knew nothing, and made good his statement.1498</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXVIII.—OF PLATO, WHOSE DOCTRINE APPROACHES MORE NEARLY
TO THE TRUTH.</head>
<p>His disciple Plato, whom Tully speaks of as the god of philosophers, alone of all so
studied philosophy that he approached nearer to the truth; and yet, because he was ignorant
of God, he so failed in many things, that no one fell into worse errors, especially because in
his books respecting the state he wished all things to be common to all. This is endurable
concerning property, though it is unjust. For it ought not to be an injury to any one, if he
possesses more than another through his own industry; or to be a profit to any one, if through
his own fault he possesses less. But, as I have said, this is capable of being endured in some
way. Shall there be a community of wives also, and of children? Shall there be no distinction
of blood, or certainty of race? Shall there be neither families, nor relationships, nor affinities,
but all things confused and indiscriminate, as in herds of cattle? Shall there be no self-restraint
in men, no chastity in women? What conjugal affection can there be in these, between whom
on either side there is no sure or peculiar1499 love? Who will he dutiful towards a father,
when he knows not from whom he was born? Who will love a son, whom he will reckon as
not his own?1500 Moreover, he opened1501 the senate house to women, and entrusted to
them warfare, magistracies, and commands.1502 But how great will be the calamity of that
city, in which women shall discharge the duties of men! But of this more fully at another
opportunity.</p>
<p>Zeno, the master of the Stoics, who praises virtue, judged that pity, which is a very great
virtue, should be cut away, as though it were a disease of the mind, whereas it is at the same
time dear to God and necessary for men. For who is there who, when placed in any evil,
would be unwilling to be pitied, and would not desire the assistance of those who might
succour them, which is not called forth so as to render aid, except by the feeling of pity?
Although he calls this humanity and piety, he does not change the matter itself, only the
name. This is the affection which has been given to man alone, that by mutual assistance
we might alleviate our weakness; and he who removes this affection reduces us to the life
of the beasts. For his assertion that all faults are equal, proceeds from that inhumanity with
which also be assails pity as a disease. For he who makes no difference in faults, either thinks
that light offences ought to be visited with severe punishments, which is the part of a cruel
judge, or that great offences should be visited with slight punishments, which is the part of
a worthless judge. In either case there is injury to the state. For if the greatest crimes are

lightly punished, the boldness of the wicked will increase, and go on to deeds of greater
daring; and if a punishment of too great severity is inflicted for slight offences, inasmuch
as no one can be exempt from fault, many citizens will incur peril, who by correction might
become better.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
<pb n="538"/>
<head>CHAP. XXXIX.—OF VARIOUS PHILOSOPHERS, AND OF THE ANTIPODES.</head>
<p>These things, truly, are of small importance, but they arise from the same falsehood.
Xenophanes said that the orb of the moon is eighteen times larger than this earth of ours;
and that within its compass is contained another earth, which is inhabited by men and animals
of every kind. About the antipodes also one can neither hear nor speak without laughter.
It is asserted as something serious, that we should believe that there are men who have their
feet opposite to ours. The ravings of Anaxagoras are more tolerable, who said that snow
was black. And not only the sayings, but the deeds, of some are ridiculous. Democritus
neglected his land which was left to him by his father, and suffered it to become a public
pasture. Diogenes with his company of dogs,1503 who professes that great and perfect virtue
in the contempt of all things, preferred to beg for his support, rather than to seek it by
honest labour, or to have any property. Undoubtedly the life of a wise man ought to be to
others an example of living. If all should imitate the wisdom of these, how will states exist?
But perhaps the same Cynics were able to afford an example of modesty, who lived with
their wives in public. I know not how they could defend virtue, who took away modesty.</p>
<p>Nor was Aristippus better than these, who, I believe, that he might please his mistress
Lais, instituted the Cyrenaic system, by which he placed the end of the chief good in bodily
pleasure, that authority might not be wanting to his faults, or learning to his vices. Are those
men of greater fortitude to be more approved, who, that they might be said to have despised
death, died by their own hands? Zeno, Empedocles, Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Democritus,
and Cato, imitating these, did not know that he who put himself to death is guilty of murder,
according to the divine right and law. For it was God who placed us in this abode of flesh:
it was He who gave us the temporary habitation of the body, that we should inhabit it as
long as He pleased. Therefore it is to be considered impious, to wish to depart from it without
the command of God. Therefore violence must not be applied to nature. He knows how to
destroy1504 His own work. And if any one shall apply impious hands to that work, and shall
tear asunder the bonds of the divine workmanship, he endeavours to flee from God, whose
sentence no one will be able to escape, whether alive or dead. Therefore they are accursed
and impious, whom I have mentioned above, who even taught what are the befitting reasons
for voluntary death; so that it was not enough of guilt that they were self-murderers, unless
they instructed others also to this wickedness.1505</p>

<head>CHAP. XL.—OF THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS.</head>
<p>There are innumerable sayings and doings of the philosophers, by which their foolishness
may be shown. Therefore, since we are unable to enumerate them all, a few will be sufficient.
It is enough that it is understood that the philosophers were neither teachers of justice, of
which they were ignorant, nor of virtue, of which they falsely boast. For what can they teach,
who often confess their own ignorance? I omit to mention Socrates, whose opinion is well
known. Anaxagoras proclaims that all things are over-spread with darkness. Empedocles
says that the paths for finding out the truth of the senses are narrow. Democritus asserts
that truth lies sunk in a deep well; and because they nowhere find it, they therefore affirm
that no wise man has as yet existed. Since, therefore, human wisdom has no existence
(Socrates says in the writings of Plato), let us follow that which is divine, and let us give
thanks to God, who has revealed and delivered it to us; and let us congratulate ourselves,
that through the divine bounty we possess the truth and wisdom, which, though sought by
so many intellects through so many ages, philosophy1506 was not able to discover.</p>
<note type="footnote">1506 Philosophia non potuit invenire. Other editions have, “philosophiam nemo potuit invenire.” [“The

<head>CHAP. XLI.—OF TRUE RELIGION AND WISDOM.</head>
<p>Now, since we have refuted false religion, which is in the worship of the gods, and false
wisdom, which is in the philosophers, let us come to true religion and wisdom. And, indeed,
we must speak of them both conjointly, because they are closely connected. For to worship
the true God, that and nothing else is wisdom. For that God who is supreme and the Maker
of all things, who made man as the image of Himself, on this account conferred on him
alone of all animals the gift of reason, that he might pay back honour to Him as his Father
and his Lord, and by the exercise of this piety and obedience might gain the reward of immortality.
This is a true and divine mystery. But among those,1507 because they are not true,
there is no agreement. Neither are sacred rites performed in philosophy, nor is philosophy
treated of in sacred things; and on this account their religion is false, because it does not
possess wisdom; and on this account their wisdom is false, because it does not possess religion.
But where both are joined together, there the truth must necessarily be; so that if it is
asked what the truth itself is, it may be rightly said to be either wise religion or religious
wisdom.</p>

<head>CHAP. XLII.—OF RELIGIOUS WISDOM: THE NAME OF CHRIST KNOWN TO
NONE, EXCEPT HIMSELF AND HIS FATHER.</head>
<p>I will now say what wise religion, or religious wisdom, is. God, in the beginning, before
He made the world, from the fountain of His own eternity, and from the divine and everlasting
Spirit,1508 begat for Himself a Son incorruptible, faithful, corresponding to His
Father’s excellence and majesty. He is virtue, He is reason, He is the word of God, He is
wisdom. With this artificer, as Hermes says, and counsellor, as the Sibyl says, He contrived
the excellent and wondrous fabric of this world. In fine, of all the angels, whom the same
God formed from His own breath,1509 He alone was admitted into a participation of His
supreme power, He alone was called God. For all things were through Him, and nothing
was without Him. In fine, Plato, not altogether as a philosopher, but as a seer, spoke concerning
the first and second God, perhaps following Trismegistus in this, whose words I
have translated from the Greek, and subjoined: “The Lord and Maker of all things, whom
we have thought to be called God, created1510 a second God, who is visible and sensible.
But by sensible I mean, not that He Himself receives sensation, but that He causes sensation
and sight. When, therefore, He had made this, the first, and one, and only one, He appeared
to Him most excellent, and full of all good qualities.” The Sibyl also says that God the guide
of all was made by God, and another, that
<lg>
<l>“God the Son of God must be known,”</l>
</lg>
as those examples which I have brought forward in my books declare. Him the prophets,
filled with the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, proclaimed; of whom especially Solomon in
the book of Wisdom, and also his father, the writer of divine hymns—both most renowned
kings, who preceded the times of the Trojan war by a hundred and eighty years1511—testify
that He was born of God. His name is known to none, except to Himself and the Father, as
John teaches in the Revelation.1512 Hermes says that His name cannot be uttered by mortal
mouth. Yet by men He is called by two names—Jesus, which is Saviour, and Christ, which
is King. He is called Saviour on this account, because He is the health and safety of all who
believe in God through Him. He is called Christ on this account, because He Himself will

Christ, who was born of God before the world, and who was born of man three hundred
years ago, I will briefly explain to you the reason. The same person is the son of God and of
man. For He was twice born: first of God, in the spirit, before the origin of the world; afterwards
in the flesh of man, in the reign of Augustus; and in connection with this fact is an
illustrious and great mystery, in which is contained both the salvation of men and the religion
of the Supreme God, and all truth. For when first the accursed and impious worship of gods
crept in through the treachery of the demons, then the religion of God remained with the
Hebrews alone, who, not by any law, but after the manner of their fathers, observed the
worship handed down to them by successive generations,1514 even until the time when they
went forth out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses, the first of all the prophets, through
whom the law was given to them from God; and they were afterwards called Jews. Therefore
they served God, being bound by the chains of the law. But they also, by degrees going astray
to profane rites, undertook the worship of strange gods, and, leaving the worship of their
father, sacrificed to senseless images. Therefore God sent to them prophets filled with the
Divine Spirit, to upbraid them with their sins and proclaim repentance, to threaten them
with the vengeance which would follow, and announce that it would come to pass, if they
persisted in the same faults, that He would send another as the bearer of a new law; and
having removed the ungrateful people from their inheritance, He would assemble to Himself
a more faithful people from foreign nations. But they not only persisted in their course, but
even slew the messengers themselves. Therefore He condemned them on account of these
deeds: nor did He any longer send messengers to a stubborn people; but He sent His own
Son, to call all nations to the favour of God. Nor, however, did He shut them out, impious
and ungrateful as they were, from the hope of salvation: but He sent Him to them before
all others,1515 that if they should by chance obey, they might not lose that which they had
received; but if they should refuse to receive their God, then, the heirs being removed,1516
the Gentiles would come into possession. Therefore the supreme Father ordered Him to
descend to the earth, and to put on a human body, that, being subject to the sufferings of
the flesh, He might teach virtue and patience not only by words, but also by deeds. Therefore
He was born a second time as man, of a virgin, without a father, that, as in His first spiritual
birth, being born of God alone, He was made a sacred spirit, so in His second and fleshly
birth, being born of a mother only, He might become holy flesh, that through Him the flesh,
which had become subject to sin, might be freed from destruction.</p>

<head>CHAP. XLIV.—THE TWOFOLD NATIVITY OF CHRIST IS PROVED FROM THE
PROPHETS.</head>
<p>That these things should thus take place as I have set them forth, the prophets had before
predicted. In the writings of Solomon it is thus written:1517 “The womb of a virgin was
strengthened, and conceived: and a virgin was impregned, and became a mother in great
pity.” In Isaiah1518 it is thus written: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and
ye shall call His name Immanuel;” which, being interpreted, is God with us.1519 For He was
with us on the earth, when He assumed flesh; and He was no less God in man, and man in
God. That He was both God and man was declared before by the prophets. That He was
God, Isaiah1520 thus declares: “They shall fall down unto Thee, they shall make supplication
unto Thee; since God is in Thee, and we knew it not, even the God of Israel. They shall be
ashamed and confounded, all of them who oppose themselves to Thee, and shall go to
confusion.” Also Jeremiah:1521 “This is our God, and there shall none other be compared
unto Him; He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His
servant, and to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among
men.” Likewise that He was man, the same Jeremiah1522 says: “And He is man, and who
knew Him?” Isaiah also thus speaks:1523 “And the Lord shall send them a man who shall
save them, and with judgment shall He heal them.” Also Moses himself in the book of
Numbers:1524 “There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a man shall arise out of Israel.” For
this cause, therefore, being God, He took upon Him flesh, that, becoming a mediator1525
between God and man, having overcome death, He might by His guidance lead man to God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XLV.—THE POWER AND WORKS OF CHRIST ARE PROVED FROM THE
SCRIPTURES.</head>
<p>We have spoken of His nativity; now let us speak of His power and works, which, when
He wrought them among men, the Jews, seeing them to be great and wonderful, supposed
that they were done by the influence of magic, not knowing that all those things which were
done by Him had been foretold by the prophets. He gave strength to the sick, and to those
languishing under various diseases, not by any healing remedy, but instantaneously, by the
force and power of His word; He restored the weak, He made the lame to walk, He gave
sight to the blind, He made the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear; He cleansed the polluted
and unclean, He restored their right mind to those who were maddened with the attack of
demons, He recalled to life and light those who were dead or now buried. He also fed and
satisfied1526 five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes. He also walked upon the
sea. He also in a tempest commanded the wind to be still, and immediately there was a calm;
all which things we find predicted both in the books of the prophets and in the verses of the
Sibyls.</p>
<p>When a great multitude resorted to Him on account of these miracles, and, as He truly
was, believed Him to be the Son of God, and sent from God, the priests and rulers of the
Jews, filled with envy, and at the same time excited with anger, because He reproved their
sins and injustice, conspired to put Him to death; and that this would happen, Solomon
had foretold a little more than a thousand years before, in the book of Wisdom, using these
words:1527 “Let us defraud the righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with
our offences against the law. He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge of God, and
he calleth himself the Son of God. He is made to reprove our thoughts: it grieveth us even
to look upon him; for his life is not like the life of others, his ways are of another fashion.
We are counted by him as triflers; he withdraweth himself from our ways, as from filthiness;
he commendeth greatly the latter end of the just, and boasteth that he has God for his father.
Let us see, therefore, if his words be true; let us prove what end he shall have; let us examine
him with rebukes and torments, that we may know his meekness and prove his patience;
let us condemn him to a shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone
astray; for their own folly hath blinded them, and they do not understand the mysteries of
God.”</p>
<p>Therefore, being unmindful of these writings which they read, they incited the people
as though against an impious man, so that they seized and led Him to trial, and with impious
words demanded His death. But they alleged against Him as a crime this very thing, that
He said that He was the Son of God, and that by healing on the Sabbath He broke the law,
<note type="footnote">1526 Saturavit.</note>
<note type="footnote">1527 Wisd. ii. 12–22. See Instit., iv. 16, p. 117, supra.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
which He said that He did not break, but fulfilled. And when Pontius Pilate, who then as
legate had authority in Syria, perceived that the cause did not belong to the office of the
Roman judge, he sent Him to Herod the Tetrarch, and permitted the Jews themselves to be
the judges of their own law: who, having received the power of punishing His guilt, sentenced1528
Him to the cross, but first scourged and struck him with their hands, put on Him
a crown of thorns, spat upon His face, gave Him gall and vinegar to eat and drink; and
amidst these things no word was heard to fall from His lips. Then the executioners, having
cast lots over His tunic and mantle, suspended Him on the cross, and affixed Him to it,
though on the next day they were about to celebrate the Passover, that is, their festival.
Which crime was followed by prodigies, that they might understand the impiety which they
had committed; for at the same moment in which He expired, there was a great earthquake,
and a withdrawing1529 of the sun, so that the day was turned into night.</p>

<head>CHAP. XLVI.—IT IS PROVED FROM THE PROPHETS THAT THE PASSION AND
DEATH OF CHRIST HAD BEEN FORETOLD.</head>
<p>And the prophets had predicted that all these things would thus come to pass. Isaiah
thus speaks:1530 “I am not rebellious, nor do I oppose: I gave my back to the scourge, and
my cheeks to the hand: I turned not away my face from the foulness of spitting.” The same
prophet says respecting His silence:1531 “I was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as
a lamb before its shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.” David also, in the xxxivth
Psalm:1532 “The abjects were gathered together against me, and they knew me not: they
were scattered, yet felt no remorse: they tempted me, and gnashed upon me with their teeth.”
The same also says respecting food and drink in the lxviiith Psalm:1533 “They gave me also
gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” Also respecting the cross
of Christ:1534 “And they pierced my hands and my feet, they numbered all my bones: they
themselves have looked and stared upon me; they parted my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture.” Moses also says in Deuteronomy:1535 “ And thy life shall hang
in doubt before thine eyes, and thou shall fear day and night, and shall have none assurance
of thy life.” Also in Numbers:1536 “God is not in doubt as a man, nor does He suffer threats
as the son of man.” Also Zechariah says:1537 “And they shall look on me whom they pierced.”
Amos1538 thus speaks of the obscuring of the sun: “In that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall
go down at noon, and the clear day shall be dark; and I will turn your feasts into mourning,
and your songs into lamentation.” Jeremiah1539 also speaks of the city of Jerusalem, in which
He suffered: “Her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been confounded and
reviled, and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword.” Nor were these things spoken
in vain. For after a short time the Emperor Vespasian subdued the Jews, and laid waste their
lands with the sword and fire, besieged and reduced them by famine, overthrew Jerusalem,
led the captives in triumph, and prohibited the others who were left from ever returning to
their native land. And these things were done by God on account of that crucifixion of
Christ, as He before declared this to Solomon in their Scriptures, saying,1540 “And Israel

every one that shall pass by shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath God done these
evils to this land, and to this house? And they shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their
God, and persecuted their King, who was dearly beloved by God, and crucified Him with
great degradation, therefore hath God brought upon them these evils.” For what would they
not deserve who put to death their Lord, who had come for their salvation?</p>

<head>CHAP. XLVII.—OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST, THE SENDING OF
THE APOSTLES, AND THE ASCENSION OF THE SAVIOUR INTO HEAVEN.</head>
<p>After these things they took His body down from the cross, and buried it in a tomb. But
on the third day, before daybreak, there was an earthquake, and the stone with which they
had closed the sepulchre was removed, and He arose. But nothing was found in the sepulchre
except the clothes in which the body had been wrapped.1542 But that He would rise again
on the third day, the prophets had long ago foretold. David, in the xvth Psalm:1543 “Thou
wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.”
Likewise Hosea:1544 This my Son is wise, therefore He shall not stay long in the anguish of
His sons: and I will ransom Him from the hand of the grave. Where is thy judgment, O
death, where is thy sting? “The same again says:1545 “After two days He will revive us on
the third day.”</p>
<p>Therefore, after His resurrection He went into Galilee, and again assembled His disciples,
who had fled through fear; and having given them commands which He wished to be observed,
and having arranged for the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world,
He breathed into them the Holy Spirit,1546 and gave them the power of working miracles,
that they might act for the welfare of men as well by deeds as words; and then at length, on
the fortieth day, He returned to His Father, being carried up into a cloud. The prophet
Daniel1547 had long before shown this, saying, “I saw in the night vision, and, behold, one
like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and
they who stood beside Him brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him a
kingdom, and glory, and dominion, and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him;
and His power is an everlasting one, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which
shall not be destroyed.” Also David in the cixth Psalm:1548 “The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”</p>

<head>CHAP. XLVIII.—OF THE DISINHERITING OF THE JEWS, AND THE ADOPTION
OF THE GENTILES.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, He sits at the right hand of God, about to tread down His enemies,
who tortured Him, when He shall come to judge the world, it is evident that no hope remains
to the Jews, unless, turning themselves to repentance, and being cleansed from the blood
with which they polluted themselves, they shall begin to hope in Him whom they denied.1549
Therefore Esdras thus speaks:1550 “This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. Consider
and let it come into your heart, that we have to abase Him in a figure: and after these things
we have hoped1551 in Him.”</p>
<p>Now that the Jews were disinherited, because they rejected Christ, and that we, who are
of the Gentiles, were adopted into their place, is proved by the Scriptures. Jeremiah1552 thus
speaks: “I have forsaken mine house, I have given mine heritage into the hands of her enemies.
Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it hath given forth its voice against
me: therefore have I hated it.” Also Malachi:1553 “I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord,
neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the
going down thereof, my name shall be great among the Gentiles.” Isaiah also thus speaks:1554
“I come to gather all nations and tongues: and they shall come and see my glory.” The same
says in another place,1555 speaking in the person of the Father to the Son: “I the Lord have
called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee
for a covenant of my people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of the blind, to bring
out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.”</p>

<pb n="551"/>
<head>CHAP. XLIX.—THAT GOD IS ONE ONLY.</head>
<p>If therefore the Jews have been rejected by God, as the faith due to the sacred writings
shows, and the Gentiles, as we see, brought in, and freed from the darkness of this present
life and from the chains of demons, it follows that no other hope is proposed to man, unless
he shall follow true religion and true wisdom, which is in Christ, and he who is ignorant of
Him is always estranged from the truth and from God. Nor let the Jews, or philosophers,
flatter themselves respecting the Supreme God. He who has not acknowledged the Son has
been unable to acknowledge the Father.1556 This is wisdom, and this is the mystery of the
Supreme God. God willed that He should be acknowledged and worshipped through Him.1557
On this account He sent the prophets beforehand to announce His coming, that when the
things which had been foretold were fulfilled in Him, then He might be believed by men to
be both the Son of God and God.</p>
<p>Nor, however, must the opinion be entertained that there are two Gods, for the Father
and the Son are one. For since the Father loves the Son, and gives all things to Him, and the
Son faithfully obeys the Father, and wills nothing except that which the Father does, it is
plain that so close a relationship cannot be separated, so that they should be said to be two
in whom there is but one substance, and will, and faith. Therefore the Son is through the
Father, and the Father through the Son. One honour is to be given to both, as to one God,
and is to be so divided through the worship of the two, that the division itself may be bound
by an inseparable bond of union. He will leave nothing to himself, who separates either the
Father from the Son, or the Son from the Father.1558</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
<pb n="552"/>
<head>CHAP. L.—WHY GOD ASSUMED A MORTAL BODY, AND SUFFERED DEATH.</head>
<p>It remains to answer those also, who deem that it was unbecoming and unreasonable
that God should be clothed with a mortal body; that He should be in subjection to men;
that He should endure insults; that He should even suffer tortures and death. I will speak
my sentiments, and I will sum up, as I shall be able, an immense subject in few words. He
who teaches anything, ought, as I think, himself to practice what he teaches, that he may
compel men to obey. For if he shall not practice them, he will detract from the faith due to
his precepts. Therefore there is need of examples, that the precepts which are given may
have firmness, and if any one shall prove contumacious, and shall say that they cannot be
carried out in practice, the instructor may refute him by actual fact.1559 Therefore a system
of teaching cannot be perfect, when it is delivered by words only; but it then becomes perfect,
when it is completed by deeds.</p>
<p>Since therefore Christ was sent to men as a teacher of virtue, for the perfection of His
teaching it was plainly befitting that He should act as well as teach. But if He had not assumed
a human body, He would not have been able to practice what He taught,—that is, not to be
angry, not to desire riches, not to be inflamed with lust, not to fear pain, to despise death.
These things are plainly virtues, but they cannot be done without flesh. Therefore He assumed
a body on this account, that, since He taught that the desires of the flesh must be overcome,
He might in person first practice it, that no one might allege the frailty of the flesh as an
excuse.</p>
<note type="footnote">1559 Præsenti opere convincat.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
<pb n="553"/>
<head>CHAP. LI.—OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST ON THE CROSS.</head>
<p>I will now speak of the mystery of the cross, lest any one should happen to say, If death
must be endured by Him, it should have been not one that was manifestly infamous and
dishonourable, but one which had some honour. I know, indeed, that many, while they
dislike the name of the cross, shrink from the truth, though there is in it great reasonableness
and power. For since He was sent for this purpose, that He might open to the lowest men
the way to salvation, He made Himself humble that He might free them. Therefore He underwent
that kind of death which is usually inflicted on the humble, that an opportunity of
imitation might be given to all. Moreover, since He was about to rise again, it was not allowable
that His body should be in any way mutilated, or a bone broken, which happens to
those who are beheaded. Therefore the cross was preferred, which reserved the body with
the bones uninjured for the resurrection.</p>
<p>To these grounds it was also added, that having undertaken to suffer and to die, it was
befitting that He should be lifted up. Thus the cross exalted Him both in fact and in emblem,
1560 so that His majesty and power became known to all, together with His passion.
For in that He extended His hands on the cross, He plainly stretched out His wings towards
the east and the west, under which all nations from either side of the world might assemble
and repose. But of what great weight this sign is, and what power it has, is evident, since all
the host of demons is expelled and put to flight by this sign. And as He Himself before His
passion put to confusion demons by His word and command, so now, by the name and sign
of the same passion, unclean spirits, having insinuated themselves into the bodies of men,
are driven out, when racked and tormented, and confessing themselves to be demons, they
yield themselves to God, who harasses them. What therefore can the Greeks expect from
their superstitions and with their wisdom, when they see that their gods, whom they do not
deny to be demons also, are subdued by men through the cross?</p>

<pb n="554"/>
<head>CHAP. LII.—THE HOPE OF THE SALVATION OF MEN CONSISTS IN THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE GOD, AND OF THE HATRED OF THE HEATHENS
AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS.</head>
<p>There is therefore but one hope of life for men, one harbour of safety, one refuge of
liberty, if, laying aside the errors by which they were held, they open the eyes of their mind
and recognise God, in whom alone is the abode of truth; despise earthly things, and those
made from the ground esteem as nothing philosophy, which is foolishness with God; and
having undertaken true wisdom, that is, religion, become heirs of immortality. But indeed
they are not so much opposed to the truth as to their own safety; and when they hear these
things, they abominate them as some inexpiable wickedness. But they do not even endure1561
to hear: they think that their ears are polluted with impiety1562 if they hear; nor do they now
refrain from reproaches, but assail them with the most insulting words; and also, if they
have obtained the power, persecute them as public enemies, yea, even as worse than enemies;
for enemies, when they have been vanquished, are punished with death or slavery; nor is
there any torturing after the laying down of arms, although those deserved to suffer all things
who wished so to act, that piety might have place among swords.</p>
<p>Cruelty, combined with innocence, is unheard of, nor is it worthy of the condition of
victorious enemies. What is the so powerful cause of this fury? Doubtless, because they
cannot contend on the ground of reason, they urge forward their cause by means of violence;
and, with the subject not understood, they condemn those as most pernicious persons who
have declined to make a stand respecting the fact of their innocence. Nor do they deem it
sufficient that those whom they unreasonably hate should die by a speedy and simple death;
but they lacerate them with refined tortures, that they may satisfy their hatred, which is not
produced by any fault, but by the truth, which is hateful to those who live wickedly, because
they take it ill that there are some whom their deeds cannot please. They desire in every way
to destroy these, that they may be able to sin without restraint in the absence of any witness.</p>

<head>CHAP. LIII.—THE REASONS OF THE HATRED AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS ARE
EXAMINED AND REFUTED.</head>
<p>But they say that they do these things for the defence of their gods. In the first place, if
they are gods, and have any power and influence, they have no need of the defence and
protection of men, but they manifestly defend themselves. Or how is man able to hope for
aid from them, if they are unable to average even their own injuries? Therefore it is a vain
and foolish thing to wish to be avengers of the gods, except that their distrust is more apparent
from this. For he who undertakes the protection of the god whom he worships, admits the
worthlessness of that god; but if he worships him on this account, because he thinks him
powerful, he ought not to wish to defend him, by whom he himself ought to be defended.
We therefore act rightly. For when those defenders of false gods, who are rebellious against
the true God, persecute His name in us, we resist not either in deed or in word, but with
meekness, and silence, and patience, we endure whatever cruelty is able to contrive against
us. For we have confidence in God, from whom we expect that retribution will hereafter
follow. Nor is this confidence ungrounded, since we have in some cases heard, and in other
cases seen, the miserable ends of all those who have dared to commit this crime. Nor has
any one had it in his power to insult God with impunity; but he who has been unwilling to
learn by word has learned by his own punishment who is the true God.</p>
<p>I should wish to know, when they compel men to sacrifice against their will, what reasoning
they have with themselves, or to whom they make that offering. If it is made to the
gods, that is not worship, nor an acceptable sacrifice, which is made by those who are displeasing
to them, which is extorted by injury, which is enforced by pain. But if it is done to
those whom they compel, it is plainly not a benefit, which any one would not receive, he
even prefers rather to die. If it is a good to which you call me, why do you invite me with
evil? why with blows, and not with words? why not by argument, but by bodily tortures?
Whence it is manifest that that is an evil, to which you do not allure me willing, but drag
me refusing. What folly is it to wish to consult the good of any one against his will! If any
one, under the pressure of evils, attempts to have recourse to death, can you, if you either
wrest the sword from his hand, or cut the halter, or drag him away from the precipice, or
pour out the poison, boast yourself as the preserver of the man, when he, whom you think
that you have preserved, does not thank you, and thinks that you have acted ill towards him,
in averting from him the death which be desired, and in not permitting him to reach the
end and rest from his labours? For a benefit ought not to be weighed according to the
quality of the action, but according to the feelings of him who receives it. Why should you
reckon as a benefit that which is an injury to me? Do you wish me to worship your gods,
which I consider deadly to myself? If it is a good, I do not envy it. Enjoy your good by
yourself. There is no reason why you should wish to succour my error, which I have undertaken
by my judgment and inclination. If it is evil, why do you drag me to a participation

<pb n="556"/>
in evil? Use your own fortune. I prefer to die in the practice of that which is good, than to
live in evil.</p>

<head>CHAP. LIV.—OF THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN THE WORSHIP OF GOD.</head>
<p>These things may indeed be said with justice. But who will hear, when men of furious
and unbridled spirit think that their authority is diminished if there is any freedom in the
affairs of men? But it is religion alone in which freedom has placed its dwelling. For it is a
matter which is voluntary above all others, nor can necessity be imposed upon any, so as to
worship that which he does not wish to worship.1563 Some one may perhaps pretend, he
cannot wish it. In short, some, through fear of torments, or overcome by tortures, have assented
to detestable sacrifices: they never do that voluntarily which they did from necessity;
but when the opportunity is again given to them, and liberty restored, they again betake
themselves to God, and appease Him with prayers and tears, repenting not of the will, which
they had not, but of the necessity which they endured; and pardon is not denied to those
who make satisfaction. What then does he accomplish who pollutes the body, since he
cannot change the will?</p>
<p>But, in fact, men of weak understanding, if they have induced any man of spirit1564 to
sacrifice to their gods, with incredible alacrity insolently exult, and rejoice, as though they
had sent an enemy under the yoke. But if any one, neither frightened by threats nor by tortures,
shall have chosen to prefer his faith to his life, cruelty puts forth all its ingenuity against
him, plans dreadful and intolerable things; and because they know that death for the cause
of God is glorious, and that this is a victory on our side, if, having overcome the torturers,
we lay down our life in behalf of the faith and religion, they also themselves strive to conquer
us. They do not put us to death, but they search out new and unheard-of tortures, that the
frailty of the flesh may yield to pains, and if it does not yield, they put off further punishment,
and apply diligent care to the wounds, that while the scars are yet fresh, a repetition of the
torture may inflict more pain; and while they practice this torture1565 upon the innocent,
they evidently consider themselves pious, and just, and religious (for they are delighted with
such sacrifices to their gods), but they term the others impious and desperate. What perversity
is this, that he who is punished, though innocent, should be called desperate and impious,
and that the torturer, on the other hand, should be called just and pious!</p>

<head>CHAP. LV.—THE HEATHENS CHARGE JUSTICE WITH IMPIETY IN FOLLOWING
GOD.</head>
<p>But they say that those are rightly and deservedly punished, who dislike the public rites
of religion handed down to them by their ancestors. What if those ancestors were foolish
in undertaking vain religious rites, as we have shown before, shall we be prohibited from
following true and better things? Why do we deprive ourselves of liberty, and become enslaved
to the errors of others, as though bound1566 to them? Let it be permitted us to be
wise, let it be permitted us to inquire into the truth. But, however, if it pleases them to defend
the folly1567 of their ancestors, why are the Egyptians suffered to escape, who worship cattle
and beasts of every kind as deities? Why are the gods themselves made the subjects of
comic1568 representations? and why is he honoured who derides them most wittily? Why
are philosophers attended to, who either say that there are no gods, or that, if there are any,
they take no interest in, and do not regard the affairs of men, or argue that there is no
providence at all, which rules the world?</p>
<p>But they alone of all are judged impious who follow God and the truth. And since this
is at once justice, and wisdom, they lay to its charge either impiety or folly, and do not perceive
what it is which deceives them, when they call evil good, and good evil. Many indeed
of the philosophers, and especially Plato and Aristotle, spoke many things about justice,
asserting and extolling that virtue with the greatest praise, because it gives to each its due,
because it maintains equity in all things; and whereas the other virtues are as it were silent,
and shut up within, that it is justice alone which is neither concerned1569 for itself only, nor
hidden, but altogether shows itself1570 abroad, and is ready for conferring a benefit, so as
to assist as many as possible: as though in truth justice ought to be in judges only, and those
placed in any post of authority, and not in all men.</p>
<p>And yet there is no one of men, not even of the lowest and of beggars, who is not capable
of justice. But because they did not know what it was, from what source it proceeded, and
what was its mode of operation, they assigned to a few only that highest virtue, that is, the
common good of all, and said that it aimed at1571 no advantages peculiar to itself, but only
the interests of others. And not without reason was Carneades raised up, a man of the greatest
talent and penetration, to refute their speech, and overthrow the justice, which had no firm

that its defenders brought forward no firm or certain argument respecting justice.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
<pb n="560"/>
<head>CHAP. LVI.—OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD.</head>
<p>For if justice is the worship of the true God (for what is so just with respect to equity,
so pious with respect to honour, so necessary with respect to safety, as to acknowledge God
as a parent, to reverence Him as Lord, and to obey His law or precepts?), it follows that the
philosophers were ignorant of justice, for they neither acknowledged God Himself, nor observed
His worship and law; and on this account they might have been refuted by Carneades,
whose disputation was to this effect, that there is no natural justice, and therefore that all
animals defended their own interests by the guidance of nature itself, and therefore that
justice, if it promotes the advantages of others and neglects its own, is to be called foolishness.
But if all people who are possessed of power, and the Romans themselves, who are masters
of the whole world, were willing to follow justice, and to restore to every one his property
which they have seized by force and arms, they will return to cottages and a condition of
want. And if they did this, they might indeed be just, but they must of necessity be considered
foolish, who proceed to injure themselves for the advantage of others. Then, if any one
should find a man who was through a mistake offering for sale gold as mountain-brass, or
silver as lead, and necessity should compel him to buy it, will he conceal his knowledge and
buy it for a small sum, or will he rather inform the seller of its value? If he shall inform him,
he will manifestly be called just; but he will also be foolish, for conferring an advantage upon
another, and injuring himself. But it is easy to judge in a case of injury. What if he shall incur
danger of his life, so that it shall be necessary for him either to kill another or to die, what
will he do? It may happen that, having suffered shipwreck, he may find some feeble person
clinging to a plank; or, his army having been defeated, in his flight he may find a wounded
man on horseback: will he thrust the one from the plank, the other from his horse, that he
himself may be able to escape? If he shall wish to be just, he will not do it; but he will also
be judged foolish, who in sparing the life of another shall lose his own. If he shall do it, he
will indeed appear wise, because he will provide for his own interests; but he will also be
wicked, because he will commit a wrong.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="52">
<pb n="561"/>
<head>CHAP. LVII.—OF WISDOM AND FOOLISHNESS.</head>
<p>These things indeed are said with acuteness; but we are able very readily to reply to
them. For the imitation of names causes it thus to appear. For justice bears a resemblance
to foolishness, and yet it is not foolishness; and at the same time malice bears a resemblance
to wisdom, and yet it is not wisdom. But as that malice is intelligent and shrewd in preserving
its own interests, it is not wisdom, but cunning and craftiness; so likewise justice ought not
to be called foolishness, but innocence, because the just man must be wise, and the foolish
man unjust. For neither reason nor nature itself permits that he who is just should not be
wise, since it is plain that the just man does nothing except that which is right and good,
and always avoids that which is perverted1572 and evil. But who will be able to distinguish
between good and evil, depravity and rectitude, but he who shall be wise? But the fool acts
badly, because he is ignorant of what is good and evil. Therefore he does wrong, because he
is unable to distinguish between things which are perverted and those which are right.
Therefore justice cannot be befitting to the foolish man, nor wisdom to the unjust. He is
not then a foolish person who has not thrust off a shipwrecked man from a plank, nor a
wounded man from his horse, because he has abstained from injury, which is a sin; and it
is the part of the wise man to avoid sin.</p>
<p>But that he should appear foolish at first sight is caused by this, that they suppose the
soul to be extinguished together with the body; and for this reason they refer all advantage
to this life. For if there is no existence after death, it is plain that he acts foolishly who spares
the life of another to his own loss, or who consults the gain of another more than his own.
If death destroys the soul, we must use our endeavours to live for a longer time, and more
to our own advantage; but if there remains after death a life of immortality and blessedness,
the just and wise man will certainly despise this corporeal existence, with all earthly goods,
because he will know what kind of a reward he is about to receive from God. Therefore let
us maintain innocency, let us maintain justice, let us undergo the appearance of foolishness,
that we may be able to maintain true wisdom. And if it appears to men senseless and foolish
to prefer torture and death rather than to sacrifice to gods, and to escape without harm, let
us however strive to exhibit faithfulness towards God by all virtue and by all patience. Let
not death terrify us, nor pain subdue us, so as to prevent the vigour of our mind and constancy
from being preserved unshaken. Let them call us foolish, whilst they themselves are
most foolish, and blind and dull, and like sheep; who do not understand that it is a deadly
thing to leave the living God, and prostrate themselves in the adoration of earthly objects;
who do not know that eternal punishment awaits those who have worshipped senseless
images; and that those who have neither refused tortures nor death for the worship and
honour of the true God will obtain eternal life. This is the highest faith; this is true wisdom;
<note type="footnote">1572 Pravum.</note>

<pb n="562"/>
this is perfect justice. It matters nothing to us what fools may judge, what trifling men may
think. We ought to await the judgment of God, that we may hereafter judge those who have
passed judgment on us.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
<pb n="563"/>
<head>CHAP. LVIII.—OF THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD, AND SACRIFICE.</head>
<p>I have spoken of justice, what was its nature. It follows that I show what is true sacrifice
to God, what is the most just manner of worshipping Him, lest any one should think that
victims, or odours, or precious gifts, are desired by God, who, if He is not subject to hunger,
and thirst, and cold, and desire of all earthly things, does not therefore make use of all these
things which are presented in temples and to gods of earth; but as corporeal offerings are
necessary for corporeal beings, so manifestly an incorporeal sacrifice is necessary for an incorporeal
being. But God has no need of those things which He has given to man for his
use, since all the earth is under His power: He needs not a temple, since the world is His
dwelling; He needs not an image, since He is incomprehensible both to the eyes and to the
mind; He needs not earthly lights, for He was able to kindle the light of the sun, with the
other stars, for the use of man. What then does God require from man but worship of the
mind, which is pure and holy? For those things which are made by the hands, or are outside
of man, are senseless, frail, and displeasing. This is true sacrifice, which is brought forth not
from the chest but from the heart; not that which is offered by the hand, but by the mind.
This is the acceptable victim, which the mind sacrifices of itself. For what do victims bestow?
What does incense? What do garments? What does silver? What gold? What precious
stones,—if there is not a pure mind on the part of the worshipper? Therefore it is justice
only which God requires. In this is sacrifice; in this the worship of God, respecting which I
must now speak, and show in what works justice must necessarily be contained.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="54">
<pb n="564"/>
<head>CHAP. LIX.—OF THE WAYS OF LIFE, AND THE FIRST TIMES OF THE WORLD.</head>
<p>That there are two ways1573 of human life was unknown neither to philosophers nor
to poets, but both introduced them in a different manner. The philosophers wished the one
to be the way of industry, the other of idleness; but in this respect they were less correct in
their statements, that they referred them to the advantages of this life only. The poets spoke
better who said that one of them was the way of the just, the other of the unjust; but they
err in this, that they say that they are not in this life, but in the shades below. We manifestly
speak more correctly, who say that the one is the way of life, the other that of death. And
here, however, we say that there are two ways; but the one on the right hand, in which the
just walk, does not lead to Elysium, but to heaven, for they become immortal; the other on
the left leads to Tartarus,1574 for the unjust are sentenced to eternal tortures. Therefore the
way of justice, which leads to life, is to be held by us. Now the first duty of justice is to acknowledge
God as a parent, and to fear Him as a master, to love Him as a father. For the
same Being who begat us, who animated us with vital breath, who nourishes and preserves
us, has over us, not only as a father but also as a master, authority to correct us, and the
power of life and death; wherefore twofold honour is due to Him from man, that is, love
combined with fear. The second duty of justice is to acknowledge man as a brother. For if
the same God made us, and produced all men on equal terms to justice and eternal life, it
is manifest that we are united by the relationship of brotherhood; and he who does not acknowledge
this is unjust. But the origin of this evil, by which the mutual society of men, by
which the bond of relationship has been torn asunder, arises from ignorance of the true
God. For he who is ignorant of that fountain of bounty can by no means be good. Hence it
is that, from the time when a multitude of gods began to be consecrated and worshipped
by men, justice, as the poets relate, being put to flight, every compact was destroyed, the
fellowship of human justice was destroyed. Then every one, consulting his own interest,
reckoned might to be right, injured another, attacked by frauds, deceived1575 by treachery,
increased his own advantages by the inconvenience of others, did not spare relatives, or
children, or parents, prepared poisoned cups for the destruction of men, beset the ways with
the sword, infested the seas, gave the rein to his lust, wherever passion led him,—in short,
esteemed nothing sacred which his dreadful desire did not violate. When these things were
done, then men instituted laws for themselves to promote the public advantage, that they
might meanwhile protect themselves from injuries. But the fear of laws did not suppress
crimes, but it checked licentiousness. For laws were able to punish offences, they were unable

<pb n="565"/>
to punish the conscience. Therefore the things which before were done openly began to be
done secretly. Justice also was evaded by stealth, since they who themselves presided over
the administration of the laws, corrupted by, gifts and rewards, made a traffic of their sentences,
either to the escape1576 of the evil or to the destruction of the good. To these things
were added dissensions, and wars, and mutual depredations; and the laws being crushed,
the power of acting with violence was assumed without restraint.</p>

<pb n="566"/>
<head>CHAP. LX.—OF THE DUTIES OF JUSTICE.</head>
<p>When the affairs of men were in this condition, God pitied us, revealed and displayed
Himself to us, that in Himself we might learn religion, faith, purity, and mercy; that having
laid aside the error of our former life, together with God Himself we might know ourselves,
whom impiety had disunited from Him, and we might choose1577 the divine law, which
unites human affairs with heavenly, the Lord Himself delivering it to us; by which law all
the errors with which we have been ensnared, together with vain and impious superstitions,
might be taken away. What we owe to man, therefore, is prescribed by that same divine law
which teaches that whatever you render to man is rendered to God. But the root of justice,
and the entire foundation of equity, is that you should not do that which you would be unwilling
to suffer, but should measure the feelings of another by your own. If it is an unpleasant
thing to bear an injury, and he who has done it appears unjust, transfer to the person of
another that which you feel respecting yourself, and to your own person that which you
judge respecting another, and you will understand that you act as unjustly if you injure another
as another would if he should injure you. If we consider these things, we shall maintain
innocence, in which the first step of justice is, as it were, contained. For the first thing is,
not to injure; the next is, to be of service. And as in uncultivated lands, before you begin to
sow, the fields must be cleansed by tearing up the thorns and cutting off all the roots of
trunks, so vices must first be thrust out from our souls, and then at length virtues must be
implanted, from which the fruits of immortality, being engendered by the word of God,
may spring up.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="56">
<pb n="567"/>
<head>CHAP. LXI.—OF THE PASSIONS.</head>
<p>There are three passions, or, so to speak, three furies, which excite such great perturbations
in the souls of men, and sometimes compel them to offend in such a manner, as to
permit them to have regard neither for their reputation nor for their personal safety: these
are anger, which desires vengeance; love of gain, which longs for riches; lust, which seeks
for pleasures. We must above all things resist these vices: these trunks must be rooted up,
that virtues may be implanted. The Stoics are of opinion that these passions must be cut off;
the Peripatetics think that they must be restrained. Neither of them judge rightly, because
they cannot entirely be taken away, since they are implanted by nature, and have a sure and
great influence; nor can they be diminished, since, if they are evil, we ought to be without
them, even though restrained and used with moderation; if they are good, we ought to use
them in their completeness.1578 But we say that they ought not to be taken away nor lessened.
For they are not evil of themselves, since God has reasonably implanted them in us; but
inasmuch as they are plainly good by nature,—for they are given us for the protection of
life,—they become evil by their evil use. And as bravery, if you fight in defence of your
country, is a good, if against your country, is an evil, so the passions, if you employ them to
good purposes, will be virtues, if to evil uses, they will be called vices. Anger therefore has
been given by God for the restraining of offences, that is, for controlling the discipline of
subjects, that fear may suppress licentiousness and restrain audacity. But they who are ignorant
of its limits are angry with their equals, or even with their superiors. Hence they rush
to deeds of cruelty, hence they rise to slaughters, hence to wars. The love of gain also has
been given that we may desire and seek for the necessaries of life. But they who are unacquainted
with its boundaries strive insatiably to heap up riches. Hence poisoning, hence
defraudings,1579 hence false wills, hence all kinds of frauds have burst forth. Moreover, the
passion of lust is implanted and innate in us for the procreation of children; but they who
do not fix its limits in the mind use it for pleasure only. Thence arise unlawful loves, thence
adulteries and debaucheries, thence all kinds of corruption. These passions, therefore, must
be kept within their boundaries and directed into their right course, in which, even though
they should be vehement, they cannot incur blame.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="57">
<pb n="568"/>
<head>CHAP. LXII.—OF RESTRAINING THE PLEASURES OF THE SENSES.</head>
<p>Anger is to be restrained when we suffer an injury, that the evil may be suppressed which
is imminent from a contest, and that we may retain two of the greatest virtues, harmlessness
and patience. Let the desire of gain be broken when we have that which is enough. For what
madness is it to labour in heaping up those things which must pass to others, either by
robbery, or theft, or by proscription, or by death? Let lust not go beyond the marriage-bed,
but be subservient to the procreation of children. For a too great eagerness for pleasure both
produces danger and generates disgrace, and that which is especially to be avoided, leads
to eternal death. Nothing is so hateful to God as an unchaste mind and an impure soul. Nor
let any one think that he must abstain from this pleasure only, quæ capitur ex foeminei
corporis copulatione, but also from the other pleasures which arise from the rest of the
senses, because they also are of themselves vicious, and it is the part of the same virtue to
despise them. The pleasure of the eyes is derived from the beauty of objects, that of the ears
from harmonious and pleasant sounds, that of the nostrils from pleasant odour, that of taste
from sweet food,—all of which virtue ought strongly to resist, lest, ensnared by these attractions,
the soul should be depressed from heavenly to earthly things, from things eternal to
things temporal, from life immortal to perpetual punishment. In pleasures of the taste and
smell there is this danger, that they are able to draw us to luxury. For he who shall be given
up to these things, either will have no property, or, if he shall have any, he will expend it,
and afterwards live a life to be abominated. But he who is carried away by hearing (to say
nothing respecting songs,1580 which often so charm the inmost senses that they even disturb
with madness a settled state of the mind by certain elaborately composed speeches and
harmonious poems, or skilful disputations) is easily led aside to impious worship. Hence it
is that they who are either themselves eloquent, or prefer to read eloquent writings, do not
readily believe the sacred writings, because they appear unpolished; they do not seek things
that are true, but things that are pleasant; nay, to them those things appear to be most true
which soothe the ears. Thus they reject the truth, while they are captivated by the sweetness
of the discourse. But the pleasure which has reference to the sight is manifold. For that which
is derived from the beauty of precious objects excites avarice, which ought to be far removed
from a wise and just man; but that which is received from the appearance of woman hurries
a man to another pleasure, of which we have already spoken above.</p>

<head>CHAP. LXIII.—THAT SHOWS ARE MOST POWERFUL TO CORRUPT THE MINDS.</head>
<p>It remains to speak of public shows, which, since they have a more powerful influence
on the corruption of the mind, ought to be avoided by the wise, and to be altogether guarded
against, because it is said that they were instituted in celebration of the honours of the gods.
For the exhibitions of shows are festivals of Saturnus. The stage belongs to Father Liber; but
the Circensian games are supposed to be dedicated to Neptunus: so that now he who takes
part in these shows appears to have left the worship of God, and to have passed over to
profane rites. But I prefer to speak of the matter itself rather than of its origin. What is so
dreadful, what so foul, as the slaughter of man? Therefore our life is protected by the most
severe laws; therefore wars are detestable. Yet custom finds how a man may commit homicide
without war, and without laws; and this is a pleasure to him, that he has avenged guilt. But
if to be present at homicide implies a consciousness of guilt, and the spectator is involved
in the same guilt as the perpetrator, then in these slaughters of gladiators, he who is a spectator
is no less sprinkled with blood than he who sheds it; nor can he be free from the guilt
of bloodshed who wished it to be poured out, or appear not to have slain, who both favoured
the slayer and asked a reward for him. What of the stage? Is it more holy,—on which comedy
converses on the subject of debaucheries and amours, tragedy of incest and parricide? The
immodest gestures also of players, with which they imitate disreputable women, teach the
lusts, which they express by dancing. For the pantomime is a school of corruption,1581 in
which things which are shameful are acted by a figurative representation,1582 that the things
which are true may be done without shame. These spectacles are viewed by youths, whose
dangerous age, which ought to be curbed and governed, is trained by these representations
to vices and sins. The circus, in truth, is considered more innocent, but there is greater
madness in this, since the minds of the spectators are transported with such great madness,
that they not only break out into revilings, but often rise to strifes, and battles, and contentions.
Therefore all shows are to be avoided, that we may be able to maintain a tranquil state
of mind. We must renounce hurtful pleasures, lest, charmed by pestilential sweetness, we
fall into the snares of death.</p>

<head>CHAP. LXIV.—THE PASSIONS ARE TO BE SUBDUED, AND WE MUST ABSTAIN
FROM FORBIDDEN THINGS.</head>
<p>Let virtue alone please us, whose reward is immortal when it has conquered pleasure.
But when the passions have been overcome and pleasures subdued labour in suppressing
other things is easy to him who is a follower of God and of truth: he will never revile, who
shall hope for a blessing from God; he will not commit perjury, lest he should mock God;
but he will not even swear, lest at any time, either by necessity or through habit, he should
fall into perjury. He will speak nothing deceitfully, nothing with dissimulation; he will not
refuse that which he has promised, nor will he promise that which he is unable to perform;
he will envy no one, since he is content with himself and with his own possessions; nor will
he take away from, or wish ill to another, upon whom, perhaps, the benefits of God are more
plenteously1583 bestowed. He will not steal, nor will he covet anything at all belonging to
another. He will not give his money to usury, for that is to seek after gain from the evils of
others; nor, however, will he refuse to lend, if necessity shall compel any one to borrow. He
must not be harsh towards a son, nor towards a slave: he must remember that he himself
has a Father and a Master. He will so act towards these as he will wish that others should
act towards him. He will not receive excessive gifts from those who have less resources than
himself; for it is not just that the estates of the wealthy should be increased by the losses of
the wretched.</p>
<p>It is an old precept not to kill, which ought not to be taken in this light, as though we
are commanded to abstain only from homicide, which is punished even by public laws. But
by the intervention of this command, it will not be permitted us to apply peril of death by
word, nor to put to death or expose an infant, nor to condemn one’s self by a voluntary
death. We are likewise commanded not to commit adultery; but by this precept we are not
only prohibited from polluting the marriage of another, which is condemned even by the
common law of nations, but even to abstain from those who prostitute their persons. For
the law of God is above all laws; it forbids even those things which are esteemed lawful, that
it may fulfil justice. It is a part of the same law not to utter false witness, and this also itself
has a wider meaning. For if false witness by falsehood is injurious to him against whom it
is spoken, and deceives him in whose presence it is spoken, we must therefore never speak
falsely, because falsehood always deceives or injures. Therefore he is not a just man who,
even without inflicting injury, speaks in idle discourse. Nor indeed is it lawful for him to
flatter, for flattery is pernicious and deceitful; but he will everywhere guard the truth. And

although this may for the present be unpleasant, nevertheless, when its advantage and use-

<head>CHAP. LXV.—PRECEPTS ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE COMMANDED,
AND OF PITY.</head>
<p>I have spoken of those things which are forbidden; I will now briefly say what things
are commanded. Closely connected with harmlessness is pity. For the former does not inflict
injury, the latter works good; the former begins justice, the latter completes it. For since the
nature of men is more feeble than that of the other animals, which God has provided with
means of inflicting violence, and with defences for repelling it, He has given to us the affection
of pity, that we might place the whole protection of our life in mutual aid. For if we are
created by one God, and descended from one man, and are thus connected by the law of
consanguinity, we ought on this account to love every man; and therefore we are bound not
only to abstain from the infliction of injury, but not even to avenge it when inflicted on us,
that there may be in us complete harmlessness. And on this account God commands us to
pray always even for our enemies. Therefore we ought to be an animal fitted for companionship
and society, that we may mutually protect ourselves by giving and receiving assistance.
For our frailty is liable to many accidents and inconveniences. Expect that that which you
see has happened to another may happen to you also. Thus you will at length be excited to
render aid, if you shall assume the mind of him who, being placed in evils, implores your
aid. If any one is in need of food, let us bestow it; if any one meets us who is naked, let us
clothe him; if any one suffers injury from one who is more powerful than himself, let us
rescue him. Let our house be open to strangers, or to those who are in need of shelter. Let
our defence not be wanting to wards, or our protection to the defenceless.1585 To ransom
captives is a great work of pity, and also to visit and comfort the sick who are in poverty. If
the helpless or strangers die, we should not permit them to lie unburied. These are the works,
these the duties, of pity; and if any one undertakes these, he will offer unto God a true and
acceptable sacrifice. This victim is more adapted for an offering to God, who is not appeased
with the blood of a sheep, but with the piety of man, whom God, because He is just, follows
up with His own law, and with His own condition. He shows mercy to him whom He sees
to be merciful; He is inexorable to him whom He sees to be harsh to those who entreat him.
Therefore, that we may be able to do all these things, which are pleasing to God, money is
to be despised, and to be transferred to heavenly treasures, where neither thief can break
through, nor rust corrupt, nor tyrant take away, but it may be preserved for us under the
guardianship of God to our eternal wealth.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="61">
<pb n="573"/>
<head>CHAP. LXVI.—OF FAITH IN RELIGION, AND OF FORTITUDE.</head>
<p>Faith also is a great part of justice; and this ought especially to be preserved by us, who
bear the name of faith, especially in religion, because God is before and to be preferred to
man. And if it is a glorious thing to undergo death in behalf of friends, of parents, and of
children, that is, in behalf of man, and if he who has done this obtains lasting memory and
praise, how much more so in behalf of God, who is able to bestow eternal life in return for
temporal death? Therefore, when a necessity of this kind happens, that we are compelled
to turn aside from God, and to pass over to the rites of the heathens, no fear, no terror should
turn us aside from guarding the faith delivered to us. Let God be before our eyes, in our
heart, by whose inward help we may overcome the pain of our flesh, and the torments applied
to our body. Then let us think of nothing else but the rewards of an immortal life. And thus,
even though our limbs should be torn in pieces, or burnt, we shall easily endure all things
which the madness of tyrannical cruelty shall contrive against us. Lastly, let us strive to undergo
death itself, not unwillingly or timidly, but willingly and undauntedly, as those who
know what glory we are about to have in the presence of God, having triumphed over the
world and coming to the things promised us; with what good things and how great
blessedness we shall be compensated for these brief evils of punishments, and the injuries
of this life. But if the opportunity of this glory shall be wanting, faith will have its reward
even in peace.</p>
<p>Therefore let it be observed in all the duties of life, let it be observed in marriage. For it
is not sufficient if you abstain from another’s bed, or from the brothel. Let him who has a
wife seek nothing further, but, content with her alone, let him guard the mysteries of the
marriage-bed chaste and undefiled. For he is equally an adulterer in the sight of God and
impure, who, having thrown off the yoke, wantons in strange pleasure either with a free
woman or a slave. But as a woman is bound by the bonds of chastity not to desire any other
man, so let the husband be bound by the same law, since God has joined together the husband
and the wife in the union of one body. On this account He has commanded that the wife
shall not be put away unless convicted of adultery, and that the bond of the conjugal compact
shall never be dissolved, unless unfaithfulness have broken it.1586 This also is added for the
completion of chastity, that there should be an absence not only of the offence, but even of
the thought. For it is evident that the mind is polluted by the desire, though unaccomplished;
and so that a just man ought neither to do, nor to wish to do, that which is unjust. Therefore
the conscience must be cleansed; for God, who cannot be deceived, inspects it. The breast
must be cleared from every stain, that it may be a temple of God, which is enlightened not
by the gleam of gold or ivory, but by the brightness of faith and purity.</p>

<head>CHAP. LXVII.—OF REPENTANCE, THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AND OF
PROVIDENCE.</head>
<p>But it is true all these things are difficult to man, nor does the condition of his frailty
permit that any one should be without blemish. Therefore the last remedy is this, that we
have recourse to repentance, which has not the least place among the virtues, because it is
a correction of oneself; that when we have happened to fail either in deed or in word, we
may immediately come to a better mind, and confess that we have offended, and entreat
pardon from God, which according to His mercy He will not deny, except to those who
persist in their error. Great is the aid, great the solace of repentance. That is the healing of
wounds and offences, that hope, that the harbour of safety; and he who takes away this cuts
off from himself the way of salvation, because no one can be so just that repentance is never
necessary for him. But we, even though there is no offence of ours, yet ought to confess to
God, and to entreat pardon for our faults, and to give thanks even in evils. Let us always
offer this obedience to our Lord. For humility is dear and lovely in the sight of God; for
since He rather receives the sinner who confesses his fault, than the just man who is haughty,
how much more will He receive the just man who confesses, and exalt him in His heavenly
kingdom in proportion to his humility! These are the things which the worshipper of God
ought to hold forth; these are the victims, this the sacrifice, which is acceptable; this is true
worship, when a man offers upon the altar of God the pledges of his own mind. That supreme
Majesty rejoices in such a worshipper as this, as it takes him as a son and bestows upon him
the befitting reward of immortality, concerning which I must now speak, and refute the
persuasion of those who think that the soul is destroyed together with the body. For inasmuch
as they neither knew God nor were able to perceive the mystery of the world, they did not
even comprehend the nature of man and of the soul. For how could they see the consequences,
who did not hold the main point?1587 Therefore, in denying the existence of a
providence, they plainly denied the existence of God, who is the fountain and source of all
things. It followed that they should either affirm that those things which exist have always
existed, or were produced of their own accord, or arose from a meeting together of minute
seeds.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that that which exists, and is visible, always existed; for it cannot exist
of itself without some beginning. But nothing can be produced of its own accord, because
there is no nature without one who generates it. But how could there be original1588 seeds,
since both the seeds arise from objects,1589 and, in their turn, objects from seeds? Therefore
there is no seed which has not origin. Thus it came to pass, that when they supposed that
<note type="footnote">1587 Summam. Lactantius uses this word to express a compendious summary of divine mysteries.</note>

<pb n="575"/>
the world was produced by no providence, they did not suppose that even man was produced
by any plan.1590 But if no plan was made use of in the creation of man, therefore the soul
cannot be immortal. But others, on the other hand, thought there was but one God, and
that the world was made by Him, and made for the sake of men, and that souls are immortal.
But though they entertained true sentiments, nevertheless they did not perceive the causes,
or reasons, or issues of this divine work and design, so as to complete the whole mystery of
the truth, and to comprise it within some limit. But that which they were not able to do,
because they did not hold the truth in its integrity,1591 must be done by us, who know it on
the announcement of God.</p>

<head>CHAP. LXVIII.—OF THE WORLD, MAN, AND THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD.</head>
<p>Let us therefore consider what was the plan of making this so great and so immense a
work. God made the world, as Plato thought, but he does not show why He made it. Because
He is good, he says, and envying no one, He made the things which are good. But we see
that there are both good and evil things in the system of nature. Some perverse person may
stand forth, such as that atheist Theodorus was, and answer Plato: Nay, because He is evil,
He made the things which are evil. How will he refute him? If God made the things which
are good, whence have such great evils burst forth, which, for the most part, even prevail
over those which are good? They were contained, he says, in the matter. If there were evil,
therefore there were also good things; so that either God made nothing, or if He made only
good things, the evil things which were not made are more eternal than the good things
which had a beginning. Therefore the things which at one time began will have an end, and
those which always existed will be permanent. Therefore evils are preferable. But if they
cannot be preferable, they cannot indeed be more eternal. Therefore they either always existed,
and God has been inactive,1592 or they both flowed from one source. For it is more
in accordance with reason that God made all things, than that He made nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the sentiments of Plato, the same God is both good, because
He made good things, and evil, because He made evil things. And if this cannot be so, it is
evident that the world was not made by God on this account, because He is good. For He
comprised all things, both good and evil; nor did He make anything for its own sake, but
on account of something else. A house is built not for this purpose only, that there may be
a house, but that it may receive and shelter an inhabitant. Likewise a ship is built not for
this purpose, that it may appear only to be a ship, but that men may be able to sail in it.
Vessels also are made, not only that the vessels may exist, but that they may receive things
which are necessary for use. Thus also God must have made the world for some use. The
Stoics say that it was made for the sake of men; and rightly so. For men enjoy all these good
things which the world contains in itself. But they do not explain why men themselves were
made, or what advantage Providence, the Maker of all things, has in them.</p>
<p>Plato also affirms that souls are immortal, but why, or in what manner, or at what time,
or by whose instrumentality they attain to immortality, or what is the nature of that great
mystery, why those who are about to become immortal are previously born mortal, and
then, having completed the course1593 of their temporal life, and having laid aside the covering1594
of their frail bodies, are transferred to that eternal blessedness,—of all this he has
no comprehension. Finally, he did not explain the judgment of God, nor the distinction

between the just and the unjust, but supposed that the souls which have plunged themselves
into crimes are condemned thus far, that they may be reproduced in the lower animals, and
thus atone for their offences, until they again return to the forms of men, and that this is
always taking place, and that there is no end of this transmigration. In my opinion, he introduces
some sport resembling a dream, in which there appears to be neither plan, nor government
of God, nor any design.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="64">
<pb n="578"/>
<head>CHAP. LXIX.—THAT THE WORLD WAS MADE ON ACCOUNT OF MAN, AND
MAN ON ACCOUNT OF GOD.</head>
<p>I will now say what is that chief1595 point which not even those who spoke the truth
were able to connect together, bringing into one view causes and reasons. The world was
made by God, that men might be born; again, men are born, that they may acknowledge
God as a Father, in whom is wisdom; they acknowledge Him, that they may worship Him,
in whom is justice; they worship Him, that they may receive the reward of immortality; they
receive immortality, that they may serve God for ever. Do you see how closely connected
the first are with the middle, and the middle with the last? Let us look into them separately,
and see whether they are consistent1596 with each other. God made the world on account
of man. He who does not see this, does not differ much from a beast. Who but man looks
up to the heaven? who views with admiration the sun, who the stars, who all the works of
God? Who inhabits the earth? who receives the fruit from it? Who has in his power the
fishes, who the winged creatures, who the quadrupeds, except man? Therefore God made
all things on account of man, because all things have turned out for the use of man.</p>
<p>The philosophers saw this, but they did not see the consequence, that He made man
himself on His own account. For it was befitting, and pious, and necessary, that since He
contrived such great works for the sake of man, when He gave him so much honour, and
so much power, that he should bear rule in the world, man should both acknowledge God,
the Author of such great benefits, who made the world itself on his account, and should pay
Him the worship and honour due to Him. Here Plato erred; here he lost the truth which he
had at first laid hold of, when he was silent concerning the worship of that God whom he
confessed to be the framer and parent of all things, and did not understand that man is
bound to God by the ties of piety, whence religion itself receives its name, and that this is
the only thing on account of which souls become immortal. He perceived, however, that
they are eternal, but he did not descend by the regular gradations to that opinion. For the
middle arguments being taken away, he rather fell into the truth, as though by some abrupt
precipice; nor did he advance further, since he had found the truth by accident, and not by
reason. Therefore God is to be worshipped, that by means of religion, which is also justice,
man may receive from God immortality, nor is there any other reward of a pious mind; and
if this is invisible, it cannot be presented by the invisible God with any reward but that which
is invisible.</p>

<pb n="579"/>
<head>CHAP. LXX.—THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS CONFIRMED.</head>
<p>It may in truth be collected from many arguments that souls are eternal. Plato says that
that which always moves by itself, and has no beginning of motion, also has no end; but
that the soul of man always moves by itself, and because it is flexible for reflection, subtle
for discovery, easy of perception, adapted to learning, and because it retains the past, comprehends
the present, foresees the future, and embraces the knowledge of many subjects
and arts, that it is immortal, since it contains nothing which is mixed with the contagion of
earthly weight. Moreover, the eternity of the soul is understood from virtue and pleasure.
Pleasure is common to all animals, virtue belongs only to man; the former is vicious, the
latter is honourable; the former is in accordance with nature, the latter is opposed to nature,
unless the soul is immortal. For in defence of faith and justice, virtue neither fears want,
nor is alarmed at exile, nor dreads imprisonment, nor shrinks from pain, nor refuses death;
and because these things are contrary to nature, either virtue is foolishness, if it stands in
the way of advantages, and is injurious to life; or if it is not foolishness, then the soul is immortal,
and despises present goods, because other things are preferable which it attains after
the dissolution of the body. But that is the greatest proof of immortality, that man alone has
the knowledge of God. In the dumb animals there is no notion1597 of religion, because they
are earthly and bent down to the earth. Man is upright, and beholds the heaven for this
purpose, that he may seek God. Therefore he cannot be other than immortal, who longs for
the immortal. He cannot be liable to dissolution, who is connected1598 with God both in
countenance and mind. Finally, man alone makes use of the heavenly element, which is fire.
For if light is through fire, and life through light, it is evident that he who has the use of fire
is not mortal, since this is closely connected, this is intimately related to Him without whom
neither light nor life can exist.</p>
<p>But why do we infer from arguments that souls are eternal, when we have divine testimonies?
For the sacred writings and the voices of the prophets teach this. And if this appears
to any one insufficient, let him read the poems of the Sibyls, let him also weigh the answers
of the Milesian Apollo, that he may understand that Democritus, and Epicurus, and
Dicæarchus raved, who alone of all mortals denied that which is evident. Having proved
the immortality of the soul, it remains to teach by whom, and to whom, and in what manner,
and at what time, it is given. Since fixed and divinely appointed times have begun to be filled
up, a destruction and consummation of all things must of necessity take place, that the world
may be renewed by God. But that time is at hand, as far as may be collected from the number
of years, and from the signs which are foretold by the prophets. But since the things which
have been spoken concerning the end of the world and the conclusion of the times are innu-
<note type="footnote">1597 Suspicio.</note>
<note type="footnote">1598 Cum Deo communis est.</note>

<pb n="580"/>
merable, those very things which are spoken are to be laid down without adornment, since
it would be a boundless task to bring forward the testimonies. If any one wishes for them,
or does not place full confidence in us, let him approach to the very shrine of the heavenly
letters, and being more fully instructed through their trustworthiness, let him perceive that
the philosophers have erred, who thought either that this world was eternal, or that there
would be numberless thousands of years from the time when it was prepared. For six
thousand years have not yet been completed, and when this number shall be made up, then
at length all evil will be taken away, that justice alone may reign. And how this will come to
pass, I will explain in few words.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="66">
<pb n="581"/>
<head>CHAP. LXXI.—OF THE LAST TIMES.</head>
<p>These things are said by the prophets, but as seers, to be about to happen. When the
last end shall begin to approach to the world, wickedness will increase; all kinds of vices and
frauds will become frequent; justice will perish; faith, peace, mercy, modesty, truth, will
have no existence; violence and daring will abound; no one will have anything, unless it is
acquired by the hand, and defended by the hand. If there shall be any good men, they will
be esteemed as a prey and a laughing-stock. No one will exhibit filial affection to parents,
no one will pity an infant or an old man; avarice and lust will corrupt all things. There will
be slaughter and bloodshed. There will be wars, and those not only between foreign and
neighbouring states, but also intestine wars. States will carry on wars among themselves,
every sex and age will handle arms. The dignity of government will not be preserved, nor
military discipline; but after the manner of robbery, there will be depredation and devastation.
Kingly power will be multiplied, and ten men will occupy, portion out, and devour the
world. There will arise another by far more powerful and wicked, who, having destroyed
three, will obtain Asia, and having reduced and subdued the others under his own power,
will harass all the earth. He will appoint new laws, abrogate old ones; he will make the state
his own, and will change the name and seat of the government.</p>
<p>Then there will be a dreadful and detestable time, in which no one would choose to live.
In fine, such will be the condition of things, that lamentation will follow the living, and
congratulation the dead. Cities and towns will be destroyed, at one time by fire and the
sword, at another by repeated earthquakes; now by inundation of waters, now by pestilence
and famine. The earth will produce nothing, being barren either through excessive cold or
heat. All water will be partly changed into blood, partly vitiated by bitterness, so that none
of it can be useful for food, or wholesome for drinking. To these evils will also be added
prodigies from heaven, that nothing may be wanting to men for causing fear. Comets will
frequently appear. The sun will be overshadowed with perpetual paleness. The moon will
be stained with blood, nor will it repair the losses of its light taken away. All the stars will
fall, nor will the seasons preserve their regularity, winter and summer being confused. Then
both the year, and the month, and the day will be shortened. And Trismegistus has declared
that this is the old age and decline of the world. And when this shall have come, it must be
known that the time is at hand in which God will return to change the world. But in the
midst of these evils there will arise an impious king, hostile not only to mankind, but also
to God. He will trample upon, torment, harass and put to death those who have been spared
by that former tyrant. Then there will be ever-flowing tears, perpetual wailings and lamentations,
and useless prayers to God; there will be no rest from fear, no sleep for a respite. The
day will always increase disaster, the night alarm. Thus the world will be reduced almost to
solitude, certainly to fewness of men. Then also the impious man will persecute the just and
those who are dedicated to God, and will give orders that he himself shall be worshipped as

<pb n="582"/>
God. For he will say that he is Christ, though he will be His adversary.1599 That he may be
believed, he will receive the power of doing wonders, so that fire may descend from heaven,
the sun retire from his course, and the image which he shall have set up may speak. And by
these prodigies he shall entice many to worship him, and to receive his sign in their hand
or forehead. And he who shall not worship him and receive his sign will die with refined
tortures. Thus he will destroy nearly two parts, the third will flee into desolate solitudes. But
he, frantic and raging with implacable anger, will lead an army and besiege the mountain
to which the righteous shall have fled. And when they shall see themselves besieged, they
will implore the aid of God with a loud voice, and God shall hear them, and shall send to
them a deliverer.</p>

<p>Then the heaven shall be opened in a tempest,1601 and Christ shall descend with great
power, and there shall go before Him a fiery brightness and a countless host of angels, and
all that multitude of the wicked shall be destroyed, and torrents of blood shall flow, and the
leader himself shall escape, and having often renewed his army, shall for the fourth time
engage in battle, in which, being taken, with all the other tyrants, he shall be delivered up
to be burnt. But the prince also of the demons himself, the author and contriver of evils,
being bound with fiery chains, shall be imprisoned, that the world may receive peace, and
the earth, harassed through so many years, may rest. Therefore peace being made, and every
evil suppressed, that righteous King and Conqueror will institute a great judgment on the
earth respecting the living and the dead, and will deliver all the nations into subjection to
the righteous who are alive, and will raise the righteous dead to eternal life, and will Himself
reign with them on the earth, and will build the holy city, and this kingdom of the righteous
shall be for a thousand years. Throughout that time the stars shall be more brilliant, and the
brightness of the sun shall be increased, and the moon shall not be subject to decrease. Then
the rain of blessing shall descend from God at morning and evening, and the earth shall
bring forth all her fruit without the labour of men. Honey shall drop from rocks, fountains
of milk and wine shall abound. The beasts shall lay aside their ferocity and become mild,
the wolf shall roam among the flocks without doing harm, the calf shall feed with the lion,
the dove shall be united with the hawk, the serpent shall have no poison; no animal shall
live by bloodshed. For God shall supply to all abundant and harmless1602 food. But when
the thousand years shall be fulfilled, and the prince of the demons loosed, the nations will
rebel against the righteous, and an innumerable multitude will come to storm the city of
the saints. Then the last judgment of God will come to pass against the nations. For He will
shake the earth from its foundations, and the cities shall be overthrown, and He shall rain
upon the wicked fire with brimstone and hail, and they shall be on fire, and slay each other.
But the righteous shall for a little space be concealed under the earth, until the destruction
of the nations is accomplished, and after the third day they shall come forth, and see the
plains covered with carcases. Then there shall be an earthquake, and the mountains shall
be rent, and valleys shall sink down to a profound depth, and into this the bodies of the dead
shall be heaped together, and its name shall be called Polyandrion.1603 After these things

presented with the garment of immortality, they may serve God for ever; and this will be
the kingdom of God, which shall have no end. Then also the wicked shall rise again, not to
life but to punishment; for God shall raise these also, when the second resurrection takes

<head>CHAP. LXXIII.—THE HOPE OF SAFETY IS IN THE RELIGION AND WORSHIP OF
GOD.</head>
<p>Wherefore, since all these things are true and certain, in harmony with the predicted
announcement of the prophets, since Trismegistus and Hystaspes and the Sibyls have foretold
the same things, it cannot be doubted that all hope of life and salvation is placed in the religion
of God alone. Therefore, unless a man shall have received Christ, whom God has sent,
and is about to send for our redemption, unless he shall have known the Supreme God
through Christ, unless he shall have kept His commandments and law, he will fall into those
punishments of which we have spoken. Therefore frail things must be despised, that we may
gain those which are substantial; earthly things must be scorned, that we may be honoured
with heavenly things; temporal things must be shunned, that we may reach those which are
eternal. Let every one train himself to justice, mould himself to self-restraint, prepare himself
for the contest, equip himself for virtue, that if by any chance an adversary shall wage war,
he may be driven from that which is upright and good by no force, no terror, and no tortures,
may give1604 himself up to no senseless fictions, but in his uprightness acknowledge the
true and only God, may cast away pleasures, by the attractions of which the lofty soul is
depressed to the earth, may hold fast innocency, may be of service to as many as possible,
may gain for himself incorruptible treasures by good works, that he may be able, with God
for his judge, to gain for the merits of his virtue either the crown of faith, or the reward of
immortality.</p>

<p>I.
(Princes and kings, p. 13.)</p>
<p>How memorable the histories, moreover, of Nebuchadnezzar1605 and his decrees; of
Darius1606 and his also; but especially of Cyrus and his great monumental edict!1607 The
beautiful narratives of the Queen of Sheba and of the Persian consort of Queen Esther
(probably Xerxes) are also manifestations of the ways of Providence in giving light to the
heathen world through that “nation of priests” in Israel.</p>
<p>But Lactantius, who uses the Sibyls so freely, should not have omitted to show what
Sibylline oracles God drew forth from “the princes of this world” also, by the illumination
of the pharos which he established in Sion, “to be a light to lighten the Gentiles” until the
great Epiphany should rise upon them in “the dayspring from on high.”</p>
<p>I extract from a paradoxical but most entertaining author, whom I have often quoted,
certain extracts from Philo, which I translate from his note in the Soirées. Thus:—</p>
<p>“Agrippa,” says Philo,1608 “having visited Jerusalem in Herod’s time, was enchanted by
the religion of the Jews, and could never cease to speak of it.…Augustus ordered that every
day, at his own expense, and under the legal forms, a bull and two lambs should be offered
in holocaust to the Most High God on the altar at Jerusalem, though he knew that it contained
no image, whether exposed or within the veil; for this great prince, surpassed by none in
the philosophic spirit, felt the actual necessity in this world of an altar dedicated to a God
invisible.”</p>
<p>Philo also says:—</p>
<p>“Your great-grandmother Julia1609 also made superb presents to the temple; and although
women very reluctantly detach themselves from images, and rarely conceive of anything
apart from sensation, this lady, nevertheless, greatly superior to her sex in culture and in
natural endowments, arrived at that point in which she preferred to contemplate such things
in the mind rather than in sensible objects, regarding these as mere shadows of the realities.”</p>
<p>In the same discourse, wasting words on Caligula, Philo reminds him that Augustus
“not only admired, nay, rather, he adored (εθαύμαζε καὶ προσέκυνει, κ.τ.λ.), this custom
of employing no sort of image to represent, materially, a nature invisible in itself.” Poor De
Maistre, who quotes this testimony against images from Philo with intense appreciation,

will yet sophisticate himself and others into the very contrary in behalf of his one predominant
idea of (προσκύνησις) canine self-abasement to the decrees of the Vatican. On this
account I am forced to consider him a sophist as well as a fanatic; but I delight to render
justice to his genius, for, wherever he talks and reasons as a Christian merely, he fascinates
and instructs me. He never conceived of “Catholicity,” and lived under the delusion of the
Decretals, a disciple of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>II.
(Therefore they were neglected for many ages, p. 116.)</p>
<p>The explicit statements of Lactantius, and his profuse quotations from the Sibyllina,
persuade me that these curious fragments deserve a degree of scientific attention which they
have not yet received. The Fathers all cite them, when it must have exposed them to scorn
and overwhelming refutation had their quotations not been found in the Sibylline books of
their adversaries. The influence of the Jewish religion upon the Gentiles under the Babylonian
and Medo-Persian monarchies must have been considerable, but after Alexander’s
time it was vastly increased. Many versions of select prophets were doubtless produced in
Greek before the authorized Septuagint. These were soon embedded in the Sibyls’ books;
and I cannot think the interpolations of early Christians were all frauds, by any means. Their
numerous marginal annotations crept into other copies; and very likely, in the time of our
author, they were inextricably confused with the text in the greater part of the “editions,”
so to speak, then current with booksellers.</p>
<p>But in vol. viii. we shall have occasion to recur again to this interesting inquiry.</p>

<p>III.
(We made proclamation before him as children, p. 117.)</p>
<p>“Sicut pueri.” This is not according to the Septuagint, ὡς παιδίον. It is not the Vulgate,
of course; but its radical difference with that raises interesting inquiries: Is it a specimen of
one of many African or old Italic versions? Does our author endeavour to translate from
the Septuagint? May he not have had in hand a copy of Isaiah from among those which
preceded the Septuagint?</p>
<p>The Septuagint reading finds its key in cap. lii. 7, and in the tenth verse, where the “Arm
of the Lord” (“His Holy Arm”) is introduced as the personal Logos Incarnate. The thirteenth
and fourteenth verses predict the amazing sequel, and its practical and blessed results; and
then begins cap. liii., “Who hath believed” our message. To whom is “the Arm of the Lord”
revealed? “Going before Him (i.e., as heralds), we have proclaimed Him as a child, and, as
it were, a root in a thirsty land; He has no form nor glory,” etc. In other words, “We have
prophesied of Him who is elsewhere predicted (“unto us a child is born”) as one who from
His childhood is as a rush without water,—prematurely withered,—a man of sorrows, and
the Carpenter’s Son.”</p>

<pb n="588"/>
<p>It does not hint, therefore, the “obscurity” of the Messiah’s birth, but rather what Irenæus
insists upon, i.e., His (premature) old age; the worn and stricken appearance of senility in
comparative youth.1610 This is just what the messengers (Isa. lii. 7) had said in their proclamation
(Isa. lii. 14) just before: “His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form
more than the sons of men.”</p>

<p>IV.
(There was darkness, etc., pp. 122, 240.)</p>
<p>In former instances, where thought has turned to Phlegon the Trallian,1611 I have failed
to refer to an author whose excess of candour sometimes gives away more than is called for,
in questions on which adversaries have contrived to fasten undue importance, in order to
elicit indiscreet defences. But it is due to my readers that I should refer them to a most
learned work, to be found in public libraries only, by my revered friend and instructor Dr.
Jarvis. The sixth chapter (part ii.) of his Chronological Introduction to Church History1612
is devoted to this matter, and I can do no better than give the summary of its contents as
follows:—</p>
<p>“Who Phlegon was; his work lost; extracts from it by Julius Africanus and Eusebius;
their works, containing these extracts, lost; all we know is from versions and later writers;
collation of extracts as given by the Armenian version of the Chronicon of Eusebius, St.
Jerome’s Latin version, the Chronographia of Syncellus, and the Chronicon Paschale; extract
by Syncellus from Julius Africanus; remarks upon it; testimony of Origen concerning
Phlegon’s account; of John Philoponus (St. Maximus) Malala; summary of the whole; account
of Phlegon’s testimony; not noticed by the learned and voluminous writers of the fourth
and fifth centuries when they speak of the darkness, etc.; Dr. Lardner’s judgment1613 adopted.”</p>
<p>Lardner’s view, it will be observed, is thus sustained by an independent and most competent
critic. This decision puts honour on the early writers: he thinks they were unwilling
to claim a corroboration from evidence about which they were not well assured.</p>

<p>V.
(Divine and ethnic oracles, p. 210, note 2; p. 112, note 9.)</p>
<p>The whole subject of ethnic oracles needs fresh study and illustration. Nothing would
be more fascinating in theological inquiry, and Divine Inspiration might be richly illustrated

by it, as anatomical science is clarified by “comparative anatomy.” I commend this subject
to men of faith, learning, and intellectual vigour. Notably, let it be observed: (1) That Balaam’s
ass is instanced by St. Peter as miraculously enabled to rebuke the madness of his master;
and the same Apostle shortly before gives us the law as to divine inspiration in contrast.1614
(2) Balaam himself, as mechanically as the beast he rode,1615 had his own mouth opened
(see Num. xxiv. 16–19). (3) The wicked Caiaphas in like manner (St. John xi. 51, 52) spoke
prophetically, “not of himself.” (4) St. Paul (Acts xvii. 28) quotes a heathen oracle very much
as does our author.1616 Now, in view of the boldness with which the early Christians follow
the example of the Apostle in quoting the Orphica and Sibyllina, I cannot imagine that these
citations were not honestly believed by them to be oracles of a certain sort, by which God
permitted the heathen to be enlightened.1617 Observe our author’s moderate but most
pregnant remark about such inspiration (on p. 170, supra, note 8), “almost with a divine
voice;” then (on p. 192) compare other almost inspired words of poor Tully (at note 2), and
of Seneca also.1618</p>
<p>Finally, and to close the subject, the reader will readily forgive me for introducing the
following citations from the “Warburton Lecture” of Dr. Edersheim, on Prophecy and History1619
in Relation to the Messiah Discussing the pseudepigraphic writings (in Lecture Eleventh),
he says as follows:1620—</p>
<p>“The Sibylline oracles, in Greek hexameters, consist, in their present form, of twelve
books. They are full of interpolations, the really ancient portions forming part of the first
two books and the largest part of book third (verses 97–807). These sections are deeply imbued
with the Messianic spirit.1621 They date from about the year 140 before our era, while another
small portion of the same book is supposed to date from the year 32 b.c.</p>
<p>“As regards the promise of the Messiah, we turn in the first place, and with special interest,
to the Sibylline Oracles. In the third book of these (such portions as I shall quote date
from about 140 b.c.) the Messiah is described as ‘the King sent from heaven, who would
judge every man in blood and splendour of fire.’ And the Vision of Messianic times opens

with a reference to ‘the King whom God will send from the Sun,’ where we cannot fail to
perceive a reference to the Seventy-second Psalm,1622 especially as we remember that the
Greek of the Seventy, which must have been present to the Hellenist Sibyl, fully adapted the
Messianic application of the passage to a premundane Messiah. We also think of the picture
drawn in the prophecies of Isaiah. According to the Sibylline books, King Messiah was not
only to come, but He was to be specifically sent of God. He is supermundane, a King and a
Judge1623 of superhuman glory and splendour. And, indeed, that a superhuman kingdom,
such as the Sibylline oracles paint, should have a superhuman king, seems only a natural
and necessary inference.…If, as certain modern critics contend, the book of Daniel is not
authentic,1624 but dates from Maccabean times, …it may well be asked to what king the
Sibylline oracles point, for they certainly date from that period; and what is the relationship
between the (supposed Maccabean) prophecies of the book of Daniel and the certainly
Messianic anticipations of the undoubted literature of that period?”</p>
<p>Dr. Edersheim gives us the reference in the margin, to which I would call attention, as
directing to the whole pseudepigraphic literature.1625 But who can wonder, after what we
thus learn, that Constantine1626 was so profoundly impressed with Virgil’s Pollio? In spite

<head>A TREATISE ON THE ANGER OF GOD</head>
<p>ADDRESSED TO DONATUS.1628</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="592"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—OF DIVINE AND HUMAN WISDOM.</head>
<p>I have often observed, Donatus, that many persons hold this opinion, which some
philosophers also have maintained, that God is not subject to anger; since the divine nature
is either altogether beneficent, and that it is inconsistent with His surpassing and excellent
power to do injury to any one; or, at any rate, He takes no notice of us at all, so that no advantage
comes to us from His goodness, and no evil from His ill-will. But the error of these
men, because it is very great, and tends to overthrow the condition of human life, must be
refuted by us, lest you yourself also should be deceived, being incited by the authority of
men who deem themselves wise. Nor, however, are we so arrogant as to boast that the truth
is comprehended by our intellect; but we follow the teaching of God, who alone is able to
know and to reveal secret things. But the philosophers, being destitute of this teaching, have
imagined that the nature of things can be ascertained by conjecture. But this is impossible;
because the mind of man, enclosed in the dark abode of the body, is far removed from the
perception of truth: and in this the divine nature differs from the human, that ignorance is
the property of the human, knowledge of the divine nature.</p>
<p>On which account we have need of some light to dispel the darkness by which the reflection
of man is overspread, since, while we live in mortal flesh, we are unable to divine by
our senses. But the light of the human mind is God, and he who has known and admitted
Him into his breast will acknowledge the mystery of the truth with an enlightened heart;
but when God and heavenly instruction are removed, all things are full of errors. And
Socrates, though he was the most learned of all the philosophers, yet, that he might prove
the ignorance of the others, who thought that they possessed something, rightly said that
he knew nothing, except one thing—that he knew nothing. For he understood that that
learning had nothing certain, nothing true in itself; nor, as some imagine, did he pretend1629
to learning that he might refute others, but he saw the truth in some measure. And he testified
even on his trial (as is related by Plato) that there was no human wisdom. He so despised,
derided, and cast aside the learning in which the philosophers then boasted, that he professed
that very thing as the greatest learning, that he had learnt that he knew nothing. If, therefore,
there is no human wisdom, as Socrates taught, as Plato handed down, it is evident that the
knowledge of the truth is divine, and belongs to no other than to God. Therefore God must
be known, in whom alone is the truth. He is the Parent of the world, and the Framer of all
things; who is not seen with the eyes, and is scarcely distinguished by the mind; whose religion
is accustomed to be attacked in many ways by those who have neither been able to attain
true wisdom, nor to comprehend the system of the great and heavenly secret.</p>

<head>CHAP. II.—OF THE TRUTH AND ITS STEPS, AND OF GOD.</head>
<p>For since there are many steps by which the ascent is made to the abode of truth, it is
not easy for any one to reach the summit. For when the eyes are darkened by the brightness
of the truth, they who are unable to maintain a firm step fall back to the level ground.1630
Now the first step is to understand false religions, and to throw aside the impious worship
of gods which are made by the hand of man. But the second step is to perceive with the
mind that there is but one Supreme God, whose power and providence made the world
from the beginning, and afterwards continues to govern it. The third step is to know His
Servant and Messenger,1631 whom He sent as His ambassador to the earth, by whose
teaching being freed from the error in which we were held entangled, and formed to the
worship of the true God, we might learn righteousness. From all of these steps, as I have
said, there is a rapid and easy gliding to a downfall,1632 unless the feet are firmly planted
with unshaken stedfastness.</p>
<p>We see those shaken off from the first step, who, though they understand things which
are false, do not, however, discover that which is true; and though they despised earthly and
frail images, do not betake themselves to the worship of God, of whom they are ignorant.
But viewing with admiration the elements of the universe, they worship the heaven, the
earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and the other heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>But we have already reproved their ignorance in the second book of the Divine Institutes.
1633 But we say that those fall from the second step, who, though they understand that
there is but one Supreme God, nevertheless, ensnared by the philosophers, and captivated
by false arguments, entertain opinions concerning that excellent majesty far removed from
the truth; who either deny that God has any figure, or think that He is moved by no affection,
because every affection is a sign of weakness, which has no existence in God. But they are
precipitated from the third step, who, though they know the Ambassador of God, who is
also the Builder of the divine and immortal temple,1634 either do not receive Him, or receive
Him otherwise than faith demands; whom we have partly refuted in the fourth book of the
above-named work.1635 And we will hereafter refute more carefully, when we shall begin
to reply to all the sects, which, while they dispute,1636 have destroyed the truth.</p>

<p>But now we will argue against those who, falling from the second step, entertain wrong
sentiments respecting the Supreme God. For some say that He neither does a kindness to
any one, nor becomes angry, but in security and quietness enjoys the advantages of His own
immortality. Others, indeed, take away anger, but leave to God kindness; for they think that
a nature excelling in the greatest virtue, while it ought not to be malevolent, ought also to
be benevolent. Thus all the philosophers are agreed on the subject of anger, but are at variance
respecting kindness. But, that my speech may descend in order to the proposed subject, a
division of this kind must be made and followed by me, since anger and kindness are different,
and opposed to one another. Either anger must be attributed to God, and kindness
taken from Him; or both alike must be taken from Him; or anger must be taken away, and
kindness attributed to Him; or neither must be taken away. The nature of the case admits
of nothing else besides these; so that the truth, which is sought for, must necessarily be found
in some one of these. Let us consider them separately, that reason and arrangement may
conduct us to the hiding-place of truth.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="595"/>
<head>CHAP. III.—OF THE GOOD AND EVIL THINGS IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, AND OF
THEIR AUTHOR.</head>
<p>First, no one ever said this respecting God, that He is only subject to anger, and is not
influenced by kindness. For it is unsuitable to God, that He should be endowed with a power
of this kind, by which He may injure and do harm, but be unable to profit and to do good.
What means, therefore, what hope of safety, is proposed to men, if God is the author of evils
only? For if this is so, that venerable majesty will now be drawn out, not to the power of the
judge, to whom it is permitted to preserve and set at liberty, but to the office of the torturer
and executioner. But whereas we see that there are not only evils in human affairs, but also
goods, it is plain that if God is the author of evils, there must be another who does things
contrary to God, and gives to us good things. If there is such a one, by what name must he
be called? Why is he who injures us more known to us than He who benefits us? But if this
can be nothing besides God, it is absurd and vain to suppose that the divine power, than
which nothing is greater or better, is able to injure, but unable to benefit; and accordingly
no one has ever existed who ventured to assert this, because it is neither reasonable nor in
any way credible. And because this is agreed upon, let us pass on and seek after the truth
elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="596"/>
<head>CHAP. IV.—OF GOD AND HIS AFFECTIONS, AND THE CENSURE OF EPICURUS.</head>
<p>That which follows is concerning the school of Epicurus; that as there is no anger in
God, so indeed there is no kindness. For when Epicurus thought that it was inconsistent
with God to injure and to inflict harm, which for the most part arises from the affection of
anger, he took away from Him beneficence also, since he saw that it followed that if God
has anger, He must also have kindness. Therefore, lest he should concede to Him a vice, he
deprived Him also of virtue.1637 From this, he says, He is happy and uncorrupted, because
He cares about nothing, and neither takes trouble Himself nor occasions it to another.
Therefore He is not God, if He is neither moved, which is peculiar to a living being, nor
does anything impossible for man, which is peculiar to God, if He has no will at all, no action,
in short, no administration, which is worthy of God. And what greater, what more worthy
administration can be attributed to God, than the government of the world, and especially
of the human race, to which all earthly things are subject?</p>
<p>What happiness, then, can there be in God, if He is always inactive, being at rest and
unmoveable? if He is deaf to those who pray to Him, and blind to His worshippers? What
is so worthy of God, and so befitting to Him, as providence? But if He cares for nothing,
and foresees nothing, He has lost all His divinity. What else does he say, who takes from
God all power and all substance, except that there is no God at all? In short, Marcus Tullius
relates that it was said by Posidonius,1638 that Epicurus understood that there were no gods,
but that he said those things which he spoke respecting the gods for the sake of driving away
odium; and so that he leaves the gods in words, but takes them away in reality, since he gives
them no motion, no office. But if this is so, what can be more deceitful than him? And this
ought to be foreign to the character of a wise and weighty man. But if he understood one
thing and spoke another, what else is he to be called than a deceiver, double-tongued, wicked,
and moreover foolish? But Epicurus was not so crafty as to say those things with the desire
of deceiving, when he consigned these things also by his writings to everlasting remembrance;
but he erred through ignorance of the truth. For, being led from the beginning by the
probability1639 of a single opinion, he necessarily fell into those things which followed. For
the first opinion was, that anger was not consistent with the character of God. And when
this appeared to him to be true and unassailable,1640 he was unable to refuse the consequences;
because one affection being removed, necessity itself compelled him to remove
from God the other affections also. Thus, he who is not subject to anger is plainly uninfluenced
by kindness, which is the opposite feeling to anger. Now, if there is neither anger nor

kindness in Him, it is manifest that there is neither fear, nor joy, nor grief, nor pity. For all
the affections have one system, one motion,1641 which cannot be the case with God. But if
there is no affection in God, because whatever is subject to affections is weak, it follows that
there is in Him neither the care of anything, nor providence.</p>
<p>The disputation of the wise man1642 extends thus far: he was silent as to the other things
which follow; namely, that because there is in Him neither care nor providence, therefore
there is no reflection nor any perception in Him, by which it is effected that He has no existence
at all. Thus, when he had gradually descended, he remained on the last step, because
he now saw the precipice. But what does it avail to have remained silent, and concealed the
danger? Necessity compelled him even against his will to fall. For he said that which he did
not mean, because he so arranged his argument that he necessarily came to that point which
he wished to avoid. You see, therefore, to what point he comes, when anger is removed and
taken away from God. In short, either no one believes that, or a very few, and they the guilty
and the wicked, who hope for impunity for their sins. But if this also is found to be false,
that there is neither anger nor kindness in God, let us come to that which is put in the third
place.</p>

<head>CHAP. V.—THE OPINION OF THE STOICS CONCERNING GOD; OF HIS ANGER
AND KINDNESS.</head>
<p>The Stoics and some others are supposed to have entertained much better sentiments
respecting the divine nature, who say that there is kindness in God, but not anger. A very
pleasing and popular speech, that God is not subject to such littleness of mind as to imagine
that He is injured by any one, since it is impossible for Him to be injured; so that that serene
and holy majesty is excited, disturbed, and maddened, which is the part of human frailty.
For they say that anger is a commotion and perturbation of the mind, which is inconsistent
with God. Since, when it falls upon the mind of any one, as a violent tempest it excites such
waves that it changes the condition of the mind, the eyes gleam, the countenance trembles,
the tongue stammers, the teeth chatter, the countenance is alternately stained now with
redness spread over it, now with white paleness. But if anger is unbecoming to a man,
provided he be of wisdom and authority, how much more is so foul a change unbecoming
to God! And if man, when he has authority and power, inflicts widespread injury through
anger, sheds blood, overthrows cities, destroys communities, reduces provinces to desolation,
how much more is it to be believed that God, since He has power over the whole human
race, and over the universe itself, would have been about to destroy all things if He were
angry.</p>
<p>Therefore they think that so great and so pernicious an evil ought to be absent from
Him. And if anger and excitement are absent from Him, because it is disfiguring and injurious,
and He inflicts injury on no one, they think that nothing else remains, except that He
is mild, calm, propitious, beneficent, the preserver. For thus at length He may be called the
common Father of all, and the best and greatest, which His divine and heavenly nature demands.
For if among men it appears praiseworthy to do good rather than to injure, to restore
to life1643 rather than to kill, to save rather than to destroy, and innocence is not undeservedly
numbered among the virtues,—and he who does these things is loved, esteemed, honoured,
and celebrated with all blessings and vows,—in short, on account of his deserts and benefits
is judged to be most like to God; how much more right is it that God Himself, who excels
in divine and perfect virtues, and who is removed from all earthly taint, should conciliate1644
the whole race of man by divine and heavenly benefits! Those things are spoken speciously
and in a popular manner, and they allure many to believe them; but they who entertain
these sentiments approach nearer indeed to the truth, but they partly fail, not sufficiently
considering the nature of the case. For if God is not angry with the impious and the unrighteous,
it is clear that He does not love the pious and the righteous. Therefore the error of
those is more consistent who take away at once both anger and kindness. For in opposite
<note type="footnote">1643 Vivificare.</note>
<note type="footnote">1644 Promereri.</note>

<pb n="599"/>
matters it is necessary to be moved to both sides or to neither. Thus, he who loves the good
also hates the wicked, and he who does not hate the wicked does not love the good; because
the loving of the good arises from the hatred of the wicked, and the hating of the wicked
has its rise from the love of the good. There is no one who loves life without a hatred of
death, nor who is desirous of light, but he who avoids darkness. These things are so connected
by nature, that the one cannot exist without the other.</p>
<p>If any master has in his household a good and a bad servant, it is evident that he does
not hate them both, or confer upon both benefits and honours; for if he does this, he is both
unjust and foolish. But he addresses the one who is good with friendly words, and honours
him and sets him over his house and household, and all his affairs; but punishes the bad
one with reproaches, with stripes, with nakedness, with hunger, with thirst, with fetters: so
that the latter may be an example to others to keep them from sinning, and the former to
conciliate them; so that fear may restrain some, and honour may excite others. He, therefore,
who loves also hates, and he who hates also loves; for there are those who ought to be loved,
and there are those who ought to be hated. And as he who loves confers good things on
those whom he loves, so he who hates inflicts evils upon those whom he hates; which argument,
because it is true, can in no way be refuted. Therefore the opinion of those is vain and
false, who, when they attribute the one to God, take away the other, not less than the opinion
of those who take away both. But the latter, 1645 as we have shown, in part do not err, but
retain that which is the better of the two; whereas the former, 1646 led on by the accurate
method of their reasoning, fall into the greatest error, because they have assumed premises
which are altogether false. For they ought not to have reasoned thus: Because God is not liable
to anger, therefore He is not moved by kindness; but in this manner: Because God is moved
by kindness, therefore He is also liable to anger. For if it had been certain and undoubted
that God is not liable to anger, then the other point would necessarily be arrived at. But
since the question as to whether God is angry is more open to doubt, while it is almost perfectly
plain that He is kind, it is absurd to wish to subvert that which is certain by means of
an uncertainty, since it is easier to confirm uncertain things by means of those which are
certain.</p>

<p>These are the opinions entertained by the philosophers respecting God. But if we have
discovered that these things which have been spoken are false, there remains that one last
resource, in which alone the truth can be found, which has never been embraced by philosophers,
nor at any time defended: that it follows that God is angry, since He is moved by
kindness. This opinion is to be maintained and asserted by us; for1647 this is the sum and
turning-point on which the whole of piety and religion depend: and no honour can be due
to God, if He affords nothing to His worshippers; and no fear, if He is not angry with him
who does not worship Him.1648</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF MAN, AND THE BRUTE ANIMALS, AND RELIGION.</head>
<p>Though philosophers have often turned aside from reason through their ignorance of
the truth, and have fallen into inextricable errors (for that is wont to happen to these which
happens to a traveller ignorant of the way, and not confessing that he is ignorant ,—namely,
that he wanders about, while he is ashamed to inquire from those whom he meets), no
philosopher, however, has ever made the assertion that there is no difference between man
and the brutes. Nor has any one at all, provided that he wished to appear wise, reduced a
rational animal to the level of the mute and irrational; which some ignorant persons do,
resembling the brutes themselves, who, wishing to give themselves up to the indulgence of
their appetite and pleasure, say that they are born on the same principle as all living animals,
which it is impious for man to say. For who is so unlearned as not to know, who is so void
of understanding as not to perceive, that there is something divine in man? I do not as yet
come to the excellences of the soul and of the intellect, by which there is a manifest affinity
between man and God. Does not the position of the body itself, and the fashion of the
countenance, declare that we are not on a level with the dumb creation? Their nature is
prostrated to the ground and to their pasture, and has nothing in common with the heaven,
which they do not look upon. But man, with his erect position, with his elevated countenance
raised to the contemplation of the universe, compares his features with God, and reason
recognises reason.1649</p>
<p>And on this account there is no animal, as Cicero says,1650 except man, which has any
knowledge of God. For he alone is furnished with wisdom, so that he alone understands
religion; and this is the chief or only difference between man and the dumb animals. For
the other things which appear to be peculiar to man, even if there are not such in the dumb
animals, nevertheless may appear to be similar. Speech is peculiar to man; yet even in these
there is a certain resemblance to speech. For they both distinguish one another by their
voices; and when they are angry, they send forth a sound resembling altercation; and when
they see one another after an interval of time, they show the office of congratulation by their
voice. To us, indeed, their voices appear uncouth,1651 as ours perhaps do to them; but to
themselves, who understand one another, they are words. In short, in every affection they
utter distinct expressions of voice1652 by which they may show their state of mind. Laughter
also is peculiar to man; and yet we see certain indications of joy in other animals, when they
<note type="footnote">1649 The reason of man, man’s rational nature, recognizes the divine reason, i.e., God. [Confert cum Deo

use passionate gestures1653 with a view to sports, hang down1654 their ears, contract their
mouth, smooth their forehead, relax their eyes to sportiveness. What is so peculiar to man
as reason and the foreseeing of the future? But there are animals which open several outlets
in different directions from their lairs, that if any danger comes upon them, an escape may
be open for them shut in; but they would not do this unless they possessed intelligence and
reflection. Others are provident for the future, as
<lg>
<l>“Ants, when they plunder a great heap of corn, mindfulof the winter, and lay it
up in their dwelling;”1655</l>
</lg>
again,—
<lg>
<l>“As bees, which alone know a country and fixed abodes;
and mindful of the
winter which is to come, they practice labour in the
summer, and lay
up their gains as a common stock.”1656</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>It would be a long task if I should wish to trace out the things most resembling the skill
of man, which are accustomed to be done by the separate tribes of animals. But if, in the
case of all these things which are wont to be ascribed to man, there is found to be some resemblance
even in the dumb animals, it is evident that religion is the only thing of which
no trace can be found in the dumb animals, nor any indication. For justice is peculiar to
religion, and to this no other animal attains. For man alone bears rule; the other animals
are subjected1657 to him. But the worship of God is ascribed to justice; and he who does not
embrace this, being far removed from the nature of man, will live the life of the brutes under
the form of man. But since we differ from the other animals almost in this respect alone,
that we alone of all perceive the divine might and power, while in the others there is no
understanding of God, it is surely impossible that in this respect either the dumb animals
should have more wisdom, or human nature should be unwise, since all living creatures,
and the whole system of nature, are subject to man on account of his wisdom. Wherefore
if reason, if the force of man in this respect, excels and surpasses the rest of living creatures,
inasmuch as he alone is capable of the knowledge of God, it is evident that religion can in
no way be overthrown.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF RELIGION.</head>
<p>But religion is overthrown if we believe Epicurus speaking thus:—
<lg>
<l>“For the nature of gods must ever in itself of
necessity enjoy immortality together
with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn from our concerns;
since, exempt from every pain, exempt from all
dangers, strong in its
own resources, not wanting aught of us, it is neither
gained by favours
nor moved by anger.”1658</l>
</lg>
Now, when he says these things, does he think that any worship is to be paid to God, or does
he entirely overthrow religion? For if God confers nothing good on any one, if He repays
the obedience of His worshipper with no favour, what is so senseless, what so foolish, as to
build temples, to offer sacrifices, to present gifts, to diminish our property, that we may
obtain nothing?1659 But (it will be said) it is right that an excellent nature should be honoured.
What honour can be due to a being who pays no regard to us, and is ungrateful? Can we be
bound in any manner to him who has nothing in common with us? “Farewell to God,” says
Cicero,1660 “if He is such as to be influenced by no favour, and by no affection of men. For
why should I say ’may He be propitious? ’ for He can be propitious to no one.” What can
be spoken more contemptible with respect to God? Farewell to Him, he says, that is, let Him
depart and retire, since He is able to profit no one. But if God takes no trouble, nor occasions
trouble to another, why then should we not commit crimes as often as it shall be in our
power to escape the notice of men1661 and to cheat the public laws? Wherever we shall obtain
a favourable opportunity of escaping notice, let us take advantage of the occasion: let us
take away the property of others, either without bloodshed or even with blood, if there is
nothing else besides the laws to be reverenced.</p>
<p>While Epicurus entertains these sentiments, he altogether destroys religion; and when
this is taken away, confusion and perturbation of life will follow. But if religion cannot be
taken away without destroying our hold of wisdom, by which we are separated from the
brutes, and of justice, by which the public life may be more secure, how can religion itself
be maintained or guarded without fear? For that which is not feared is despised, and that
which is despised is plainly not reverenced. Thus it comes to pass that religion, and majesty,
and honour exist together with fear; but there is no fear where no one is angry. Whether,
therefore, you take away from God kindness, or anger, or both, religion must be taken away,
without which the life of men is full of folly, of wickedness, and enormity. For conscience

greatly curbs men, if we believe that we are living in the sight of God; if we imagine not only
that the actions which we perform are seen from above, but also that our thoughts and our
words are heard by God. But it is profitable to believe this, as some imagine, not for the sake
of the truth, but of utility, since laws cannot punish conscience unless some terror from
above hangs over to restrain offences. Therefore religion is altogether false, and there is no
divinity; but all things are made up by skilful men, in order that they may live more uprightly
and innocently. This is a great question, and foreign to the subject which we have proposed;
but because it necessarily occurs, it ought to be handled, however briefly.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD, AND OF OPINIONS OPPOSED TO
IT.</head>
<p>When the philosophers of former times had agreed in their opinions respecting
providence, and there was no doubt but that the world was set in order by God and reason,
and was governed by reason, Protagoras, in the times of Socrates, was the first of all who
said that it was not clear to him whether there was any divinity or not. And this disputation
of his was judged so impious, and so contrary to the truth and to religion, that the Athenians
both banished him from their territories, and burnt in a public assembly those books of his
in which these statements were contained. But there is no need to speak respecting his
opinions, because he pronounced nothing certain. After these things Socrates and his disciple
Plato, and those who flowed forth from the school of Plato like rivulets into different directions,
namely, the Stoics and Peripatetics, were of the same opinion as those who went before
them.1662</p>
<p>Afterwards Epicurus said that there was indeed a God, because it was necessary that
there should be in the world some being of surpassing excellence, distinction, and blessedness;
yet that there was no providence, and thus that the world itself was ordered by no plan, nor
art, nor workmanship, but that the universe was made up of certain minute and indivisible
seeds. But I do not see what can be said more repugnant to the truth. For if there is a God,
as God He is manifestly provident; nor can divinity be attributed to Him in any other way
than if He retains the past, and knows the present, and foresees the future. Therefore, in
taking away providence, he also denied the existence of God. But when he openly acknowledged
the existence of God, at the same time he also admitted His providence for the one
cannot exist at all, or be understood, without the other. But in those later times in which
philosophy had now lost its vigour 1663 there lived a certain Diagoras of Melos,1664 who
altogether denied the existence of God, and on account of this sentiment was called atheist;
1665 also Theodorus1666 of Cyrene: both of whom, because they were unable to discover
anything new, all things having already been said and found out, preferred even, in opposition
to the truth, to deny that in which all preceding philosophers had agreed without any ambiguity.
These are they who attacked providence, which had been asserted and defended
through so many ages by so many intellects. What then? Shall we refute those trifling and
inactive philosophers by reason, or by the authority of distinguished men, or rather by both?
But we must hasten onwards, lest our speech should wander too far from our subject.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD, AND THE NATURE OF AFFAIRS,
AND THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD.</head>
<p>They who do not admit that the world was made by divine providence, either say that
it is composed of first principles coming together at random, or that it suddenly came into
existence by nature, but hold, as Straton1667 does, that nature has in itself the power of
production and of diminution, but that it has neither sensibility nor figure, so that we may
understand that all things were produced spontaneously, without any artificer or author.
Each opinion is vain and impossible. But this happens to those who are ignorant of the
truth, that they devise anything, rather than perceive that which the nature of the subject1668
requires. First of all, with respect to those minute seeds, by the meeting together of which
they say that the whole world came into existence,1669 I ask where or whence they are. Who
has seen them at any time? Who has perceived them? Who has heard them? Had none but
Leucippus1670 eyes? Had he alone a mind, who assuredly alone of all men was blind and
senseless, since he spoke those things which no sick man could have uttered in his ravings,1671
or one asleep in his dreams?</p>
<p>The ancient philosophers argued that all things were made up of four elements.1672 He
would not admit this, lest he should appear to tread in the footsteps of others; but he held
that there were other first principles of the elements themselves, which can neither be seen,
nor touched, nor be perceived by any part of the body. They are so minute, he says, that
there is no edge of a sword so fine that they can be cut and divided by it. From which circumstance
he gave them the name of atoms. But it occurred to him, that if they all had one
and the same nature, they could not make up different objects of so great a variety as we see
to be present in the world. He said, therefore, that there were smooth and rough ones, and
round, and angular, and hooked. How much better had it been to be silent, than to have a
tongue for such miserable and empty uses! And, indeed, I fear lest he who thinks these
things worthy of refutation, should appear no less to rave. Let us, however, reply as to one
who says something.1673 If they are soft1674 and round, it is plain that they cannot lay hold
of one another, so as to make some body; as, though any one should wish to bind together
millet into one combination,1675 the very softness of the grains would not permit them to

come together into a mass. If they are rough, and angular, and hooked, so that they may be
able to cohere, then they are divisible, and capable of being cut; for hooks and angles must
project,1676 so that they may possibly be cut off.</p>
<p>Therefore that which is able to be cut off and torn away, will be able both to be seen and
held. “These,” he says, “flutter about with restless motions through empty space, and are
carried hither and thither, just as we see little particles of dust in the sun when it has introduced
its rays and light through a window. From these there arise trees and herbs, and all
fruits of the earth; from these, animals, and water, and fire, and all things are produced, and
are again resolved into the same elements.” This can be borne as long as the inquiry is respecting
small matters. Even the world itself was made up of these. He has reached to the
full extent of perfect madness: it seems impossible that anything further should be said, and
yet he found something to add. “Since everything,” he says, “is infinite, and nothing can be
empty, it follows of necessity that there are innumerable worlds.” What force of atoms had
been so great, that masses so incalculable should be collected from such minute elements?
And first of all I ask, What is the nature or origin of those seeds? For if all things are from
them, whence shall we say that they themselves are? What nature supplied such an abundance
of matter for the making of innumerable worlds? But let us grant that he raved with impunity
concerning worlds; let us speak respecting this in which we are, and which we see. He says
that all things are made from minute bodies which are incapable of division.</p>
<p>If this were so, no object would ever need the seed of its own kind. Birds would be born
without eggs, or eggs without bringing forth; likewise the rest of the living creatures without
coition: trees and the productions of the earth would not have their own seeds, which we
daily handle and sow. Why does a corn-field arise from grain, and again grain from a corn-
field? In short, if the meeting together and collecting of atoms would effect all things, all
things would grow together in the air, since atoms flutter about through empty space. Why
cannot the herb, why cannot the tree or grain, arise or be increased without earth, without
roots, without moisture, without seed? From which it is evident that nothing is made up
from atoms, since everything has its own peculiar and fixed nature, its own seed, its own
law given from the beginning. Finally, Lucretius, as though forgetful of atoms,1677 which
he was maintaining, in order that he might refute those who say that all things are produced
from nothing, employed these arguments, which might have weighed against himself. For
he thus spoke:—
<lg>
<l>“If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of
anything; nothing
would require seed.”1678</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">1676 Eminere, “to stand out prominently.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1677 [Vol. vi. p. 445, note 18.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1678 Lucret., i. 160.</note>

<pb n="608"/>
Likewise afterwards:—
<lg>
<l>“We must admit, therefore, that nothing can come from
nothing, since things
require seed before they can severally be born, and be
brought out into
the buxom fields of air.”1679</l>
</lg>
Who would imagine that he had brain when he said these things, and did not see that they
were contrary to one another? For that nothing is made by means of atoms, is apparent
from this, that everything has a definite1680 seed, unless by chance we shall believe that the
nature both of fire and water is derived from atoms. Why should I say, that if materials of
the greatest hardness are struck together with a violent blow, fire is struck out? Are atoms
concealed in the steel, or in the flint? Who shut them in? Or why do they not leap forth
spontaneously? Or how could the seeds of fire remain in a material of the greatest coldness?</p>
<p>I leave the subject of the flint and steel. If you hold in the sun an orb of crystal filled
with water, fire is kindled from the light which is reflected from the water, even in the most
severe cold. Must we then believe that fire is contained in the water? And yet fire cannot be
kindled from the sun even in summer. If you shall breathe upon wax, or if a light vapour
shall touch anything—either the hard surface1681 of marble or a plate of metal—water is
gradually condensed by means of the most minute drops. Also from the exhalation of the
earth or sea mist is formed, which either, being dispersed, moistens whatever it has covered,
or being collected, is carried aloft by the wind to high mountains, and compressed into
cloud, and sends down great rains. Where, then, do we say that fluids are produced? Is it in
the vapour? Or in the exhalation? Or in the wind? But nothing can be formed in that which
is neither touched nor seen. Why should I speak of animals, in whose bodies we see nothing
formed without plan, without arrangement, without utility, without beauty, so that the most
skilful and careful marking out1682 of all the parts and members repels the idea of accident
and chance? But let us suppose it possible that the limbs, and bones, and nerves, and blood
should be made up of atoms. What of the senses, the reflection, the memory, the mind, the
natural capacity: from what seeds can they be compacted? 1683 He says, From the most
minute. There are therefore others of greater size. How, then, are they indivisible?</p>
<p>In the next place, if the things which are not seen are formed from invisible seeds, it
follows that those which are seen are from visible seeds. Why, then, does no one see them?

But whether any one regards the invisible parts which are in man, or the parts which can
be touched, and which are visible, who does not see that both parts exist in accordance with
design? 1684 How, then, can bodies which meet together without design effect anything
reasonable? 1685 For we see that there is nothing in the whole world which has not in itself
very great and wonderful design. And since this is above the sense and capacity of man, to
what can it be more rightly attributed than to the divine providence? If a statue, the resemblance
of man, is made by the exercise of design and art, shall we suppose that man himself
is made up of fragments which come together at random? And what resemblance to the
truth is there in the thing produced, 1686 when the greatest and most surpassing skill1687
can imitate nothing more than the mere outline and extreme lineaments1688 of the body?
Was the skill of man able to give to his production any motion or sensibility? I say nothing
of the exercise of the sight, of hearing, and of smelling, and the wonderful uses of the other
members, either those which are in sight or those which are hidden from view. What artificer
could have fabricated either the heart of man, or the voice, or his very wisdom? Does any
man of sound mind, therefore, think that that which man cannot do by reason and judgment,
may be accomplished by a meeting together of atoms everywhere adhering to each other?
You see into what foolish ravings they have fallen, while they are unwilling to assign to God
the making and the care of all things</p>
<p>Let us, however, concede to them that the things which are earthly are made from atoms:
are the things also which are heavenly? They say that the gods are without contamination,
eternal, and blessed; and they grant to them alone an exemption, so that they do not appear
to be made up of a meeting together of atoms. For if the gods also had been made up of
these, they would be liable to be dispersed, the seeds at length being resolved, and returning
to their own nature. Therefore, if there is something which the atoms could not produce,
why may we not judge in the same way of the others? But I ask why the gods did not build
for themselves a dwelling-place before those first elements produced the world? It is manifest
that, unless the atoms had come together and made the heaven, the gods would still be suspended
through the midst of empty space. By what counsel, then, by what plan, did the
atoms from a confused mass collect themselves, so that from some the earth below was
formed into a globe, and the heaven stretched out above, adorned with so great a variety of
constellations that nothing can be conceived more embellished? Can he, therefore, who sees
such and so great objects, imagine that they were made without any design, without any

providence, without any divine intelligence, but that such great and wonderful things arose
out of fine and minute atoms? Does it not resemble a prodigy, that there should be any human
being who might say these things, or that there should be those who might believe them—as
Democritus, who was his hearer, or Epicurus, to whom all folly flowed forth from the
fountain of Leucippus? But, as others say, the world was made by Nature, which is without
perception and figure.1689 But this is much more absurd. If Nature made the world, it must
have made it by judgment and intelligence; for it is he that makes something who has either
the inclination to make it, or knowledge. If nature is without perception and figure, how
can that be made by it which has both perception and figure, unless by chance any one
thinks that the fabric of animals, which is so delicate, could have been formed and animated
by that which is without perception, or that that figure of heaven, which is prepared with
such foresight for the uses of living beings, suddenly came into existence by some accident
or other, without a builder, without an artificer? 1690</p>
<p>“If there is anything,” says Chrysippus, “which effects those things which man, though
he is endowed with reason, cannot do, that assuredly is greater, and stronger, and wiser
than man.” But man cannot make heavenly things; therefore that which shall produce or
has produced these things surpasses man in art, in design, in skill, and in power. Who,
therefore, can it be but God? But Nature, which they suppose to be, as it were, the mother
of all things, if it has not a mind, will effect nothing, will contrive nothing; for where there
is no reflection there is neither motion nor efficacy. But if it uses counsel for the commencement
of anything, reason for its arrangement, art for its accomplishment, energy for its
consummation, and power to govern and control, why should it be called Nature rather
than God? Or if a concourse of atoms, or Nature without mind, made those things which
we see, I ask why it was able to make the heaven, but unable to make a city or a house? 1691
Why it made mountains of marble, but did not make columns and statues? But ought not
atoms to have come together to effect these things, since they leave no position untried? For
concerning Nature, which has no mind, it is no wonder that it forgot to do these things.
What, then, is the case? It is plain that God, when He commenced this work of the
world,—than which nothing can be better arranged with respect to order, nor more befitting
as to utility, nor more adorned as to beauty, nor greater as to bulk,—Himself made the things
which could not be made by man; and among these also man himself, to whom He gave a
portion of His own wisdom, and furnished him with reason, as much as earthly frailty was
capable of receiving, that he might make for himself the things which were necessary for
his own uses.</p>

<p>But if in the commonwealth of this world, so to speak, there is no providence which
rules, no God who administers, no sense at all prevails in this nature of things. From what
source therefore will it be believed that the human mind, with its skill and its intelligence,
had its origin? For if the body of man was made from the ground, from which circumstance
man received his name;1692 it follows that the soul, which has intelligence, and is the ruler
of the body, which the limbs obey as a king and commander, which can neither be looked
upon nor comprehended, could not have come to man except from a wise nature. But as
mind and soul govern everybody, so also does God govern the world. For it is not probable
that lesser and humble things bear rule, but that greater and highest things do not bear rule.
In short, Marcus Cicero, in his Tusculan Disputations,1693 and in his Consolation, says: “No
origin of souls can be found on earth. For there is nothing, he says, mixed and compound1694
in souls, or which may appear to be produced and made up from the earth; nothing moist
or airy,1695 or of the nature of fire. For in these natures there is nothing which has the force
of memory, of mind and reflection, which both retains the past and foresees the future, and
is able to comprise the present; which things alone are divine. For no source will ever be
found from which they are able to come to man, unless it be from God.” Since, therefore,
with the exception of two or three vain calumniators, it is agreed upon that the world is
governed by providence, as also it was made, and there is no one who ventures to prefer the
opinion of Diagoras and Theodorus, or the empty fiction of Leucippus, or the levity of
Democritus and Epicurus, either to the authority of those seven ancient men who were
called wise,1696 or to that of Pythagoras or of Socrates or Plato, and the other philosophers
who judged that there is a providence; therefore that opinion also is false, by which they
think that religion was instituted by wise men for the sake of terror and fear, in order that
ignorant men might abstain from sins.</p>
<p>But if this is true, it follows that we are derided by the wise men of old. But if they invented
religion for the sake of deceiving us, and moreover of deceiving the whole human race,
therefore they were not wise, because falsehood is not consistent with the character of the
wise man. But grant that they were wise; what great success in falsehood was it, that they
were able to deceive not only the unlearned, but Plato also, and Socrates, and so easily to
delude Pythagoras, Zeno, and Aristotle, the chiefs of the greatest sects? There is therefore
a divine providence, as those men whom I have named perceived, by the energy and power
of which all things which we see were both made and are governed. For so vast a system of

things1697 such arrangement and such regularity in preserving the settled orders and times,
could neither at first have arisen without a provident artificer, or have existed so many ages
without a powerful inhabitant, or have been perpetually governed without a skilful and intelligent1698
ruler; and reason itself declares this. For whatever exists which has reason, must
have arisen from reason. Now reason is the part of an intelligent and wise nature; but a wise
and intelligent nature can be nothing else than God. Now the world, since it has reason, by
which it is both governed and kept together, was therefore made by God. But if God is the
maker and ruler of the world, then religion is rightly and truly established; for honour and
worship are due to the author and common parent of all things.</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF GOD, AND THAT THE ONE GOD, AND BY WHOSE PROVIDENCE
THE WORLD IS GOVERNED AND EXISTS.</head>
<p>Since it is agreed upon concerning providence, it follows that we show whether it is to
be believed that it belongs to many, or rather to one only. We have sufficiently taught, as I
think, in our Institutions, that there cannot be many gods; because, if the divine energy and
power be distributed among several, it must necessarily be diminished. But that which is
lessened is plainly mortal; but if He is not mortal, He can neither be lessened nor divided.
Therefore there is but one God, in whom complete energy and power can neither be lessened
nor increased. But if there are many, while they separately have something of power and
authority, the sum itself decreases; nor will they separately be able to have the whole, which
they have in common with others: so much will be wanting to each as the others shall possess.
There cannot therefore be many rulers in this world, nor many masters in one house, nor
many pilots in one ship, nor many leaders in one herd or flock, nor many queens in one
swarm. But there could not have been many suns in heaven, as there are not several souls
in one body; so entirely does the whole of nature agree in unity. But if the world
<lg>
<l>“Is nourished by a soul,</l>
<l>A spirit whose celestial flame</l>
<l>Glows in each member of the frame,</l>
<l>And stirs the mighty whole,”1699</l>
</lg>
it is evident from the testimony of the poet, that there is one God who inhabits the world,
since the whole body cannot be inhabited and governed except by one mind. Therefore all
divine power must be in one person, by whose will and command all things are ruled; and
therefore He is so great, that He cannot be described in words by man, or estimated by the
senses. From what source, therefore, did the opinion or persuasion1700 respecting many
gods come to men? Without doubt, all those who are worshipped as gods were men, and
were also the earliest and greatest kings; but who is ignorant that they were invested with
divine honours after death, either on account of the virtue by which they had profited the
race of men, or that they obtained immortal memory on account of the benefits and inventions
by which they had adorned human life? And not only men, but women also. And this,
both the most ancient writers of Greece, whom they call theologi;1701 and also Roman writers
<note type="footnote">1699 Virg., Æn., vi. 726.</note>

<pb n="614"/>
following and imitating the Greeks, teach; of whom especially Euhemerus and our Ennius,
who point out the birthdays, marriages, offspring, governments, exploits, deaths, and
tombs1702 of all of them. And Tullius, following them, in his third book, On the Nature of
the Gods, destroyed the public religions; but neither he himself nor any other person was
able to introduce the true one, of which he was ignorant. And thus he himself testified that
that which was false was evident; that the truth, however, lay concealed. “Would to heaven,”
he says, “that I could as easily discover true things as refute those that are false!”1703 And
this he proclaimed not with dissimulation as an Academic, but truly and in accordance with
the feeling of his mind, because the truth cannot be uprooted from human perceptions: that
which the foresight of man was able to attain to, he attained to, that he might expose false
things. For whatever is fictitious and false, because it is supported by no reason, is easily
destroyed. There is therefore one God, the source and origin of all things, as Plato both felt
and taught in the Timoeus, whose majesty he declares to be so great, that it can neither be
comprehended by the mind nor be expressed by the tongue.</p>
<p>Hermes bears the same testimony, whom Cicero asserts1704 to be reckoned by the
Egyptians among the number of the gods. I speak of him who, on account of his excellence
and knowledge of many arts, was called Trismegistus; and he was far more ancient not only
than Plato, but than Pythagoras, and those seven wise men.1705 In Xenophon,1706 Socrates,
as he discourses, says that “the form of God ought not to be inquired about: “and Plato, in
his Book of Laws,1707 says: “What God is, ought not to be the subject of inquiry, because it
can neither be found out nor related.” Pythagoras also admits that there is but one God,
saying that there is an incorporeal mind, which, being diffused and stretched through all
nature, gives vital perception to all living creatures; but Antisthenes, in his Physics, said that
there was but one natural God, although the nations and cities have gods of their own people.
Aristotle, with his followers the Peripatetics, and Zeno with his followers the Stoics, say
nearly the same things. Truly it would be a long task to follow up the opinions of all separately,
who, although they used different names, nevertheless agreed in one power which
governed the world. But, however, though philosophers and poets, and those, in short, who
worship the gods, often acknowledge the Supreme God, yet no one ever inquired into, no
one discussed, the subject of His worship and honours; with that persuasion, in truth, with
which, always believing Him to be bounteous and incorruptible, they think1708 that He is

<head>CHAP. XII.—OF RELIGION AND THE FEAR OF GOD.</head>
<p>Now, since we have replied to the impious and detestable wisdom,1710 or rather senselessness
of some, let us return to our proposed subject. We have said that, if religion is taken
away, neither wisdom nor justice can be retained: wisdom, because the understanding of
the divine nature, in which we differ from the brutes, is found in man alone; justice, because
unless God, who cannot be deceived, shall restrain our desires, we shall live wickedly and
impiously. Therefore, that our actions should be viewed by God, pertains not only to the
usefulness of common life, but even to the truth; because, if religion and justice are taken
away, having lost our reason, we either descend to the senselessness1711 of the herds; or to
the savageness of the beasts, yea, even more so, since the beasts spare animals of their own
kind. What will be more savage, what more unmerciful, than man, if, the fear of a superior
being taken away, he shall be able either to escape the notice of or to despise the might of
the laws? It is therefore the fear of God alone which guards the mutual society of men, by
which life itself is sustained, protected, and governed. But that fear is taken away if man is
persuaded that God is without anger; for that He is moved and indignant when unjust actions
are done, not only the common advantage, but even reason itself, and truth, persuade us.
We must again return to the former subjects, that, as we have taught that the world was
made by God, we may teach why it was made.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIII.—OF THE ADVANTAGE AND USE OF THE WORLD AND OF THE
SEASONS.</head>
<p>If any one considers the whole government of the world, he will certainly understand
how true is the opinion of the Stoics, who say that the world was made on our account. For
all the things of which the world is composed, and which it produces from itself, are adapted
to the use of man. Man, accordingly, uses fire for the purpose of warmth and light, and of
softening his food, and for the working of iron; he uses springs for drinking, and for baths;
he uses rivers for irrigating the fields, and assigning boundaries to countries; he uses the
earth for receiving a variety of fruits, the hills for planting vineyards, the mountains for the
use of trees and firewood,1712 the plains for crops of grain; he uses the sea not only for
commerce, and for receiving supplies from distant countries, but also for abundance of
every kind of fish. But if he makes use of these elements to which he is nearest, there is no
doubt that he uses the heaven also, since the offices even of heavenly things are regulated
for the fertility of the earth from which we live. The sun, with its ceaseless courses and unequal
intervals,1713 completes its annual circles, and either at his rising draws forth the day for
labour, or at his setting brings on the night for repose; and at one time by his departure
farther towards the south, at another time by his approach nearer towards the north, he
causes the vicissitudes of winter and summer, so that both by the moistures and frosts of
winter the earth becomes enriched for fruitfulness, and by the heats of summer either the
produce of grass1714 is hardened by maturity, or that which is in moist places, being seethed
and heated, becomes ripened. The moon also, which governs the time of night, regulates
her monthly courses by the alternate loss and recovery of light,1715 and by the brightness
of her shining illumines the nights obscure with gloomy darkness, so that journeys in the
summer heat, and expeditions, and works, may be performed without labour and inconvenience;

The other heavenly bodies also, either at their rising or setting, supply favourable times1717
by their fixed positions.1718 Moreover, they also afford guidance to ships, that they may not
wander through the boundless deep with uncertain course, since the pilot duly observing
them arrives at the harbour of the shore at which he aims.1719 Clouds are attracted by the
breath of the winds, that the fields of sown grain may be watered with showers, that the
vines may abound with produce, and the trees with fruits. And these things are exhibited
by a succession of changes throughout the year, that nothing may at any time be wanting
by which the life of men is sustained. But1720 (it is said) the same earth nourishes the other
living creatures, and by the produce of the same even the dumb animals are fed. Has not
God laboured also for the sake of the dumb animals? By no means; because they are void
of reason. On the contrary, we understand that even these themselves in the same manner
were made by God for the use of man, partly for food, partly for clothing, partly to assist
him in his work; so that it is manifest that the divine providence wished to furnish and adorn
the life of men with an abundance of objects and resources, and on this account He both
filled the air with birds, and the sea with fishes, and the earth with quadrupeds. But the
Academics, arguing against the Stoics, are accustomed to ask why, if God made all things
for the sake of men, many things are found even opposed, and hostile, and injurious to us,
as well in the sea as on the land. And the Stoics, without any regard to the truth, most foolishly
repelled this. For they say that there are many things among natural productions,1721 and
reckoned among animals, the utility of which hitherto1722 escapes notice, but that this is
discovered in process of the times, as necessity and use have already discovered many things
which were unknown in former ages. What utility, then, can be discovered in mice, in beetles,
in serpents, which are troublesome and pernicious to man? Is it that some medicine lies
concealed in them? If there is any, it will at some time be found out, namely, as a remedy
against evils, whereas they complain that it is altogether evil. They say that the viper, when
burnt and reduced to ashes, is a remedy for the bite of the same beast. How much better
had it been that it should not exist at all, than that a remedy should be required against it
drawn from itself?</p>
<p>They might then have answered with more conciseness and truth after this manner.

His workmanship, He breathed wisdom into him alone, so that he might bring all things
into subjection to his own authority and government, and make use of all the advantages
of the world. And yet He set before him both good and evil things, inasmuch as He gave to
him wisdom, the whole nature of which is employed in discerning things evil and good: for
no one can choose better things, and know what is good, unless he at the same time knows
to reject and avoid the things which are evil.1723 They are both mutually connected with
each other, so that, the one being taken away, the other must also be taken away. Therefore,
good and evil things being set before it, then at length wisdom discharges its office, and
desires the good for usefulness, but rejects the evil for safety. Therefore, as innumerable
good things have been given which it might enjoy, so also have evils, against which it might
guard. For if there is no evil, no danger—nothing, in short, which can injure man—all the
material of wisdom is taken away, and will be unnecessary for man. For if only good things
are placed in sight, what need is there of reflection, of understanding, of knowledge, of
reason? since, wherever he shall extend his hand, that is befitting and adapted to nature; so
that if any one should wish to place a most exquisite dinner before infants, who as yet have
no taste, it is plain that each will desire that to which either impulse, or hunger, or even accident,
shall attract them; and whatever they shall take, it will be useful and salutary to them.
What injury will it therefore be for them always to remain as they are, and always to be infants
and unacquainted with affairs? But if you add a mixture either of bitter things, or things
useless, or even poisonous, they are plainly deceived through their ignorance of good and
evil, unless wisdom is added to them, by which they may have the rejection of evil things
and the choice of good things.</p>
<p>You see, therefore, that we have greater need of wisdom on account of evils; and unless
these things had been proposed to us, we should not be a rational animal. But if this account
is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is
done away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able, and
is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing
and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is
able and unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither
willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing
and able, which alone is suitable to God, from what source then are evils? or why does He
not remove them? I know that many of the philosophers, who defend providence, are accustomed
to be disturbed by this argument, and are almost driven against their will to admit
that God takes no interest in anything, which Epicurus especially aims at; but having examined
the matter, we easily do away with this formidable argument. For God is able to do
whatever He wishes, and there is no weakness or envy in God. He is able, therefore, to take
<note type="footnote">1723 [I have heretofore noted the elements of a theodicy to be found in Lactantius.]</note>

<pb n="620"/>
away evils; but He does not wish to do so, and yet He is not on that account envious. For
on this account He does not take them away, because He at the same time gives wisdom, as
I have shown; and there is more of goodness and pleasure in wisdom than of annoyance in
evils. For wisdom causes us even to know God, and by that knowledge to attain to immortality,
which is the chief good. Therefore, unless we first know evil, we shall be unable to
know good. But Epicurus did not see this, nor did any other, that if evils are taken away,
wisdom is in like manner taken away; and that no traces of virtue remain in man, the nature
of which consists in enduring and overcoming the bitterness of evils. And thus, for the sake
of a slight gain1724 in the taking away of evils, we should be deprived of a good, which is
very great, and true, and peculiar to us. It is plain, therefore, that all things are proposed for
the sake of man, as well evils as also goods.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIV.—WHY GOD MADE MAN.</head>
<p>It follows that I show for what purpose God made man himself. As He contrived the
world for the sake of man, so He formed man himself on His own account, as it were a priest
of a divine temple, a spectator of His works and of heavenly objects. For he is the only being
who, since he is intelligent and capable of reason, is able to understand God, to admire His
works, and perceive His energy and power; for on this account he is furnished with judgment,
intelligence, and prudence. On this account he alone, beyond the other living creatures, has
been made with an upright body and attitude, so that he seems to have been raised up for
the contemplation of his Parent.1725 On this account he alone has received language, and
a tongue the interpreter of his thought, that he may be able to declare the majesty of his
Lord. Lastly, for this cause all things were placed under his control, that he himself might
be under the control of God, their Maker and Creator. If God, therefore, designed man to
be a worshipper of Himself, and on this account gave him so much honour, that he might
rule over all things; it is plainly most just that he should worship Him1726 who bestowed
upon him such great gifts, and love man, who is united with us in the participation of the
divine justice. For it is not right that a worshipper of God should he injured by a worshipper
of God. From which it is understood that man was made for the sake of religion and justice.
And of this matter Marcus Tullius is a witness in his books respecting the Laws, since he
thus speaks:1727 “But of all things concerning which learned men dispute, nothing is of
greater consequence than that it should be altogether understood that we are born to justice.”
And if this is most true, it follows that God will have all men to be just, that is, to have God
and man as objects of their affection; to honour God in truth as a Father, and to love man
as a brother: for in these two things the whole of justice is comprised. But he who either
fails to acknowledge God or acts injuriously to man, lives unjustly and contrary to his nature,
and in this manner disturbs the divine institution and law.</p>

<head>CHAP. XV.—WHENCE SINS EXTENDED TO MAN.</head>
<p>Here perhaps some one may ask, Whence sins extended to man, or what perversion
distorted the rule of the divine institution to worse things, so that, though he was born to
justice, he nevertheless performs unjust works. I have already in a former place explained,
that God at the same time set before him good and evil, and that He loves the good, and
hates the evil which is contrary to this; but that He permitted the evil on this account, that
the good also might shine forth, since, as I have often taught, we understand that the one
cannot exist without the other; in short, that the world itself is made up of two elements
opposing and connected with one another, of fire and moisture, and that light could not
have been made unless there has also been darkness, since there cannot be a higher place
without a lower, nor a rising without a setting, nor warmth without cold, nor softness without
hardness. Thus also we are composed of two substances equally opposed to one another—soul
and body: the one of which is assigned to the heaven, because it is slight and not to be
handled; the other to the earth, because it is capable of being laid hold of: the one is firm1728
and eternal, the other frail and mortal. Therefore good clings to the one, and evil to the
other: light, life, and justice to the one; darkness, death, and injustice to the other. Hence
there arose among men the corruption of their nature, so that it was necessary that a law
should be established, by which vices might be prohibited, and the duties of virtue be enjoined.
Since, therefore, there are good and evil things in the affairs of men, the nature of
which I have set forth, it must be that God is moved to both sides, both to favour when He
sees that just things are done, and to anger when He perceives unjust things.</p>
<p>But Epicurus opposes us, and says: “If there is in God the affection of joy leading Him
to favour, and of hatred influencing Him to anger, He must of necessity have both fear, and
inclination, and desire, and the other affections which belong to human weakness.” It does
not follow that he who is angry must fear, or that he who feels joy must grieve; in short, they
who are liable to anger are less timid, and they who are of a joyful temperament are less affected
with grief. What need is there to speak of the affections of humanity, to which our
nature yields? Let us weigh the divine necessity; for I am unwilling to speak of nature, since
it is believed that our God was never born. The affection of fear has a subject-matter in man,
but it has none in God. Man, inasmuch as he is liable to many accidents and dangers, fears
lest any greater violence should arise which may strike, despoil, lacerate, dash down, and
destroy him. But God, who is liable neither to want, nor injury, nor pain, nor death, can by
no means fear, because there is nothing which can offer violence to Him. Also the reason
and cause of desire is manifest in man. For, inasmuch as he was made frail and mortal, it
was necessary that another and different sex should be made, by union with which offspring
might be produced to continue the perpetuity of his race. But this desire has no place in
<note type="footnote">1728 Solidum.</note>

<pb n="623"/>
God, because frailty and death are far removed from Him; nor is there with Him any female
in whose union He is able to rejoice; nor does He stand in need of succession, since He will
live for ever. The same things may be said respecting envy and passion, to which, from sure
and manifest causes, man is liable, but to which God is by no means liable. But, in truth,
favour and anger and pity have their substance1729 in God, and that greatest and matchless
power employs them for the preservation of the world.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—OF GOD, AND HIS ANGER AND AFFECTIONS.</head>
<p>Some one will ask what this substance is. First of all, when evils befall them, men in
their dejected state for the most part have recourse to God: they appease and entreat Him,
believing that He is able to repel injuries from them. He has therefore an occasion of exercising
pity; for He is not so unmerciful and a despiser of men as to refuse aid to those who
are in distress. Very many, also, who are persuaded that justice is pleasing to God, both
worship Him who is Lord and Parent of all, and with continual prayers and repeated vows
offer gifts and sacrifices, follow up His name with praises, striving to gain His favour by just
and good works. There is therefore a reason, on account of which God may and ought to
favour them. For if there is nothing so befitting God as beneficence, and nothing so unsuited
to His character as to be ungrateful, it is necessary that He should make some return for the
services of those who are excellent, and who lead a holy life, that He may not be liable to
the charge of ingratitude which is worthy of blame1730 even in the case of a man. But, on
the contrary, others are daring1731 and wicked, who pollute all things with their lusts, harass
with slaughters, practice fraud, plunder, commit perjury, neither spare relatives nor parents,
neglect the laws, and even God Himself. Anger, therefore, has a befitting occasion1732 in
God.</p>
<p>For it is not right that, when He sees such things, He should not be moved, and arise to
take vengeance upon the wicked, and destroy the pestilent and guilty, so as to promote the
interests of all good men. Thus even in anger itself there is also contained a showing of
kindness.1733 Therefore the arguments are found to be empty and false, either of those who,
when they will not admit that God is angry, will have it that He shows kindness, because
this, indeed, cannot take place without anger; or of those who think that there is no emotion
of the mind in God. And because there are some affections to which God is not liable, as
desire, fear, avarice, grief, and envy, they have said that He is entirely free from all affection.
For He is not liable to these, because they are vicious affections; but as to those which belong
to virtue,—that is, anger towards the wicked, regard towards the good, pity towards the afflicted,—
inasmuch as they are worthy of the divine power, He has affections of His own,1734
both just and true. And if He is not possessed of them, the life of man will be thrown into
confusion, and the condition of things will come to such disturbance that the laws will be
despised and overpowered, and audacity alone reign, so that no one can at length be in
safety unless he who excels1735 in strength. Thus all the earth will be laid waste, as it were,

by a common robbery. But now, since the wicked expect punishment, and the good hope
for favour, and the afflicted look for aid, there is place for virtues, and crimes are more rare.
But1736 it is said, ofttimes the wicked are more prosperous, and the good more wretched,
and the just are harassed with impunity by the unjust. We will hereafter consider why these
things happen. In the meantime let us explain respecting anger, whether there be any in
God; whether He takes no notice at all, and is unmoved at those things which are done with
impiety.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF GOD, HIS CARE AND ANGER.</head>
<p>God, says Epicurus, regards nothing; therefore He has no power. For he who has power
must of necessity regard affairs. For if He has power, and does not use it, what so great cause
is there that, I will not say our race, but even the universe itself, should be contemptible in
His sight? On this account he says He is pure1737 and happy, because He is always at rest.1738
To whom, then, has the administration of so great affairs been entrusted,1739 if these things
which we see to be governed by the highest judgment are neglected by God? or how can he
who lives and perceives be at rest? For rest belongs either to sleep or to death. But sleep has
not rest. For when we are asleep, the body indeed is at rest, but the soul is restless and agitated:
it forms for itself images which it may behold, so that it exercises its natural power of motion
by a variety of visions, and calls itself away from false things, until the limbs are satiated,
and receive vigour from rest. Therefore eternal rest belongs to death alone. Now if death
does not affect God, it follows that God is never at rest. But in what can the action of God
consist, but in the administration of the world? But if God carries on the care of the world,
it follows that He cares for the life of men, and takes notice of the acts of individuals, and
He earnestly desires that they should be wise and good. This is the will of God, this the divine
law; and he who follows and observes this is beloved by God. It is necessary that He should
be moved with anger against the man who has broken or despised this eternal and divine
law. If, he says, God does harm to any one, therefore He is not good. They are deceived by
no slight error who defame all censure, whether human or divine, with the name of bitterness
and malice, thinking that He ought to be called injurious1740 who visits the injurious with
punishment. But if this is so, it follows that we have injurious laws, which enact punishment
for offenders, and injurious judges who inflict capital punishments on those convicted of
crime. But if the law is just which awards to the transgressor his due, and if the judge is
called upright and good when he punishes crimes,—for he guards the safety of good men
who punishes the evil,—it follows that God, when He opposes the evil, is not injurious; but
he himself is injurious who either injures an innocent man, or spares an injurious person
that he may injure many.</p>
<p>I would gladly ask from those who represent God as immoveable,1741 if any one had
property, a house, a household1742 of slaves, and his slaves, despising the forbearance of
their master, should attack all things, and themselves take the enjoyment of his goods, if his

<pb n="627"/>
household should honour them, while the master was despised by all, insulted, and deserted:
could he be a wise man who should not avenge the insults, but permit those over whom he
had power to have the enjoyment of his property? Can such forbearance be found in any
one? If, indeed, it is to be called forbearance, and not rather a kind of insensible stupor. But
it is easy to endure contempt. What if those things were done which are spoken of by
Cicero?1743 “For I ask, if any head of a family,1744 when his children had been put to death
by a slave, his wife slain and his house set on fire, should not exact most severe punishment
from that slave, whether he would appear to be kind and merciful, or inhuman and most
cruel? “But if to pardon deeds of this kind is the part of cruelty rather than of kindness,1745
it is not therefore the part of goodness in God not to be moved at those things which are
done unjustly. For the world is, as it were, the house of God, and men, as it were, His slaves;
and if His name is a mockery to them, what kind or amount of forbearance is it to give1746
up His own honours, to see wicked and unjust things done, and not to be indignant, which
is peculiar and natural to Him who is displeased with sins! To be angry, therefore, is the
part of reason: for thus faults are removed, and licentiousness is curbed; and this is plainly
in accordance with justice and wisdom.</p>
<p>But the Stoics did not see that there is a distinction between right and wrong, that there
is a just and also an unjust anger; and because they did not find a remedy for the matter,
they wished altogether to remove it. But the Peripatetics said that it was not to be cut out,
but moderated; to whom we have made a sufficient reply in the sixth book of the Institutions.
1747 Now, that the philosophers were ignorant of the nature of anger, is plain from
their definitions, which Seneca enumerated in the books which he composed on the subject
of anger. “Anger is,” he says, “the desire of avenging an injury.” Others, as Posidonius says,
describe it as the desire of punishing him by whom you think that you have been unfairly
injured. Some have thus defined it: “Anger is an incitement of the mind to injure him who
either has committed an injury, or who has wished to do so.” The definition of Aristotle
does not differ greatly from ours;1748 for he says that “anger is the desire of requiting pain.”
This is the unjust anger, concerning which we spoke before, which is contained even in the
dumb animals; but it is to be restrained in man, lest he should rush to some very great evil
through rage. This cannot exist in God, because He cannot be injured;1749 but it is found

<pb n="628"/>
in man, inasmuch as he is frail. For the inflicting1750 of injury inflames1751 anguish, and
anguish produces a desire of revenge. Where, then, is that just anger against offenders? For
this is evidently not the desire of revenge, inasmuch as no injury precedes. I do not speak
of those who sin against the laws; for although a judge may be angry with these without incurring
blame, let us, however, suppose that he ought to be of a sedate mind when he sentences
the guilty to punishment, because he is the executor1752 of the laws, not of his own
spirit or power; for so they wish it who endeavour to extirpate anger. But I speak of those
in particular who are in our own power, as slaves, children, wives, and pupils; for when we
see these offend, we are incited to restrain them.</p>
<p>For it cannot fail to be, that he who is just and good is displeased with things which are
bad, and that he who is displeased with evil is moved when he sees it practised. Therefore
we arise to take vengeance, not because we have been injured, but that discipline may be
preserved, morals may be corrected, and licentiousness be suppressed. This is just anger;
and as it is necessary in man for the correction of wickedness, so manifestly is it necessary
in God, from whom an example comes to man. For as we ought to restrain those who are
subject to our power, so also ought God to restrain the offences of all. And in order that He
may do this, He must be angry; because it is natural for one who is good to be moved and
incited at the fault of another. Therefore they ought to have given this definition: Anger is
an emotion of the mind arousing itself for the restraining of faults.1753 For the definition
given by Cicero, “Anger is the desire of taking vengeance,” does not differ much from those
already mentioned.1754 But that anger which we may call either fury or rage ought not to
exist even in man, because it is altogether vicious; but the anger which relates to the correction
of vices ought not to be taken away from man; nor can it be taken away from God, because
it is both serviceable for the affairs of men, and necessary.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF THE PUNISHMENT OF FAULTS, THAT IT CANNOT TAKE
PLACE WITHOUT ANGER.</head>
<p>What need is there, they say, of anger, since faults can be corrected without this affection?
But there is no one who can calmly see any one committing an offence. This may perhaps
be possible in him who presides over the laws, because the deed is not committed before
his eyes, but it is brought before him as a doubtful matter from another quarter. Nor can
any wickedness be so manifest, that there is no place for a defence; and therefore it is possible
that a judge may not be moved against him who may possibly be found to be innocent; and
when the detected crime shall have come to light, he now no longer uses his own opinion,
but that of the laws. It may be granted that he does that which he does without anger; for
he has that which he may follow. We, undoubtedly, when an offence is committed by our
household at home, whether we see or perceive it, must be indignant; for the very sight of
a sin is unbecoming. For he who is altogether unmoved either approves of faults, which is
more disgraceful and unjust, or avoids the trouble of reproving them, which a tranquil
spirit and a quiet mind despises and refuses, unless anger shall have aroused and incited it.
But when any one is moved, and yet through unseasonable leniency grants pardon more
frequently than is necessary, or at all times, he evidently both destroys the life of those whose
audacity he is fostering for greater crimes, and furnishes himself with a perpetual source of
annoyances. Therefore the restraining of one’s anger in the case of sins is faulty.</p>
<p>Archytas of Tarentum is praised, who, when he had found everything ruined1755 on
his estate, rebuking the fault of his bailiff, said, “Wretch, I would have beaten you to death
if I had not been angry.” They consider this to be a singular example of forbearance; but
influenced by authority, they do not see how foolishly he spoke and acted. For if (as Plato
says) no prudent man punishes because there is an offence, but to prevent the occurrence
of an offence, it is evident how evil an example this wise man put forth. For if slaves shall
perceive that their master uses violence when he is not angry, and abstains from violence1756
when he is angry, it is evident that they will not commit slight offences, lest they should be
beaten; but will commit the greatest offences, that they may arouse the anger of the perverse
man, and escape with impunity. But I should praise him if, when he was enraged, he had
given space to his anger, that the excitement of his mind might calm down through the interval
of time, and his chastisement might be confined within moderate limits. Therefore,
on account of the magnitude of the anger, punishment ought not to have been inflicted, but
to have been delayed, lest it should inflict1757 upon the offender pain greater than is just,
or occasion an outburst of fury in the punisher. But how, how is it equitable or wise, that
<note type="footnote">1755 Corrupta esse omnia.</note>
<note type="footnote">1756 Parcere.</note>
<note type="footnote">1757 Inureret, i.e., should burn in, or brand.</note>

<pb n="630"/>
any one should be punished on account of a slight offence, and should be unpunished on
account of a very great one? But if he had learned the nature and causes of things, he never
would have professed so unsuitable a forbearance, that a wicked slave should rejoice that
his master has been angry with him. For as God has furnished the human body with many
and various senses which are necessary for the use of life, so also He has assigned to the soul
various affections by which the course of life might be regulated; and as He has given desire
for the sake of producing offspring, so has He given anger for the sake of restraining faults.</p>
<p>But they who are ignorant of the ends of good and evil things, as they employ sensual
desire for the purposes of corruption and pleasure, in the same manner make use of anger
and passion for the inflicting of injury, while they are angry with those whom they regard
with hatred. Therefore they are angry even with those who commit no offence, even with
their equals, or even with their superiors. Hence they daily rush to monstrous1758 deeds;
hence tragedies often arise. Therefore Archytas would be deserving of praise, if, when he
had been enraged against any citizen or equal who injured him, he had curbed himself, and
by forbearance mitigated the impetuosity of his fury. This self-restraint is glorious, by which
any great evil which impends is restrained; but it is a fault not to check the faults of slaves
and children; for through their escaping without punishment they will proceed to greater
evil. In this case anger is not to be restrained; but even if it is in a state of inactivity,1759 it
must be aroused. But that which we say respecting man, we also say respecting God, who
made man like to Himself. I omit making mention of the figure of God, because the Stoics
say that God has no form, and another great subject will arise if we should wish to refute
them. I only speak respecting the soul. If it belongs1760 to God to reflect, to be wise, to understand,
to foresee. to excel, and of all animals man alone has these qualities, it follows that
he was made after the likeness of God; but on this account he goes on to vice, because, being
mingled with frailty derived from earth, he is unable to preserve pure and uncontaminated
that which he has received from God, unless he is imbued with the precepts of justice by
the same God.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE SOUL AND BODY, AND OF PROVIDENCE.</head>
<p>But since he is made up, as we have said, of two parts, soul and body, the virtues are
contained in the one, and vices in the other, and they mutually oppose each other. For the
good properties of the soul, which consist in restraining lusts, are contrary to the body; and
the good properties of the body, which consist in every kind of pleasure, are hostile to the
soul. But if the virtue of the soul shall have resisted the desires, and suppressed them, he
will be truly like to God. From which it is evident that the soul of man, which is capable of
divine virtue, is not mortal. But there is this distinction, that since virtue is attended with
bitterness, and the attraction of pleasure is sweet, great numbers are overcome and are drawn
aside to the pleasantness; but they who have given themselves up to the body and earthly
things are pressed to the earth, and are unable to attain to the favour of the divine bounty,
because they have polluted themselves with the defilements of vices. But they who, following
God, and in obedience to Him, have despised the desires of the body, and, preferring virtue
to pleasures, have preserved innocence and righteousness, these God recognises as like to
Himself.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, He has laid down a most holy law, and wishes all men to be innocent
and beneficent, is it possible that He should not be angry when He sees that His law is despised,
that virtue is rejected, and pleasure made the object of pursuit? But if He is the governor
of the world, as He might to be, He surely does not despise that which is even of the greatest
importance in the whole world. If He has foresight, as it is befitting that God should have,
it is plain that He consults the interests of the human race, in order that our life may be
more abundantly supplied, and better, and safer. If He is the Father and God of all, He is
undoubtedly delighted with the virtues of men, and provoked by their vices. Therefore He
loves the just, and hates the wicked. There is no need (one says) of hatred; for He once for
all has fixed a reward for the good, and punishment for the wicked. But if any one lives justly
and innocently, and at the same time neither worships God nor has any regard for Him, as
Aristides, and Timon,1761 and others of the philosophers, will he escape1762 with impunity,
because, though he has obeyed the law of God, he has nevertheless despised God Himself?
There is therefore something on account of which God may be angry with one rebelling
against Him, as it were, in reliance upon His integrity. If He can be angry with this man on
account of his pride, why not more so with the sinner, who has despised the law together
with the Lawgiver? The judge cannot pardon offences, because he is subject to the will of
another. But God can pardon, because He is Himself the arbitrator1763 and judge of His

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF OFFENCES, AND THE MERCY OF GOD.</head>
<p>If He is able to pardon, He is therefore able also to be angry. Why, then, some one will
say, does it often occur, that they who sin are prosperous, and they who live piously are
wretched? Because fugitives and disinherited1764 persons live without restraint, and they
who are under the discipline of a father or master live in a more strict and frugal manner.
For virtue is proved and fixed1765 by means of ills; vices by means of pleasure. Nor, however,
ought he who sins to hope for lasting impunity, because there is no lasting happiness.
<lg>
<l>“But, in truth, the last day is always to be looked
for by man and no one ought
to be called happy before his death and last funeral rites,”1766</l>
</lg>
as the not inelegant poet says. It is the end which proves happiness, and no one is able to
escape the judgment of God, either when alive or after death. For He has the power both to
cast down the living from on high, and to punish the dead with eternal torments. Nay, he
says, if God is angry, He ought to have inflicted vengeance at once, and to have punished
every one according to his desert. But (it is replied) if He had done this, no one would survive.
For there is no one who offends in no respect, and there are many things which excite to
the commission of sin—age, intemperance, want, opportunity, reward. To such an extent
is the frailty of the flesh with which we are clothed liable to sin, that unless God were indulgent
to this necessity, perhaps too few would live. On this account He is most patient, and
restrains His anger. For because there is in Him perfect virtue, it follows of necessity that
His patience also is perfect, which is itself also a virtue. How many men, from having been
sinners, have afterwards become righteous; from being injurious, have become good; from
being wicked, have become temperate! How many who were in early life base, and condemned
by the judgment of all, afterwards have turned out praiseworthy? But it is plain that
this could not happen if punishment followed every offence.</p>
<p>The public laws condemn those who are manifestly guilty; but there are great numbers
whose offences are concealed, great numbers who restrain the accuser either by entreaties
or by reward, great numbers who elude justice by favour or influence. But if the divine
censure should condemn all those who escape the punishment of men, there would be few
or even no men on the earth. In short, even that one reason for destroying the human race
might have been a just one, that men, despising the living God, pay divine honour to earthly
and frail images, as though they were of heaven, adoring works made by human hands. And
though God their Creator made them of elevated countenance and upright figure, and raised

them to the contemplation of the heaven and the knowledge of God, they have preferred,
like cattle, to bend themselves to the earth.1767 For he is low, and curved, and bent downward,
who, turning away from the sight of heaven and God his Father, worships things of the
earth, which he ought to have trodden upon, that is, things made and fashioned from earth.
Therefore, amidst such great impiety and such great sins of men, the forbearance of God
attains this object, that men, condemning the errors of their past life, correct themselves.
In short, there are many who are just and good; and these, having laid aside the worship of
earthly things, acknowledge the majesty of the one and only God. But though the forbearance
of God is very great and most useful; yet, although late, He punishes the guilty, and does
not suffer them to proceed further, when He sees that they are incorrigible.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXI.—OF THE ANGER OF GOD AND MAN.</head>
<p>There remains one question, and that the last. For some one will perhaps say, that God
is so far from being angry, that in His precepts He even forbids man to be angry. I might
say that the anger of man ought to be curbed, because he is often angry unjustly; and he has
immediate emotion, because he is only for a time.1768 Therefore, lest those things should
be done which the low, and those of moderate station, and great kings do in their anger, his
rage ought to have been moderated and suppressed, lest, being out of his mind,1769 he should
commit some inexpiable crime. But God is not angry for a short time,1770 because He is
eternal and of perfect virtue, and He is never angry unless deservedly. But, however, the
matter is not so; for if He should altogether prohibit anger, He Himself would have been in
some measure the censurer of His own workmanship, since He from the beginning had inserted
anger in the liver1771 of man, since it is believed that the cause of this emotion is
contained in the moisture of the gall. Therefore He does not altogether prohibit anger, because
that affection is necessarily given, but He forbids us to persevere in anger. For the
anger of mortals ought to be mortal; for if it is lasting, enmity is strengthened to lasting destruction.
Then, again, when He enjoined us to be angry, and yet not to sin,1772 it is plain
that He did not tear up anger by the roots, but restrained it, that in every correction we
might preserve moderation and justice. Therefore He who commands us to be angry is
manifestly Himself angry; He who enjoins us to be quickly appeased is manifestly Himself
easy to be appeased: for He has enjoined those things which are just and useful for the interests
of society.1773</p>
<p>But because I had said that the anger of God is not for a time1774 only, as is the case
with man, who becomes inflamed with an immediate1775 excitement, and on account of
his frailty is unable easily to govern himself, we ought to understand that because God is
eternal, His anger also remains to eternity; but, on the other hand, that because He is endued
with the greatest excellence, He controls His anger, and is not ruled by it, but that He regulates
it according to His will. And it is plain that this is not opposed to that which has just been
said. For if His anger had been altogether immortal, there would be no place after a fault

for satisfaction or kind feeling, though He Himself commands men to be reconciled before
the setting of the sun.1776 But the divine anger remains for ever against those who ever sin.
Therefore God is appeased not by incense or a victim, not by costly offerings, which things
are all corruptible, but by a reformation of the morals: and he who ceases to sin renders the
anger of God mortal. For this reason He does not immediately1777 punish every one who
is guilty, that man may have the opportunity of coming to a right mind,1778 and correcting
himself.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXII.—OF SINS, AND THE VERSES OF THE SIBYLS RESPECTING THEM
RECITED.</head>
<p>This is what I had to say, most beloved Donatus, respecting the anger of God, that you
might know how to refute those who represent God as being without emotions.1779 It only
remains that, after the practice of Cicero, I should use an epilogue by way of peroration. As
he did in the Tusculan Disputations,1780 when discoursing on the subject of death, so we in
this work ought to bring forward divine testimonies, which may be believed, to refute the
persuasion of those who, believing that God is without anger, destroy all religion, without
which, as we have shown, we are either equal to the brutes in savageness, or to the cattle in
foolishness; for it is in religion only—that is, in the knowledge of the Supreme God—that
wisdom consists. All the prophets, being filled with the Divine Spirit, speak nothing else
than of the favour of God towards the righteous, and His anger against the ungodly. And
their testimony is indeed sufficient for us; but because it is not believed by those who make
a display of wisdom by their hair and dress,1781 it was necessary to refute them by reason
and arguments. For they act so preposterously,1782 that human things give authority to divine
things, whereas divine things ought rather to give authority to human. But let us now leave
these things, lest we should produce no effect upon them, and the subject should be indefinitely
drawn out. Let us therefore seek those testimonies which they can either believe, or
at any rate not oppose.</p>
<p>Authors of great number and weight have made mention of the Sibyls; of the Greeks,
Aristo the Chian, and Apollodorus the Erythræan; of our writers, Varro and Fenestella. All
these relate that the Erythræan Sibyl was distinguished and noble beyond the rest.
Apollodorus, indeed, boasts of her as his own citizen and countrywoman. But Fenestella
also relates that ambassadors were sent by the senate to Erythræ, that the verses of this Sibyl
might be conveyed to Rome, and that the consuls Curio and Octavius might take care that
they should be placed in the Capitol, which had then been restored under the care of Quintus
Catulus. In her writings, verses of this kind are found respecting the Supreme God and
Maker of the world:—
<lg>
<l>“The incorruptible and eternal Maker who dwells in the heaven, holding forth
good to the good, a much greater reward, but stirring up anger and
rage against the evil and unjust.”</l>

<pb n="638"/>
Again, in another place, enumerating the deeds by which God is especially moved to anger,
she introduced these things:—
<lg>
<l>“Avoid unlawful services, and serve the living God. Abstain from adultery and
impurity; bring up a pure generation of children; do not kill: for the
Immortal will be angry with every one who may sin.”</l>
</lg>
Therefore He is angry with sinners.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXIII.—OF THE ANGER OF GOD AND THE PUNISHMENT OF SINS, AND
A RECITAL OF THE VERSES OF THE SIBYLS RESPECTING IT; AND, MOREOVER,
A REPROOF AND EXHORTATION.</head>
<p>But because it is related by most learned men that there have been many Sibyls, the
testimony of one may not be sufficient to confirm the truth, as we purpose to do. The
volumes, indeed, of the Cumæan Sibyl, in which are written the fates of the Romans are
kept secret; but the writings of all the others are, for the most part, not prohibited from being
in common use. And of these another, denouncing the anger of God against all nations on
account of the impiety of men, thus began:—
<lg>
<l>“Since great anger is coming upon a disobedient world, I disclose the commands
of God to the last age, prophesying to all men from city to city.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Another Sibyl also said, that the deluge was caused by the indignation of God against
the unrighteous in a former age, that the wickedness of the human race might be extinguished:—
<lg>
<l>“From the time when, the God of heaven being enraged against the cities themselves
and all men, a deluge having burst forth, the sea covered the
earth.”</l>
</lg>
In like manner she foretold a conflagration about to take place hereafter, in which the impiety
of men should again be destroyed:—
<lg>
<l>“ And at some time, God no longer soothing His anger, but increasing it, and
destroying the race of men, and laying waste the whole of it by fire.”</l>
</lg>
From which mention is thus made concerning Jupiter by Ovid:1783—
<lg>
<l>“He remembers also that it is fated that the time shall come in which the sea, the
earth, and the palace of heaven, being caught by fire, shall be burnt,
and the curiously wrought framework of the world1784 be in danger.”</l>
</lg>
And this must come to pass at the time when the honour and worship of the Supreme shall
have perished among men. The same Sibyl, however, testifying that He was appeased by
reformation1785 of conduct and self-improvement, added these things :—
<note type="footnote">1783 Metam., i. 256.</note>
<note type="footnote">1784 Moles operose laboret.</note>
<note type="footnote">1785 Poenitentiâ factorum.</note>

<pb n="640"/>
<lg>
<l>“But, ye mortals, in pity1786 turn yourselves now, and do not lead the great God
to every kind of anger.”</l>
</lg>
And also a little later:—
<lg>
<l>“He will not destroy, but will again restrain His anger, if you all practice valuable
piety in your minds.”</l>
</lg>
Then another Sibyl declares that the Father of heavenly and earthly things ought to be loved,
lest His indignation should arise, to the destruction of men:—
<lg>
<l>“Lest by chance the immortal God should be angry, and destroy the whole race
of men, their life and shameless race, it is befitting that we love the
wise, ever-living God the Father.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>From these things it is evident that the arguments of the philosophers are vain, who
imagine that God is without anger, and among His other praises reckon that which is most
useless, detracting from Him that which is most salutary for human affairs, by which majesty
itself exists. For this earthly kingdom and government, unless guarded by fear, is broken
down. Take away anger from a king, and he will not only cease to be obeyed, but he will
even be cast down headlong from his height. Yea, rather take away this affection from any
person of low degree, and who will not plunder him? Who will not deride him? Who will
not treat him with injury? Thus he will be able to have neither clothing, nor an abode, nor
food, since others will deprive him of whatever he has; much less can we suppose that the
majesty of the heavenly government can exist without anger and fear. The Milesian Apollo
being consulted concerning the religion of the Jews, inserted these things in his answer:—
<lg>
<l>“God, the King and Father of all, before whom the earth trembles, and the
heaven and sea, and whom the recesses of Tartarus and the demons
dread.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>If He is so mild, as the philosophers will have it, how is it that not only the demons and
ministers of such great power, but even the heaven and earth, and the whole system of the
universe, tremble at His presence? For if no one submits to the service of another except by
compulsion, it follows that all government exists by fear, and fear by anger. For if any one
is not aroused against one who is unwilling to obey, it will not be possible for him to be
compelled to obedience. Let any one consult his own feelings; he will at once understand
<note type="footnote">1786 ἐλέει. Others read, ὦ μέλευι “O wretched.”</note>

<pb n="641"/>
that no one can be subdued to the command of another without anger and chastisement.
Therefore, where there shall be no anger, there will be no authority. But God has authority;
therefore also He must have anger, in which authority consists. Therefore let no one, induced
by the empty prating1787 of the philosophers, train himself to the contempt of God, which
is the greatest impiety. We all are bound both to love Him, because He is our Father; and
to reverence Him, because He is our Lord: both to pay Him honour, because He is bounteous;
and to fear Him, because He is severe: each character in Him is worthy of reverence.1788
Who can preserve his piety, and yet fail to love the parent of his life? or who can with impunity
despise Him who, as ruler of all things, has true and everlasting power over all? If
you consider Him in the character of Father, He supplies to us our entrance to the light
which we enjoy: through Him we live, through Him we have entered into the abode1789 of
this world. If you contemplate Him as God, it is He who nourishes us with innumerable
resources: it is He who sustains us, we dwell in His house, we are His household; 1790 and
if we are less obedient than was befitting, and less attentive to our duty1791 than the endless
merits of our Master and Parent demanded: nevertheless it is, of great avail to our obtaining
pardon, if we retain the worship and knowledge of Him; if, laying aside low and earthly affairs
and goods, we meditate upon heavenly and divine things which are everlasting. And that
we may be able to do this, God must be followed by us, God must be adored and loved; since
there is in Him the substance1792 of things, the principle1793 of the virtues, and the source
of all that is good.</p>
<p>For what is greater in power than God, or more perfect in reason, or brighter in clearness?
And since He begat us to wisdom, and produced us to righteousness, it is not allowable for
man to forsake God, who is the giver of intelligence and life and to serve earthly and frail
things, or, intent upon seeking temporal goods, to turn aside from innocence and piety.
Vicious and deadly pleasures do not render a man happy; nor does opulence, which is the
inciter of lusts; nor empty ambition; nor frail honours, by which the human soul, being ensnared
and enslaved to the body, is condemned1794 to eternal death: but innocence and
righteousness alone, the lawful and due reward of which is immortality, which God from
the beginning appointed for holy and uncorrupted minds, which keep themselves pure and

uncontaminated from vices, and from every earthly impurity. Of this heavenly and eternal
reward they cannot be partakers, who have polluted their conscience by deeds of violence,
frauds, rapine, and deceits; and who, by injuries inflicted upon men, by impious actions,
have branded themselves1795 with indelible stains. Accordingly it is befitting that all who
wish deservedly to be called wise, who wish to be called men, should despise frail things,
should trample upon earthly things, and should look down upon base1796 things, that they
may be able to be united in a most blissful relationship with God.</p>
<p>Let impiety and discords be removed; let turbulent and deadly dissensions be allayed,1797
by which human societies and the divine union of the public league are broken in upon,
divided, and dispersed; as far as we can, let us aim at being good and bounteous: if we have
a supply of wealth and resources, let it not be devoted to the pleasure of a single person, but
bestowed on the welfare of many. For pleasure is as short lived as the body to which it does
service. But justice and kindness are as immortal as the mind and soul, which by good works
attain to the likeness of God. Let God be consecrated by us, not in temples, but in our heart.
All things which are made by the hand are destructible.1798 Let us cleanse this temple, which
is defiled not by smoke or dust, but by evil thoughts which is lighted not by blazing tapers1799
but by the brightness and light of wisdom. And if we believe that God is always present in
this temple, to whose divinity the secrets of the heart are open, we shall so live as always to
have Him propitious, and never to fear His anger.</p>

<p>It is worth while to direct attention to (book vi. cap. 2) what our author has said of “true
worship,” just now, when the most violent and persistent efforts are made to sensualize
Christian worship, and to explain away the testimony of the Ante-Nicene Fathers on this
important subject. The argument of our author, in its entire drift, is as applicable to our
own times as to his; and, deeply as I value beauty in the public worship of God, I cannot, as
a Nicene Catholic, do less than adopt the universal sentiment of the early Fathers as to the

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="644"/>
<head>CHAP. I.—THE INTRODUCTION, AND EXHORTATION TO DEMETRIANUS.1800</head>
<p>How disturbed I am, and in the greatest necessities, you will be able to judge from this
little book which I have written to you, Demetrianus, almost in unadorned words, as the
mediocrity of my talent permitted, that you might know my daily pursuit, and that I might
not be wanting to you, even now an instructor, but of a more honourable subject and of a
better system. For if you afforded yourself a ready hearer in literature, which did nothing
else than form the style, how much more teachable ought you to be in these true studies,
which have reference even to the life! And I now profess to you, that I am hindered by no
necessity of circumstance or time from composing something by which the philosophers
of our sect1801 which we uphold may become better instructed and more learned for the
future, although they now have a bad reputation, and are commonly reproved, as living
otherwise than is befitting for wise men, and as concealing their vices under the covering
of a name; whereas they ought either to have remedied them, or to have altogether avoided
them, that they might render the name of wisdom happy and uncorrupted, their life itself
agreeing with their precepts. I, however, shrink from no labour that I may at once instruct
ourselves and others. For I am not able to forget myself, and especially at that time when it
is most necessary for me to remember; as also you do not forget yourself, as I hope and wish.
For although the necessity of the state may turn you aside from true and just works, yet it
is impossible that a mind conscious of rectitude should not from time to time look to the
heaven.</p>
<p>I indeed rejoice that all things which are esteemed blessings turn out prosperously to
you, but only on condition of their changing nothing of your state of mind. For I fear lest
custom and the pleasantness of these subjects should, as usually happens, creep by degrees
into your mind. Therefore I advise you,
<lg>
<l>“And repeating it, will again and again advise you,”1802</l>
</lg>
not to believe that you have these enjoyments of the earth as great or true blessings, since
they are not only deceitful because they are doubtful, but also treacherous because they are
pleasant. For you know how crafty that wrestler and adversary of ours is, and also often violent,
as we now see that he is. He employs all these things which are able to entice as snares,
and with such subtilty that they escape the notice of the eyes of the mind, so that they cannot
be avoided by the foresight of man. Therefore it is the highest prudence to advance step by
step, since he occupies the passes on both sides, and secretly places stumbling-blocks for
our feet. Accordingly I advise you, either to disregard, if you are able according to your

virtue, your prosperity in which you live, or not to admire it greatly. Remember your true
parent, and in what1803 city you have given your name, and of what rank you have been.
You understand assuredly what I say. For I do not charge you with pride, of which there is
not even a suspicion in your case; but the things which I say are to be referred to the mind,
not to the body, the whole system of which has been arranged on this account, that it may
be in subjection to the soul as to a master, and may be ruled by its will. For it is in a certain
manner an earthen vessel in which the soul, that is, the true man himself, is contained, and
that vessel indeed not made by Prometheus, as the poets say, but by that supreme Creator
and Artificer of the world, God, whose divine providence and most perfect excellence it is
neither possible to comprehend by the perception, nor to express in word.</p>
<p>I will attempt, however, since mention has been made of the body and soul, to explain
the nature of each, as far as the weakness of my understanding sees through; and I think
that this duty is especially to be undertaken on this account, because Marcus Tullius, a man
of remarkable talent, in his fourth book on the Republic, when he had attempted to do this,
concluded a subject of wide extent within narrow limits, lightly selecting the chief points.
And that there might be no excuse, because he had not followed up this subject, he testified
that neither inclination nor attention had been wanting to him. For in his first book concerning
the Laws, when he was concisely summing up the same subject, he thus spoke:
“Scipio, as it appears to me, has sufficiently expressed this subject in those books which you
have read.” Afterwards, however, in his second book concerning the Nature of the Gods,
he endeavoured to follow up the same subject more extensively. But since he did not express
it sufficiently even there, I will approach this office, and will take upon myself boldly to explain
that which a man of the greatest eloquence has almost left untouched. Perhaps you
may blame me for attempting to discuss something in matters of obscurity, when you see
that there have been men of such rashness who are commonly called philosophers, that they
scrutinized those things which God willed to be abstruse and hidden, and investigated the
nature of things in heaven and on earth, which are far removed from us, and cannot be examined1804
by the eyes, nor touched by the hand, nor perceived by the senses; and yet they
so dispute concerning the nature of these things, as to wish that the things which they bring
forward may appear to be proved and known. What reason is there, I pray, why any one
should think it an invidious thing in us, if we wish to look into and contemplate the system
of our body,1805 which is not altogether obscure, because from the very offices of the limbs,

<head>CHAP. II.—OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE BEASTS AND OF MAN.</head>
<p>For our Creator and Parent, God, has given to man perception and reason, that it might
be evident from this that we are descended from Him, because He Himself is intelligence,
He Himself is perception and reason. Since He did not give that power of reason to the
other animals, He provided beforehand in what manner their life might be more safe. For
He clothed them all with their own natural hair,1806 in order that they might more easily
be able to endure the severity of frosts and colds. Moreover, He has appointed to every kind
its own peculiar defence for the repelling of attacks from without; so that they may either
oppose the stronger animals with natural weapons, or the feebler ones may withdraw
themselves from danger by the swiftness of their flight, or those which require at once both
strength and swiftness may protect themselves by craft, or guard themselves in hidingplaces.
1807 And so others of them either poise themselves aloft with light plumage, or are
supported by hoofs,1808 or are furnished with horns; some have arms in their
mouth—namely, their teeth1809—or hooked talons on their feet; and none of them is destitute
of a defence for its own protection.</p>
<p>But if any fall as a prey to the greater animals, that their race might not utterly perish,
they have either been banished to that region where the greater ones cannot exist, or they
have received a more abundant fruitfulness in production, that food might be supplied from
them to the beasts which are nourished by blood, and yet their very multitude might survive
the slaughter inflicted upon them, so as to preserve the race.1810 But He made man—reason
being granted to him, and the power of perceiving and speaking being given to him—destitute
of those things which are given to the other animals, because wisdom was able to supply
those things which the condition of nature had denied to him. He made him naked and
defenceless, because he could be armed by his talent, and clothed by his reason.1811 But it
cannot be expressed how wonderfully the absence of those things which are given to the
brutes contributes to the beauty of man. For if He had given to man the teeth of wild beasts,
or horns, or claws, or hoofs, or a tail, or hairs of various colour, who cannot perceive how
misshapen an animal he would be, as the dumb animals, if they were made naked and defenceless?
For if you take from these the natural clothing of their body, or those things by
which they are armed of themselves, they can be neither beautiful nor safe, so that they appear

<head>CHAP. III.—OF THE CONDITION OF THE BEASTS AND MAN.</head>
<p>They complain that man is born in a more feeble and frail condition than that in which
the other animals are born: for that these, as soon as they are produced from the womb,
immediately raise themselves on their feet, and express their joy by running to and fro, and
are at once fit for enduring the air, inasmuch as they have come forth to the light protected
by natural coverings; but man, on the contrary, being naked and defenceless, is cast forth,
and driven, as it were, from a shipwreck, to the miseries of this life; who is neither able to
move himself from the place where he has been born,1813 nor to seek the nourishment of
milk, nor to endure the injury of time. Therefore they say that Nature is not the mother of
the human race, but a stepmother, who has dealt so liberally with the dumb creation, but
has so produced man, that, without resources, and without strength, and destitute of all aid,
he can do nothing else than give tokens1814 of the state of his frailty by wailing and lamentations;
“as well he may, whose destiny it is to go through in life so many ills.”1815</p>
<p>And when they say these things they are believed to be very wise, because every one
without consideration is displeased with his own condition; but I contend that they are
never more foolish than when they say these things.1816 For when I consider the condition
of things, I understand that nothing ought to have been otherwise than it is—not to say
could have been otherwise, for God is able to do all things: but it must be, that that most
provident majesty made that which was better and more right.</p>
<p>I should like, therefore, to ask those censurers of the divine works, what they think to
be wanting in man, on account of his being born in a more feeble condition. Do they think
that men are, on this account, brought up worse? Or that they advance the less to the greatest
strength of age? Or that weakness is a hindrance to their growth or safety, since reason bestows1817
the things which are wanting? But, they say, the bringing up of man costs the
greatest labours: in truth, the condition of the brute creation is better, because all these,
when they have brought forth their young, have no care except for their own food; from
which it is effected that, their teats being spontaneously distended, the nourishment of milk
is supplied to their offspring, and that they seek this nourishment by the compulsion of
nature, without any trouble on the part of the mothers. How is it with birds, which have a
different nature? do they not undergo the greatest labours in bringing up their young, so
that they sometimes appear to have something of human intelligence? For they either build

<pb n="650"/>
their nests of mud, or construct them with twigs and leaves, and they sit upon the eggs
without taking food; and since it has not been given to them to nourish their young from
their own bodies, they convey to them food, and spend whole days in going to and fro in
this manner; but by night they defend, cherish, and protect them. What more can men do?
unless it be this only, that they do not drive away their young when grown up, but retain
them bound by perpetual relationship and the bond of affection. Why should I say that the
offspring of birds is much more fragile than that of man? Inasmuch as they do not bring
forth the animal itself from the body of the mother, but that which, being warmed by the
nourishment and heat of the body of the mother, produces the animal; and this, even when
animated by breath, being unfledged and tender, is not only without the power of flying,
but even of walking. Would he not, therefore, be most senseless, if any one should think
that nature has dealt badly with birds, first, because they are twice born, and then because
they are so weak, that they have to be nourished by food sought with labour by their parents?
But they select the stronger, and pass by the more feeble animals.</p>
<p>I ask, therefore, from those who prefer the condition of the beasts to their own, what
they would choose if God should give them the choice: would they prefer the wisdom of
man together with his weakness, or the strength of the beasts together with their nature? In
truth, they are not so much like the beasts as not to prefer even a much more fragile condition,
provided that it be human, to that strength of theirs unattended with reason. But, in truth,
prudent men neither desire the reason of man together with frailty, nor the strength of the
dumb animals without reason. Therefore it is nothing so repugnant or contradictory,1818
that either reason or the condition of nature should of necessity prepare each animal. If it
is furnished with natural protection, reason is superfluous. For what will it contrive?1819
What will it do? Or what will it plan? Or in what will it display that light of the intellect,
when Nature of its own accord grants those things which are able to be the result of reason?
But if it be endued with reason, what need will there be of defences for the body, when
reason once granted is able to supply the office of nature? And this has such power for the
adorning and protection of man, that nothing greater or better can be given by God. Finally,
since man is possessed of a body which is not great, and of slight strength, and of infirm
health, nevertheless, since he has received that which is of greater value, he is better equipped
than the other animals, and more adorned. For though he is born frail and feeble, yet he is
safe from all the dumb animals, and all those which are born with greater strength, though
they are able to bear patiently the inclemency of the sky, yet are unable to be safe from man.
Thus it comes to pass that reason bestows more on man than nature does on the dumb an-

<pb n="651"/>
imals; since, in their case, neither greatness of strength nor firmness of body can prevent
them from being oppressed by us, or from being made subject to our power.</p>
<p>Can any one, then, when he sees that even elephants,1820 with their vast bodies and
strength, are subservient to man, complain respecting God, the Maker of all things, because
he has received moderate strength, and a small body; and not estimate according to their
deserts the divine benefits towards himself, which is the part of an ungrateful man, or (to
speak more truly) of a madman? Plato, I believe, that he might refute these ungrateful men,
gave thanks to nature that he was born a man.1821 How much better and more soundly did
he act, who perceived that the condition of man was better, than they did who would have
preferred that they had been born beasts! For if God should happen to change them into
those animals whose condition they prefer to their own, they would now immediately desire
to return to their previous state, and would with great outcries eagerly demand their former
condition, because strength and firmness of body are not of such consequence that you
should be without the office of the tongue; or the free course of birds through the air, that
you should be without the hands. For the hands are of greater service than the lightness and
use of the wings; the tongue is of greater service than the strength of the whole body. What
madness is it, therefore, to prefer those things which, if they were given, you would refuse
to receive!</p>

<head>CHAP. IV.—OF THE WEAKNESS OF MAN.</head>
<p>They also complain that man is liable to diseases, and to untimely death. They are indignant,
it appears, that they are not born gods. By no means, they say; but we show from this,
that man was made with no foresight, which ought to have been otherwise. What if I shall
show, that this very thing was foreseen with great reason, that he might be able to be harassed
by diseases, and that his life might often be cut short in the midst of its course? For, since
God had known that the animal which He had made, of its own accord passed to death, that
it might be capable of receiving death itself, which is the dissolution of nature, He gave to
it frailty, which might find an approach for death in order to the dissolution of the animal.
For if it had been of such strength that disease and sickness could not approach it, not even
could death, since death is the consequence of diseases. But how could a premature death
be absent from him, for whom a mature death had been appointed? Assuredly they wish
that no man should die, unless when he has completed his hundredth year. How can they
maintain their consistency in so great an opposition of circumstances? For, in order that
no one may be capable of dying before a hundred years, something of the strength which
is immortal must be given to him; and when this is granted, the condition of death must
necessarily be excluded. But of what kind can that be, which can render a man firm and
impregnable against diseases and attacks from without? For, inasmuch as he is composed
of bones, and nerves, and flesh, and blood, which of these can be so firm as to repel frailty
and death? That man, therefore, may not be liable to dissolution before that time which
they think ought to have been appointed for him, of what material will they assign to him
a body? All things which can be seen and touched are frail. It remains that they seek something
from heaven, since there is nothing on earth which is not weak.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, man had to be so formed by God, that he should at some time be
mortal, the matter itself required that he should be made with a frail and earthly body. It is
necessary, therefore, that he should at some time receive death, since he is possessed of a
body; for everybody is liable to dissolution and to death. Therefore they are most foolish
who complain of premature death, since the condition of nature makes a place for it. Thus
it will follow that he is subject also to diseases; for nature does not admit that infirmity can
be absent from that body which is at some time to undergo dissolution. But let us suppose
it to be possible, as they wish, that man is not born under those conditions by which he is
subject to disease or death, unless, having completed the course of his life, he shall have arrived
at the extremity of old age. They do not, therefore, see what would be the consequence
if it were so arranged, that it would be plainly impossible to die at another time; but if any
one can be deprived of nourishment by another, it will be possible for him to die. Therefore
the case requires that man, who cannot die before an appointed day, should have no need
of the nourishment of food, because it may be taken from him; but if he shall have no need
of food, he will now not be a man, but will become a god. Therefore, as I have already said,

<pb n="653"/>
they who complain of the frailty of man, make this complaint especially, that they were not
born immortal and everlasting. No one ought to die unless he is old. On this account, in
truth, he ought to die, because he is not God. But mortality cannot be united with immortality:
for if a man is mortal in old age, he cannot be immortal in youth; neither is the condition
of death foreign to him who is at some time about to die; nor is there any immortality
to which a limit is appointed. Thus it comes to pass, that the exclusion of immortality for
ever, and the reception of mortality for a time, place man in such a condition that he is at
some time mortal.</p>
<p>Therefore the necessity is in all points suitable,1822 that he ought not to have been otherwise
than he is, and that it was impossible. But they do not see the order of consequences,
because they have once committed an error in the main point itself. For the divine providence
having been excluded from the affairs of men, it necessarily followed that all things were
produced of their own accord. Hence they invented the notion of those blows and fortuitous
meetings together of minute seeds, because they did not see the origin of things. And when
they had thrown themselves into this difficulty, necessity now compelled them to think that
souls were born together with bodies, and in like manner were extinguished together with
bodies; for they had made the assumption, that nothing was made by the divine mind. And
they were unable to prove this in any other way, than by showing that there were some
things in which the system of providence appeared to be at fault.1823 Therefore they blamed
those things in which providence wonderfully expressed its divinity, as those things which
I have related concerning diseases and premature death; whereas they ought to have considered,
these things being assumed, what would be the necessary consequences (but those
things which I have spoken are the consequences) if he were not liable to diseases, and did
not require a dwelling, nor clothing. For why should he fear the winds, or rains, or colds,
the power of which consists in this, that they bring diseases? For on this account he has received
wisdom, that he may guard his frailty against things that would injure him. The necessary
consequence is, that since he is liable to diseases for the sake of retaining his wisdom,
he must also be liable to death; because he to whom death does not come, must of necessity
be firm. But infirmity has in itself the condition of death; but where there shall be firmness,
neither can old age have any place, nor death, which follows old age.</p>
<p>Moreover, if death were appointed for a fixed age, man would become most arrogant,
and would be destitute of all humanity. For almost all the rights of humanity, by which we
are united with one another, arise from fear and the consciousness of frailty. In short, all
the more feeble and timid animals herd together, that, since they are unable to protect
themselves by strength, they may protect themselves by their multitude; but the stronger
<note type="footnote">1822 Quadrat.</note>
<note type="footnote">1823 Claudicare.</note>

<pb n="654"/>
animals seek solitudes, since they trust in their force and strength.1824 If man also, in the
same manner, had sufficient strength for the repelling of dangers, and did not stand in need
of the assistance of any other, what society would there be? Or what system? What humanity?
Or what would be more harsh than man? What more brutal? What more savage? But since
he is feeble, and not able to live by himself apart from man, he desires society, that his life,
passed in intercourse with others, may become both more adorned and more safe. You see,
therefore, that the whole reason of man centres most of all in this, that he is born naked and
fragile, that he is attacked by diseases, that he is punished by premature death. And if these
things should be taken away from man, reason also, and wisdom, must necessarily be taken
away. But I am discussing too long respecting things which are manifest, since it is clear
that nothing ever was made, or could have been made, without providence. And if I should
now wish to discuss respecting all its works in order, the subject would be infinite. But I
have purposed to speak so much concerning the body of man only, that I may show in it
the power of divine providence, how great it has been in those things only which are easy
of comprehension and open; for those things which relate to the soul can neither be subjected
to the eyes, nor comprehended. Now we speak concerning the vessel itself of man, which
we see.</p>

<head>CHAP. V.—OF THE FIGURES AND LIMBS OF ANIMALS.</head>
<p>In the beginning, when God was forming the animals, He did not wish to conglobate1825
and collect them into a round shape, that they might be able easily to put themselves in
motion for walking, and to turn themselves in any direction; but from the highest part of
the body He lengthened out the head. He also carried out to a greater length some of the
limbs, which are called feet, that, being fixed on the ground with alternate motions, they
might lead forward the animal wherever his inclination had borne him, or the necessity of
seeking food had called him. Moreover, He made four limbs standing out from the very
vessel of the body: two behind, which are in all animals—the feet; also two close to the head
and neck, which supply various uses to animals. For in cattle and wild beasts they are feet
like the hinder ones; but in man they are hands, which are produced not for walking, but
for acting and controlling.1826 There is also a third class, in which those former limbs are
neither feet nor hands; but wings, which, having feathers arranged in order, supply the use
of flying.1827 Thus one formation has different forms and uses; and that He might firmly
hold together the density itself of the body, by binding together greater and small bones,
He compacted a kind of keel, which we call the spine; and He did not think fit to form it of
one continued bone, lest the animal should not have the power of walking and bending itself.
From its middle part, as it were, He has extended in a different direction transverse and flat
bones, by which, being slightly curved, and almost drawn together to themselves as into a
circle, the inward organs1828 may be covered, that those parts which needed to be soft and
less strong might be protected by the encircling of a solid framework.1829 But at the end of
that joining together which we have said to resemble the keel of a ship, He placed the head,
in which might be the government of the whole living creature; and this name was given to
it, as indeed Varro writes to Cicero, because from this the senses and the nerves take their
beginning.</p>
<p>But those parts, which we have said to be lengthened out from the body, either for the
sake of walking, or of acting, or of flying, He would have to consist of bones, neither too
long, for the sake of rapidity of motion, nor too short, for the sake of firmness, but of a few,
and those large. For either they are two as in man, or four as in a quadruped. And these He
did not make solid, lest in walking sluggishness and weight should retard; but He made
them hollow, and full of marrow within, to preserve the vigour of the body. And again, He

<note type="footnote">1829 Cratis, properly “wicker-work.”</note>

<pb n="656"/>
did not make them equally extended to the end; but He conglobated their extremities with
coarse knots, that they might be able more easily to be bound with sinews, and to be turned
more easily, from which they are called joints.1830 These knots He made firmly solid, and
covered with a soft kind of covering, which is called cartilage; for this purpose, that they
might be bent without galling or any sense of pain. He did not, however, form these after
one fashion. For He made some simple and round into an orb, in those joints at least in
which it was befitting that the limbs should move in all directions, as in the shoulders, since
it is necessary that the hands should move and be twisted about in any direction; but others
He made broad, and equal, and round towards one part, and that plainly in those places
where only it was necessary for the limbs to be bent, as in the knees, and in the elbows, and
in the hands themselves. For as it was at the same time pleasant to the sight, and useful, that
the hands should move in every direction from that position from which they spring; so
assuredly, if this same thing should happen to the elbows, a motion of that kind would be
at once superfluous and unbecoming. For then the hand, having lost the dignity which it
now has, through its excessive flexibility,1831 would appear like the trunk of an elephant;
and man would be altogether snake-handed,1832—an instance of which has been wonderfully
effected in that monstrous beast. For God, who wished to display His providence and power
by a wonderful variety of many things, inasmuch as He had not extended the head of that
animal to such a length that he might be able to touch the earth with his mouth, which
would have been horrible and hideous, and because He had so armed the mouth itself with
extended tusks, that even if he touched the earth the tusks would still deprive him of the
power of feeding, He lengthened out between these from the top of the forehead a soft and
flexible limb, by which he might be able to grasp and lay hold of anything, lest the prominent
magnitude of the tusks, or the shortness of the neck, should interfere with the arrangement
for taking food.</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.—OF THE ERROR OF EPICURUS, AND OF THE LIMBS AND THEIR USE.</head>
<p>I cannot here be prevented from again showing the folly of Epicurus. For all the ravings
of Lucretius1833 belong to him, who, in order that he might show that animals are not produced
by any contrivance of the divine mind, but, as he is wont to say, by chance, said that
in the beginning of the world innumerable other animals of wonderful form and magnitude
were produced; but that they were unable to be permanent, because either the power of
taking food, or the method of uniting and generating, had failed them. It is evident that, in
order to make a place for his atoms flying about through the boundless and empty space,
he wished to exclude the divine providence. But when he saw that a wonderful system of
providence is contained in all things which breathe, what vanity was it (O mischievous one!)
to say that there had been animals of immense size, in which the system of production
ceased!</p>
<p>Since, therefore, all things which we see are produced with reference to a plan—for
nothing but a plan1834 can effect this very condition of being born—it is manifest that
nothing could have been born without a plan. For it was previously foreseen in the formation
of everything, how it should use the service of the limbs for the necessaries of life; and how
the offspring, being produced from the union of bodies, might preserve all living creatures
by their several species. For if a skilful architect, when he designs to construct some great
building, first of all considers what will be the effect1835 of the complete building, and previously
ascertains by measurement what situation is suitable for a light weight, in what place
a massive part of the structure will stand, what will be the intervals between the columns,
what or where will be the descents and outlets of the falling waters and the reservoirs,—he
first, I say, foresees these things, that he may begin together with the very foundations
whatever things are necessary for the work when now completed,—why should any one
suppose that, in the contrivance of animals, God did not foresee what things were necessary
for living, before giving life itself? For it is manifest that life could not exist, unless those
things by which it exists were previously arranged.1836</p>
<p>Therefore Epicurus saw in the bodies of animals the skill of a divine plan; but that he
might carry into effect that which he had before imprudently assumed, he added another
absurdity agreeing with the former. For he said that the eyes were not produced for seeing,
nor the ears for hearing, nor the feet for walking, since these members were produced before
<note type="footnote">1833 [Yet Lucretuis has originality and genius of an order far nobler than that of moderns who copy his follies.]</note>

<pb n="658"/>
there was the exercise of seeing, hearing, and walking; but that all the offices of these members
arose from them after their production.1837 I fear lest the refutation of such extravagant
and ridiculous stories should appear to be no less foolish; but it pleases me to be foolish,
since we are dealing with a foolish man, lest he should think himself too clever.1838 What
do you say, Epicurus? Were not the eyes produced for seeing? Why, then, do they see? Their
use, he says, afterwards showed itself. Therefore they were produced for the sake of seeing,
since they can do nothing else but see. Likewise, in the case of the other limbs, use itself
shows for what purpose they were produced. For it is plain that this use could have no existence,
unless all the limbs had been made with such arrangement and foresight, that they
might be able to have their use.</p>
<p>For what if you should say, that birds were not made to fly, nor wild beasts to rage, nor
fishes to swim, nor men to be wise, when it is evident that living creatures are subject to that
natural disposition and office to which each was created? But it is evident that he who has
lost the main point itself of the truth must always be in error. For if all things are produced
not by providence, but by a fortuitous meeting together of atoms, why does it never happen
by chance, that those first principles meet together in such a way as to make an animal of
such a kind, that it might rather hear with its nostrils, smell with its eyes, and see1839 with
its ears? For if the first principles leave no kind of position untried, monstrous productions
of this kind ought daily to have been brought forth, in which the arrangement of the limbs
might be distorted,1840 and the use far different from that which prevails. But since all the
races of animals, and all the limbs, observe their own laws and arrangements, and the uses
assigned to them, it is plain that nothing is made by chance, since a perpetual arrangement
of the divine plan is preserved. But we will refute Epicurus at another time. Now let us discuss
the subject of providence, as we have begun.</p>

<head>CHAP. VII.—OF ALL THE PARTS OF THE BODY.</head>
<p>God therefore connected and bound together the parts which strengthen1841 the body,
which we call bones, being knotted and joined to one another by sinews, which the mind
might make use of, as bands,1842 if it should wish to hasten forward or to lag behind; and,
indeed, without any labour or effort, but with a very slight inclination, it might moderate
and guide the mass of the whole body. But He covered these with the inward organs,1843 as
was befitting to each place, that the parts which were solid might be enclosed and concealed.
Also He mixed with the inward organs, veins as streams divided through the whole body,
through which the moisture and the blood, running in different directions, might bedew
all the limbs with the vital juices; and He fashioned these inward organs after that manner
which was befitting to each kind and situation, and covered them with skin drawn over
them, which He either adorned with beauty only, or covered with thick hair, or fenced with
scales, or adorned with brilliant feathers. But that is a wonderful contrivance of God, that
one arrangement and one state exhibits innumerable varieties of animals. For in almost all
things which breathe there is the same connection and arrangement of the limbs. For first
of all is the head, and annexed to this the neck; also the breast adjoined to the neck, and the
shoulders projecting from it, the belly adhering to the breast; also the organs of generation
subjoined to the belly; in the last place, the thighs and feet. Nor do the limbs only keep their
own course and position in all, but also the parts of the limbs. For in the head itself alone
the ears occupy a fixed position, the eyes a fixed position, likewise the nostrils, the mouth
also, and in the teeth and tongue. And though all these things are the same in all animals,
yet there is an infinite and manifold diversity of the things formed; because those things of
which I have spoken, being either more drawn out or more contracted, are comprehended
by lineaments differing in various ways. What! is not that divine, that in so great a multitude
of living creatures each animal is most excellent in its own class and species?—so that if any
part should be taken from one to another, the necessary result would be, that nothing would
be more embarrassed for use, nothing more unshapely to look upon; as if you should give
a prolonged neck to an elephant, or a short neck to a camel; or if you should attach feet or
hair to serpents, in which the length of the body equally stretched out required nothing else,
except that being marked as to their backs with spots, and supporting themselves by their
smooth scales, with winding courses they should glide into slippery tracts. But in quadrupeds
the same designer lengthened out the arrangement of the spine, which is drawn out from
the top of the head to a greater length on the outside of the body, and pointed it into a tail,
that the parts of the body which are offensive might either be covered on account of their

unsightliness, or be protected on account of their tenderness, so that by its motion certain
minute and injurious animals might be driven away from the body; and if you should take
away this member, the animal would be imperfect and weak. But where there is reason and
the hand, that is not so necessary as a covering of hair. To such an extent are all things most
befittingly arranged, each in its own class, that nothing can be conceived more unbecoming
than a quadruped which is naked, or a man that is covered.</p>
<p>But, however, though nakedness itself on the part of man tends in a wonderful manner
to beauty, yet it was not adapted to his head; for what great deformity there would be in
this, is evident from baldness. Therefore He clothed the head with hair; and because it was
about to be on the top, He added it as an ornament, as it were, to the highest summit of the
building. And this ornament is not collected into a circle, or rounded into the figure of a
cap, lest it should be unsightly by leaving some parts bare; but it is freely poured forth in
some places, and withdrawn in others, according to the comeliness of each place. Therefore,
the forehead entrenched by a circumference, and the hair put forth from the temples before
the ears, and the uppermost parts of these being surrounded after the manner of a crown,
and all the back part of the head covered, display an appearance of wonderful comeliness.
Then the nature of the beard contributes in an incredible degree to distinguish the maturity
of bodies, or to the distinction of sex, or to the beauty of manliness and strength; so that it
appears that the system of the whole work would not have been in agreement, if anything
had been made otherwise than it is.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.—OF THE PARTS OF MAN: THE EYES AND EARS.</head>
<p>Now I will show the plan of the whole man, and will explain the uses and habits of the
several members which are exposed to view in the body, or concealed. When, therefore,
God had determined of all the animals to make man alone heavenly, and all the rest earthly,
He raised him erect1844 to the contemplation of the heaven, and made him a biped, doubtless
that he might look to the same quarter from which he derives his origin; but He depressed
the others to the earth, that, inasmuch as they have no expectation of immortality, being
cast down with their whole body to the ground, they might be subservient to their appetite
and food. And thus the right reason and elevated position of man alone, and his countenance,
shared with and closely resembling God his Father, bespeak his origin and Maker.1845 His
mind, nearly divine, because it has obtained the rule not only over the animals which are
on the earth, but even over his own body, being situated in the highest part, the head, as in
a lofty citadel, looks out upon and observes all things. He formed this its palace, not drawn
out and extended, as in the case of the dumb animals, but like an orb and a globe, because
all1846 roundness belongs to a perfect plan and figure. Therefore the mind and that divine
fire is covered with it,1847 as with a vault;1848 and when He had covered its highest top with
a natural garment, He alike furnished and adorned the front part which is called the face,
with the necessary services of the members.</p>
<p>And first, He closed the orbs of the eyes with concave apertures, from which boring1849
Varro thought that the forehead1850 derived its name; and He would have these to be neither
less nor more than two, because no number is more perfect as to appearance than that of
two: as also He made the ears two, the doubleness1851 of which bears with it an incredible
degree of beauty, both because each part is adorned with a resemblance, and that voices
coming from both sides1852 may more easily be collected. For the form itself is fashioned
after a wonderful manner: because He would not have their apertures to be naked and uncovered,
which would have been less becoming and less useful; since the voice might fly
beyond the narrow space of simple caverns, and be scattered, did not the apertures themselves
confine it, received through hollow windings and kept back from reverberation, like those

small vessels, by the application of which narrow-mouthed vessels are accustomed to be
filled.</p>
<p>These ears, then, which have their name from the drinking1853 in of voices, from which
Virgil says,1854
<lg>
<l>“And with these ears I drank in his voice;”</l>
</lg>
or because the Greeks call the voice itself αὐδήν, from hearing,—the ears (aures) were named
as though audes by the change of a letter,—God would not form of soft skins, which, hanging
down and flaccid, might take away beauty; nor of hard and solid bones, lest, being stiff and
immoveable, they should be inconvenient for use. But He designed that which might be
between these, that a softer cartilage might bind them, and that they might have at once a
befitting and flexible firmness. In these the office of bearing only is placed, as that of seeing
is in the eyes, the acuteness of which is especially inexplicable and wonderful; for He covered
their orbs, presenting the similitude of gems in that part with which they had to see, with
transparent membranes, that the images of objects placed opposite them, being refracted1855
as in a mirror, might penetrate to the innermost perception. Through these membranes,
therefore, that faculty which is called the mind sees those things which are without; lest you
should happen to think that we see either by the striking1856 of the images, as the philosophers
discuss, since the office of seeing ought to be in that which sees, not in that which is seen;
or in the tension of the air together with the eyesight; or in the outpouring of the rays: since,
if it were so, we should see the ray towards which we turn with our eyes, until the air, being
extended together with the eyesight, or the rays being poured out, should arrive at the object
which was to be seen.</p>
<p>But since we see at the same moment of time, and for the most part, while engaged on
other business, we nevertheless behold all things which are placed opposite to us, it is more
true and evident that it is the mind which, through the eyes, sees those things which are
placed opposite to it, as though through windows covered with pellucid crystal or transparent
stone;1857 and therefore the mind and inclination are often known from the eyes. For the
refutation of which Lucretius1858 employed a very senseless argument. For if the mind, he
says, sees through the eye, it would see better if the eyes were torn out and dug up, inasmuch

as doors being torn up together with the door-posts let in more light than if they were
covered. Truly his eyes, or rather those of Epicurus who taught him, ought to have been
dug out, that they might not see, that the torn-out orbs, and the burst fibres of the eyes, and
the blood flowing through the veins, and the flesh increasing from wounds, and the scars
drawn over at last can admit no light; unless by chance he would have it that eyes are pro-
duced resembling ears, so that we should see not so much with eyes as with apertures, than
which there can be nothing more unsightly or more useless. For how little should we be
able to see, if from the innermost recesses of the head the mind should pay attention through
slight fissures of caverns; as, if any one should wish to look through a stalk of hemlock, he
would see no more than the capability of the stalk itself admitted! For sight, therefore, it
was rather needful that the members should be collected together into an orb, that the sight
might be spread in breadth and the parts which adjoined them in the front of the face, that
they might freely behold all things. Therefore the unspeakable power of the divine providence
made two orbs most resembling each other, and so bound them together that they might
be able not only to be altogether turned, but to be moved and directed with moderation.1859
And He willed that the orbs themselves should be full of a pure and clear moisture, in the
middle part of which sparks of lights might be kept shut up, which we call the pupils, in
which, being pure and delicate, are contained the faculty and method of seeing. The mind
therefore directs itself through these orbs that it may see, and the sight of both the eyes is
mingled and joined together in a wonderful manner.</p>

<head>CHAP. IX.—OF THE SENSES AND THEIR POWER.</head>
<p>It pleases me in this place to censure the folly of those who, while they wish to show
that the senses are false, collect many instances in which the eyes are deceived; and among
them this also, that all things appear double to the mad and intoxicated, as though the cause
of that error were obscure. For it happens on this account, because there are two eyes. But
hear how it happens. The sight of the eyes consists in the exertion of the soul. Therefore,
since the mind, as has been above said, uses the eyes as windows, this happens not only to
those who are intoxicated or mad, but even to those who are of sound mind, and sober. For
if you place any object too near, it will appear double, for there is a certain interval and space
in which the sight of the eyes meets together. Likewise, if you call the soul back as if to reflection,
and relax the exertion of the mind, then the sight of each eye is drawn asunder, and
they each begin to see separately.</p>
<p>If you, again, exert the mind and direct the eyesight, whatever appeared double unites
into one. What wonder, therefore, if the mind, impaired by poison and the powerful influence
of wine, cannot direct itself to seeing, as the feet cannot to walking when they are weak
through the numbness of the sinews, or if the force of madness raging against the brain
disunites the agreement of the eyes? Which is so true, that in the case of one-eyed1860 men,
if they become either mad or intoxicated, it can by no means happen that they see any object
double. Wherefore, if the reason is evident why the eyes are deceived, it is clear that the
senses are not false: for they either are not deceived if they are pure and sound; or if they
are deceived, yet the mind is not deceived which recognises their error.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.—OF THE OUTER LIMBS OF MAN, AND THEIR USE.</head>
<p>But let us return to the works of God. That the eyes, therefore, might be better protected
from injury, He concealed them with the coverings of the eyelashes,1861 from which Varro
thinks that the eyes1862 derived their name. For even the eyelids themselves, in which there
is the power of rapid motion, and to which throbbing1863 gives their name, being protected
by hairs standing in order, afford a most becoming fence to the eyes; the continual motion
of which, meeting with incomprehensible rapidity, does not impede the course of the sight,
and relieves the eyes.1864 For the pupil—that is, the transparent membrane—which ought
not to be drained and to become dry, unless it is cleansed by continual moisture so that it
shines clearly, loses its power.1865 Why should I speak of the summits of the eyebrows
themselves, furnished with short hair? Do they not, as it were by mounds, both afford protection
to the eyes, so that nothing may fall into them from above,1866 and at the same time
ornament? And the nose, arising from the confines of these, and stretched out, as it were,
with an equal ridge, at once serves to separate and to protect the two eyes. Below also, a not
unbecoming swelling of the cheeks, gently rising after the similitude of hills, makes the eyes
safer on every side; and it has been provided by the great Artificer, that if there shall happen
to be a more violent blow, it may be repelled by the projecting parts. But the upper part of
the nose as far as the middle has been made solid; but the lower part has been made with a
softened cartilage annexed to it, that it may be pliant1867 to the use of the fingers. Moreover,
in this, though a single member, three offices are placed: one, that of drawing the breath;
the second, that of smelling; the third, that the secretions of the brain may escape through
its caverns. And in how wonderful, how divine a manner did God contrive these also, so
that the very cavity of the nose should not deform the beauty of the face: which would certainly
have been the case if one single aperture only were open. But He enclosed and divided
that, as though by a wall drawn through the middle, and made it most beautiful by the very
circumstance of its being double.1868 From which we understand of how much weight the
twofold number, made firm by one simple connection, is to the perfection of things.</p>

<p>For though the body is one, yet the whole could not be made up of single members,
unless it were that there should be parts on the right hand or on the left. Therefore, as the
two feet and also hands not only avail to some utility and practice either of walking or of
doing something, but also bestow an admirable character and comeliness; so in the head,
which is, as it were, the crown of the divine work, the hearing has been divided by the great
Artificer into two ears, and the sight into two eyes, and the smelling into two nostrils, because
the brain, in which is contained the system of the sensation, although it is one, yet is divided
into two parts by the intervening membrane. But the heart also, which appears to be the
abode of wisdom, although it is one, yet has two recesses within, in which are contained the
living fountains of blood, divided by an intervening barrier: that as in the world itself the
chief control, being twofold from simple matter, or simple from a twofold matter, governs
and keeps together the whole; so in the body, all the parts, being constructed of two, might
present an inseparable unity. Also how useful and how becoming is the appearance and the
opening of the mouth transversely cannot be expressed; the use of which consists in two
offices, that of taking food and speaking.</p>
<p>The tongue enclosed within, which by its motions divides the voice into words, and is
the interpreter of the mind, cannot, however, by itself alone fulfil the office of speaking,
unless it strikes its edge against the palate, unless aided by striking against the teeth or by
the compression of the lips. The teeth, however, contribute more to speaking: for infants
do not begin to speak before they have teeth; and old men, when they have lost their teeth,
so lisp that they appear to have returned afresh to infancy. But these things relate to man
alone, or to birds, in which the tongue, being pointed and vibrating with fixed motions,
expresses innumerable inflexions of songs and various kinds of sounds. It has, moreover,
another office also, which it exercises in all, and this alone in the dumb animals, that it collects
the food when bruised and ground by the teeth, and by its force presses it down when collected
into balls, and transmits it to the belly. Accordingly, Varro thinks that the name of
tongue was given to it from binding1869 the food. It also assists the beasts in drinking: for
with the tongue stretched out and hollowed they draw water; and when they have taken it
in the hollow1870 of the tongue, lest by slowness and delay it should flow away, they dash1871
it against the palate with swift rapidity. This, therefore, is covered by the concave part of
the palate as by a shell,1872 and God has surrounded it with the enclosure of the teeth as
with a wall.</p>

<p>But He has adorned the teeth themselves, which are arranged in order in a wonderful
manner, lest, being bare and exposed,1873 they should be a terror rather than an ornament,
with soft gums, which are so named from producing teeth, and then with the coverings of
the lips; and the hardness of the teeth, as in a millstone, is greater and rougher than in the
other bones, that they might be sufficient for bruising the food and pasture. But how befittingly
has He divided1874 the lips themselves, which as it were before were united! the upper
of which, under the very middle of the nostrils, He has marked with a kind of slight cavity,
as with a valley: He has gracefully spread out1875 the lower for the sake of beauty. For, as
far as relates to the receiving of flavour, he is deceived, whoever he is, who thinks that this
sense resides in the palate; for it is the tongue by which flavours are perceived, and not the
whole of it: for the parts of it which are more tender on either side, draw in the flavour with
the most delicate perceptions. And though nothing is diminished from that which is eaten
or drunk, yet the flavour in an indescribable manner penetrates to the sense, in the same
way in which the taking of the smell detracts nothing from any material.</p>
<p>And how beautiful the other parts are can scarcely be expressed. The chin, gently drawn
down from the cheeks, and the lower part of it so closed that the lightly imprinted division
appears to mark its extreme point: the neck stiff and well rounded: the shoulders let down
as though by gentle ridges from the neck: the fore-arms1876 powerful, and braced1877 by
sinews for firmness: the great strength of the upper-arms1878 standing out with remarkable
muscles: the useful and becoming bending of the elbows. What shall I say of the hands, the
ministers of reason and wisdom? Which the most skilful Creator made with a flat and
moderately concave bend, that if anything was to be held, it might conveniently rest upon
them, and terminated them in the fingers; in which it is difficult to explain whether the appearance
or the usefulness is greater. For the perfection and completeness of their number,
and the comeliness of their order and gradation, and the flexible bending of the equal joints,
and the round form of the nails, comprising and strengthening the tips of the fingers with
concave coverings, lest the softness of the flesh should yield in holding any object, afford
great adornment. But this is convenient for use, in wonderful ways, that one separated from
the rest rises together with the hand itself, and is enlarged1879 in a different direction, which,
offering itself as though to meet the others, possesses all the power of holding and doing

either alone, or in a special manner, as the guide and director of them all; from which also
it received the name of thumb,1880 because it prevails among the others by force and power.
It has two joints standing out, not as the others, three; but one is annexed by flesh to the
hand for the sake of beauty: for if it had been with three joints, and itself separate, the foul
and unbecoming appearance would have deprived the hand of all grace.</p>
<p>Again, the breadth of the breast, being elevated, and exposed to the eyes, displays a
wonderful dignity of its condition; of which this is the cause, that God appears to have made
man only, as it were, reclining with his face upward: for scarcely any other animal is able to
lie upon its back. But He appears to have formed the dumb animals as though lying on one
side, and to have pressed them to the earth. For this reason He gave them a narrow breast,
and removed from sight, and prostrate1881 towards the earth. But He made that of man
open and erect, because, being full of reason given from heaven, it was not befitting that it
should be humble or unbecoming. The nipples also gently rising, and crowned with darker
and small orbs, add something of beauty; being given to females for the nourishment of
their young, to males for grace only, that the breast might not appear misshapen, and, as it
were, mutilated. Below this is placed the fiat surface of the belly, about the middle of which
the navel distinguishes by a not unbecoming mark, being made for this purpose, that through
it the young, while it is in the womb, may be nourished.</p>

<head>CHAP. XI.—OF THE INTESTINES IN MAN, AND THEIR USE.</head>
<p>It necessarily follows that I should begin to speak of the inward parts also, to which has
been assigned not beauty, because they are concealed from view, but incredible utility, since
it was necessary that this earthly body should be nourished with some moisture from food
and drink, as the earth itself is by showers and frosts. The most provident Artificer placed
in the middle of it a receptacle for articles of food, by means of which, when digested and
liquefied, it might distribute the vital juices to all the members. But since man is composed
of body and soul, that receptacle of which I have spoken above affords nourishment only
to the body; to the soul, in truth, He has given another abode. For He has made a kind of
intestines soft and thin,1882 which we call the lungs, into which the breath might pass by an
alternate interchange;1883 and He did not form this after the fashion of the uterus, lest the
breath should all at once be poured forth, or at once inflate it. And on this account He did
not make it a full intestine,1884 but capable of being inflated, and admitting the air, so that
it might gradually receive the breath; while the vital air is spread through that thinness, and
might again gradually give it back, while it spreads itself forth from it: for the very alternation
of blowing and breathing,1885 and the process of respiration, support life in the body.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, there are in man two receptacles,—one of the air which nourishes the
soul,1886 the other of the food which nourishes the body,—there must be two tubes1887
through the neck for food, and for breath, the upper of which leads from the mouth to the
belly, the lower from the nostrils to the lungs. And the plan and nature of these are different:
for the passage which is from the mouth has been made soft, and which when closed always
adheres1888 to itself, as the month itself; since drink and food, being corporeal, make for
themselves a space for passage, by moving aside and opening the gullet. The breath, on the
other hand, which is incorporeal and thin, because it was unable to make for itself a space,
has received an open way, which is called the windpipe. This is composed of flexible and
soft bones, as though of rings fitted together after the manner of a hemlock stalk,1889 and
adhering together; and this passage is always open. For the breath can have no cessation in

passing; because it, which is always passing to and fro, is checked as by a kind of obstacle
through means of a portion of a member usefully sent down from the brain, and which is
called the uvula, lest, drawn by pestilential air, it should come with impetuosity and spoil
the slightness1890 of its abode, or bring the whole violence of the injury upon the inner receptacles.
And on this account also the nostrils are slightly open, which are therefore so
named, because either smell or breath does not cease to flow1891 through these, which are,
as it were, the doors of this tube. Yet this breathing-tube lies open1892 not only to the nostrils,
but also to the mouth in the extreme regions of the palate, where the risings of1893 the jaws,
looking towards the uvula, begin to raise themselves into a swelling. And the reason of this
arrangement is not obscure: for we should not have the power of speaking if the windpipe
were open to the nostrils only, as the path of the gullet is to the mouth only; nor could the
breath proceeding from it cause the voice, without the service of the tongue.</p>
<p>Therefore the divine skill opened a way for the voice from that breathing-tube, so that
the tongue might be able to discharge its office, and by its strokes divide into words the
even1894 course of the voice itself. And this passage, if by any means it is intercepted, must
necessarily cause dumbness. For he is assuredly mistaken, whoever thinks that there is any
other cause why men are dumb. For they are not tongue-tied, as is commonly believed; but
they pour forth that vocal breath through the nostrils, as though bellowing,1895 because
there is either no passage at all for the voice to the mouth, or it is not so open as to be able
to send forth the full voice. And this generally comes to pass by nature; sometimes also it
happens by accident that this entrance is blocked up and does not transmit the voice to the
tongue, and thus makes those who can speak dumb. And when this happens, the hearing
also must necessarily be blocked up; so that because it cannot emit the voice, it is also incapable
of admitting it. Therefore this passage has been opened for the purpose of speaking. It
also affords this advantage, that in frequenting the bath,1896 because the nostrils are not
able to endure the heat, the hot air is taken in by the mouth; also, if phlegm contracted by
cold shall have happened to stop up the breathing pores of the nostrils, we may be able to
draw the air through the mouth, lest, if the passage1897 should be obstructed, the breath
should be stifled. But the food being received into the stomach, and mixed with the moisture

of the drink, when it has now been digested by the heat, its juice, being in an indescribable
manner diffused through the limbs, bedews and invigorates the whole body.</p>
<p>The manifold coils also of the intestines, and their length rolled together on themselves,
and yet fastened with one band, are a wonderful work of God. For when the stomach has
sent forth from itself the food softened, it is gradually thrust forth through those windings
of the intestines, so that whatever of the moisture by which the body is nourished is in them,
is divided to all the members. And yet, lest in any place it should happen to adhere and remain
fixed, which might have taken place on account of the turnings of the coils,1898 which often
turn back to themselves, and which could not have happened without injury, He has spread
over1899 these from within a thicker juice, that the secretions of the belly might more easily
work their way through the slippery substance to their outlets. It is also a most skilful arrangement,
that the bladder, which birds do not use, though it is separated from the intestines,
and has no tube by which it may draw the urine from them, is nevertheless filled and distended
with moisture. And it is not difficult to see how this comes to pass. For the parts of the
intestines which receive the food and drink from the belly are more open than the other
coils, and much more delicate. These entwine themselves around and encompass the bladder;
and when the meat and the drink have arrived at these parts in a mixed state, the excrement
becomes more solid, and passes through, but all the moisture is strained through those
tender parts,1900 and the bladder, the membrane of which is equally fine and delicate, absorbs
and collects it, so as to send it forth where nature has opened an outlet.</p>

<head>CHAP. XII.—DE UTERO, ET CONCEPTIONE ATQUE SEXIBUS.1901</head>
<p>De utero quoque et conceptione, quoniam de internis loquimur, dici necesse est, ne
quid præ terisse videamur; quæ quamquam in operto latent, sensum tamen atque
intelligentiam latere non possunt. Vena in maribus, quæ seminium continet, duplex est,
paulo interior, quam illud humoris obscoeni receptaculum. Sicut enim renes duo sunt,
itemque testes, ita et venæ seminales duæ, in una tamen compage cohæ rentes; quod videmus
in corporibus animalium, cum interfecta1902 patefiunt. Sed illa dexterior masculinum
continet semen, sinisterior foemininum; et omnino in toto corpore pars dextra masculina
est, sinistra veto foeminina. Ipsum semen quidam putant ex medullis tantum, quidam ex
omni corpore ad venam genitalem confluere, ibique concrescere. Sed hoc, humana mens,
quomodo fiat, non potest comprehendere. Item in foeminis uterus in duas se dividit partes,
quæ in diversum diffussæ ac reflexæ, circumplicantur, sicut arietis cornua. Quæ pars in
dextram retorquetur, masculina est; quæ in sinistram, foeminina.</p>
<p>Conceptum igitur Varro et Aristoteles sic fieri arbitrantur. Aiunt non tantum maribus
inesse semen, verum etiam foeminis, et inde plerumque matribus similes procreari; sed
earum semensanguinem esse purgatum, quod si recte cum virili mixture sit, utraque concreta
et simul co-agulata informari: et primum quidem cor hominis effingi, quod in eo sit et vita
omnis et sapientia; denique totum opus quadragesimo die consummari. Ex abortionibus
hæ c fortasse collecta sunt. In avium tamen foetibus primurn oculos fingi dubium non est,
quod in ovis sæ pe deprehendimus. Unde fieri non posse arbitror quin fictio a capite sumat
exordium.</p>
<p>Similitudines autem in corporibus filiorum sic fieri putant. Cum semina inter se permixta
coalescunt, si virile superaverit, patri similem provenire, seu marem, seu foeminam; si
muliebre præ valuerit, progeniem cujusque sexus ad imaginem respondere maternam. Id
autem præ valet e duobus, quod fuerit uberius; alterum enim quodammodo amplectitur et
includit: hinc plerumque fled, ut unius tantum lineamenta præ tendat. Si vero æqua fuerit
ex pari semente permixtio, figuras quoque misceri, ut soboles illa communis aut neutrum
referre videatur, quia totum ex altero non habet; aut utrumque, quia partem de singulis
mutuata est. Nam in cor-poribus animalium videmus aut confundi parentum colores, ac
fieri tertium neutri generantium simile; aut utriusque sic exprimi, ut discoloribus membris
per omne corpus concors mixtura varietur. Dispares quoque naturæ hoc modo fieri putantur.
Cum forte in læ vam uteri partem masculinæ stirpis semen inciderit, marem quidem gigni
opinatio est; sed quia sit in foeminina parte conceptus, aliquid in se habere foemineum, supra
quam decus virile patiatur; vel formam insignem, vel nimium candorem, vel corporis

levitatem, vel artus delicatos, vel staturam brevem, vel vocem gracilem, vel animum
imbecillum, vel ex his plura. Item, si partem in dextram semen foeminini sexus influxerit,
foeminam quidem procreari; sed quoniam in masculina parte concepta sit, habere in se
aliquid virilita-tis, ultra quam sexus; ratio permittat; aut valida membra, aut immoderatam

ad conservationem generum singulorum, duos sexus maris ac foeminæ machinatus est;
quibus inter se per voluptatis illecebras copulatis, successiva soboles pareretur, ne omne

quo facilius ad patientiam jugi maritalis foeminæ cogerentur. Vir itaque nominatus est, quod
major in eo vis est, quire in foemina; et hinc virtus nomen accepit. Item mulier (ut Varro

partus appropinquare jam coepit, turgescentes mammæ dulcibus succis distenduntur, et ad

quam ut sapiens animal a corde alimoniam duceret. Idque ipsum solertissime comparatum
est, ut candens ac pinguis humor teneritudinem novi corporis irrigaret, donec ad capiendos

<p>How is it with respect to the other parts of the body? Are they without order and beauty?
The flesh rounded off into the nates, how adapted to the office of sitting! and this also more
firm than in the other limbs, lest by the pressure of the bulk of the body it should give way
to the bones. Also the length of the thighs drawn out, and strengthened by broader muscles,
in order that it might more easily sustain the weight of the body; and as this is gradually
contracted, it is bounded1903 by the knees, the comely joints1904 of which supply a bend
which is most adapted for walking and sitting. Also the legs not drawn out in an equal
manner, lest an unbecoming figure should deform the feet; but they are at once strengthened
and adorned by well-turned1905 calves gently standing out and gradually diminishing.</p>
<p>But in the soles of the feet there is the same plan as in the hands, but yet very different:
for since these are, as it were, the foundations of the whole body,1906 the admirable Artificer
has not made them of a round appearance, lest man should be unable to stand, or should
need other feet for standing, as is the case with quadrupeds; but He has formed them of a
longer and more extended shape, that they might make the body firm by their flatness,1907
from which circumstance their name was given to them. The toes are of the same number
with the fingers, for the sake of appearance rather than utility; and on this account they are
both joined together, and short, and put together by gradations; and that which is the greatest
of these, since it was not befitting that it should be separated from the others, as in the hand,
has been so arranged in order, that it appears to differ from the others in magnitude and
the small space which intervenes. This beautiful union1908 of them strengthens the pressure
of the feet with no slight aid; for we cannot be excited to running, unless, our toes being
pressed against the ground, and resting upon the soil, we take an impetus and a spring. I

<head>CHAP. XIV.—OF THE UNKNOWN PURPOSE OF SOME OF THE INTESTINES.</head>
<p>It is evident that there are many things in the body, the force and purpose of which no
one can perceive but He who made them. Can any one suppose that he is able to relate what
is the advantage, and what the effect, of that slight transparent membrane by which the
stomach is netted over and covered? What the twofold resemblance of the kidneys? which
Varro says are so named because streams of foul moisture arise from these; which is far
from being the case, because, rising on either side of the spine, they are united, and are
separated from the intestines. What is the use of the spleen? What of the liver? Organs which
appear as it were to be made up1909 of disordered blood. What of the very bitter moisture
of the gall? What of the heart? unless we shall happen to think that they ought to be believed,
who think that the affection of anger is placed in the gall, that of fear in the heart, of joy in
the spleen. But they will have it that the office of the liver is, by its embrace and heat, to digest
the food in the stomach; some think that the desires of the amorous passions are contained
in the liver.</p>
<p>First of all, the acuteness of the human sense is unable to perceive these things, because
their offices lie concealed; nor, when laid open, do they show their uses. For, if it were so,
perhaps the more gentle animals would either have no gall at all, or less than the wild beasts;
the more timid ones would have more heart, the more lustful would have more liver, the
more playful more spleen. As, therefore, we perceive that we hear with our ears, that we see
with our eyes, that we smell with our nostrils; so assuredly we should perceive that we are
angry with the gall, that we desire with the liver, that we rejoice with the spleen. Since,
therefore, we do not at all perceive from what part those affections come, it is possible that
they may come from another source, and that those organs may have a different effect to
that which we suppose. We cannot prove, however, that they who discuss these things speak
falsely. But I think that all things which relate to the motions of the mind and soul, are of
so obscure and profound a nature, that it is beyond the power of man to see through them
clearly. This, however, ought to be sure and undoubted, that so many objects and so many
organs have one and the same office—to retain the soul in the body. But what office is particularly
assigned to each, who can know, except the Designer, to whom alone His own work
is known?</p>

<head>CHAP. XV.—OF THE VOICE.</head>
<p>But what account can we give of the voice? Grammarians, indeed, and philosophers,
define the voice to be air struck by the breath; from which words1910 derive their name:
which is plainly false. For the voice is not produced outside of the mouth, but within, and
therefore that opinion is more probable, that the breath, being compressed, when it has
struck against the obstacle presented by the throat, forces out the sound of the voice: as
when we send down the breath into an open hemlock stalk, having applied it to the lips,
and the breath, reverberating from the hollow of the stalk, and rolled back from the bottom,
while it returns1911 to that descending through meeting with itself, striving for an outlet,
produces a sound; and the wind, rebounding by itself, is animated into vocal breath. Now,
whether this is true, God, who is the designer, may see. For the voice appears to arise not
from the mouth, but from the innermost breast. In fine, even when the mouth is closed, a
sound such as is possible is emitted from the nostrils. Moreover, also, the voice is not affected
by that greatest breath with which we gasp, but with a light and not compressed breath, as
often as we wish. It has not therefore been comprehended in what manner it takes place, or
what it is altogether. And do not imagine that I am now falling into the opinion of the
Academy, for all things are not incomprehensible. For as it must be confessed that many
things are unknown, since God has willed that they should exceed the understanding of
man; so, however, it must be acknowledged that there are many which may both be perceived
by the senses and comprehended by the reason. But we shall devote an entire treatise to the
refutation of the philosophers. Let us therefore finish the course over which we are now
running.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVI.—OF THE MIND AND ITS SEAT.</head>
<p>That the nature of the mind is also incomprehensible, who can be ignorant, but he who
is altogether destitute of mind, since it is not known in what place the mind is situated, or
of what nature it is? Therefore various things have been discussed by philosophers concerning
its nature and place. But I will not conceal what my own sentiments are: not that I should
affirm that it is so—for in a doubtful matter it is the part of a foolish person to do this; but
that when I have set forth the difficulty of the matter, you may understand how great is the
magnitude off the divine works. Some would have it, that the seat of the mind is in the breast.
But if this is so, how wonderful is it, that a faculty which is situated in an obscure and dark
habitation should be employed in so great a light of reason and intelligence; then that the
senses from every part of the body come together to it, so that it appears to be present in
any quarter of the limbs! Others have said that its seat is in the brain and, indeed, they have
used probable arguments, saying that it was doubtless befitting that that which had the
government of the whole body should especially have its abode in the highest place, as
though in the citadel of the body; and that nothing should be in a more elevated position
than that which governs the whole by reason, just as the Lord Himself, and Ruler of the
universe, is in the highest place. Then they say, that the organs which are the ministers of
each sense, that is, of hearing, and seeing, and smelling, are situated in the head, and that
the channels of all these lead not to the breast, but to the brain: otherwise we must be more
slow in the exercise of our senses, until the power of sensation by a long course should descend
through the neck even to the breast. These, in truth, do not greatly err, or perchance
not at all. For the mind, which exercises control over the body, appears to be placed in the
highest part, the head, as God is in heaven; but when it is engaged in any reflection, it appears
to pass to the breast, and, as it were, to withdraw to some secret recess, that it may elicit and
draw forth counsel, as it were, from a hidden treasury. And therefore, when we are intent
upon reflection, and when the mind, being occupied, has withdrawn itself to the inner
depth,1912 we are accustomed neither to hear the things which sound about us, nor to see
the things which stand in our way. But whether this is the case, it is assuredly a matter of
admiration how this takes place, since there is no passage from the brain to the breast. But
if it is not so, nevertheless it is no less a matter of admiration that, by some divine plan or
other, it is caused that it appears to be so. Can any fail to admire that that living and heavenly
faculty which is called the mind or the soul, is of such volubility1913 that it does not rest
even then when it is asleep; of such rapidity, that it surveys the whole heaven at one moment

of time; and, if it wills, flies over seas, traverses lands and cities,—in short, places in its own
sight all things which it pleases, however far and widely they are removed?</p>
<p>And does any one wonder if the divine mind of God, being extended1914 through all
parts of the universe, runs to and fro, and rules all things, governs all things, being everywhere
present, everywhere diffused; when the strength and power of the human mind, though
enclosed within a mortal body, is so great, that it can in no way be restrained even by the
barriers of this heavy and slothful body, to which it is bound, from bestowing upon itself,
in its impatience of rest, the power of wandering without restraint? Whether, therefore, the
mind has its dwelling in the head or in the breast, can any one comprehend what power of
reason effects, that that incomprehensible faculty either remains fixed in the marrow of the
brain, or in that blood divided into two parts1915 which is enclosed in the heart; and not
infer from this very circumstance how great is the power of God, because the soul does not
see itself, or of what nature or where it is; and if it did see, yet it would not be able to perceive
in what manner an incorporeal substance is united with one which is corporeal? Or if the
mind has no fixed locality, but runs here and there scattered through the whole body,—which
is possible, and was asserted by Xenocrates, the disciple of Plato,—then, inasmuch as intel-
ligence is present in every part of the body, it cannot be understood what that mind is, or
what its qualities are, since its nature is so subtle and refined, that, though infused into solid
organs by a living and, as it were, ardent perception, it is mingled with all the members.</p>
<p>But take care that you never think it probable, as Aristoxenus said, that the mind has
no existence, but that the power of perception exists from the constitution of the body and
the construction of the organs, as harmony does in the case of the lyre. For musicians call
the stretching and sounding of the strings to entire strains, without any striking of notes in
agreement with them, harmony. They will have it, therefore, that the soul in man exists in
a manner like that by which harmonious modulation exists on the lyre; namely, that the
firm uniting of the separate parts of the body and the vigour of all the limbs agreeing together,
makes that perceptible motion, and adjusts1916 the mind, as well-stretched things produce
harmonious sound. And as, in the lyre, when anything has been interrupted or relaxed, the
whole method of the strain is disturbed and destroyed; so in the body, when any part of the
limbs receives an injury, the whole are weakened, and all being corrupted and thrown into
confusion, the power of perception is destroyed: and this is called death. But he, if he had
possessed any mind, would never have transferred harmony from the lyre to man. For the
lyre cannot of its own accord send forth a sound, so that there can be in this any comparison
and resemblance to a living person; but the soul both reflects and is moved of its own accord.

But if there were in us anything resembling harmony, it would be moved by a blow from
without, as the strings of the lyre are by the hands; whereas without the handling of the artificer,
and the stroke of the fingers, they lie mute and motionless. But doubtless he1917
ought to have beaten by the hand, that he might at length observe; for his mind, badly
compacted from his members, was in a state of torpor.</p>

<pb n="681"/>
<head>CHAP. XVII.—OF THE SOUL, AND THE OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS
CONCERNING IT.</head>
<p>It remains to speak of the soul, although its system and nature cannot be perceived.
Nor, therefore, do we fail to understand that the soul is immortal, since whatever is vigorous
and is in motion by itself at all times, and cannot be seen or touched, must he eternal. But
what the soul is, is not yet agreed upon by philosophers, and perhaps will never be agreed
upon. For some have said that it is blood, others that it is fire, others wind, from which it
has received its name of anima, or animus, because in Greek the wind is called anemos1918
and yet none of these appears to have spoken anything. For if the soul appears to be extinguished
when the blood is poured forth through a wound, or is exhausted by the heat of
fevers, it does not therefore follow that the system of the soul is to be placed in the material
of the blood; as though a question should arise as to the nature of the light which we make
use of, and the answer should be given that it is oil, for when that is consumed the light is
extinguished: since they are plainly different, but the one is the nourishment of the other.
Therefore the soul appears to be like light, since it is not itself blood, but is nourished by
the moisture of the blood, as light is by oil.</p>
<p>But they who have supposed it to be fire made use of this argument, that when the soul
is present the body is warm, but on its departure the body grows cold. But fire is both without
perception and is seen, and burns when touched. But the soul is both endowed with perception
and cannot be seen, and does not burn. From which it is evident that the soul is something
like God. But they who suppose that it is wind are deceived by this, because we appear
to live by drawing breath from the air. Varro gives this definition: “The soul is air conceived
in the mouth, warmed in the lungs, heated in the heart, diffused into the body.” These things
are most plainly false. For I say that the nature of things of this kind is not so obscure, that
we do not even understand what cannot be true. If any one should say to me that the heaven
is of brass, or crystal, or, as Empedocles says, that it is frozen air, must I at once assent because
I do not know of what material the heaven is? For as I know not this, I know that. Therefore
the soul is not air conceived in the mouth, because the soul is produced much before air
can be conceived in the mouth. For it is not introduced into the body after birth, as it appears
to some philosophers, but immediately after conception, when the divine necessity has
formed the offspring in the womb; for it so lives within the bowels of its mother, that it is
increased in growth, and delights to bound with repeated beatings. In short, there must be
a miscarriage if the living young within shall die. The other parts of the definition have reference
to this, that during those nine months in which we were in the womb we appear to
have been dead. None, therefore, of these three opinions is true. We cannot, however, say
that they who held these sentiments were false to such an extent that they said nothing at
<note type="footnote">1918 ἄνεμος.</note>

<pb n="682"/>
all; for we live at once by the blood, and heat, and breath. But since the soul exists in the
body by the union of all these, they did not express what it was in its own proper sense;1919
for as it cannot be seen, so it cannot be expressed.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.—OF THE SOUL AND THE MIND, AND THEIR AFFECTIONS.</head>
<p>There follows another, and in itself an inexplicable inquiry: Whether the soul and the
mind are the same, or there be one faculty by which we live, and another by which we perceive
and have discernment.1920 There are not wanting arguments on either side. For they who
say that they are one faculty make use of this argument, that we cannot live without perception,
nor perceive without life, and therefore that that which is incapable of separation
cannot be different; but that whatever it is, it has the office of living and the method of perception.
On which account two1921 Epicurean poets speak of the mind and the soul indifferently.
But they who say that they are different argue in this way: That the mind is one
thing, and the soul another, may be understood from this, that the mind may be extinguished
while the soul is uninjured, which is accustomed to happen in the case of the insane; also,
that the soul is put to rest1922 by death, the mind by sleep, and indeed in such a manner
that it is not only ignorant of what is taking place,1923 or where it is, but it is even deceived
by the contemplation of false objects. And how this takes place cannot accurately be perceived;
why it takes place can be perceived. For we can by no means rest unless the mind is
kept occupied by the similitudes1924 of visions. But the mind lies hid, oppressed with sleep,
as fire buried1925 by ashes drawn over it; but if you stir it a little it again blazes, and, as it
were, wakes up.1926 Therefore it is called away by images,1927 until the limbs, bedewed with
sleep, are invigorated; for the body while the perception is awake, although it lies motionless,
yet is not at rest, because the perception burns in it, and vibrates as a flame, and keeps all
the limbs bound to itself.</p>
<p>But when the mind is transferred from its application to the contemplation of images,
then at length the whole body is resolved into rest. But the mind is transferred from dark
thought, when, under the influence of darkness, it has begun to be alone with itself. While
it is intent upon those things concerning which it is reflecting, sleep suddenly creeps on,
and the thought itself imperceptibly turns aside to the nearest appearances:1928 thus it begins
also to see those things which it had placed before its eyes. Then it proceeds further, and

finds diversions1929 for itself, that it may not interrupt the most healthy repose of the body.
For as the mind is diverted in the day by true sights, so that it does not sleep; so is it diverted
in the night by false sights, so that it is not aroused. For if it perceives no images, it will follow
of necessity either that it is awake, or that it is asleep in perpetual death. Therefore the system
of dreaming has been given by God for the sake of sleeping; and, indeed, it has been given
to all animals in common; but this especially to man, that when God gave this system on
account of rest, He left to Himself the power of teaching man future events by means of the
dream.1930 For narratives often testify that there have been dreams which have had an immediate
and a remarkable accomplishment,1931 and the answers of our prophets have been
after the character of a dream.1932 On which account they are not always true, nor always
false, as Virgil testified,1933 who supposed that there were two gates for the passage of dreams.
But those which are false are seen for the sake of sleeping; those which are true are sent by
God, that by this revelation we may learn impending goods or evils.</p>

<head>CHAP. XIX.—OF THE SOUL, AND IT GIVEN BY GOD.</head>
<p>A question also may arise respecting this, whether the soul is produced from the father,
or rather from the mother, or indeed from both. But I think that this judgment is to be
formed as though in a doubtful matter.1934 For nothing is true of these three opinions, because
souls are produced neither from both nor from either. For a body may be produced
from a body, since something is contributed from both; but a soul cannot be produced from
souls, because nothing can depart from a slight and incomprehensible subject. Therefore
the manner of the production of souls belongs entirely to God alone.
<lg>
<l>“In fine, we are all sprung from a heavenly seed, all have that same Father.”</l>
</lg>
as Lucretius1935 says. For nothing but what is mortal can be generated from mortals. Nor
ought he to be deemed a father who in no way perceives that he has transmitted or breathed
a soul from his own; nor, if he perceives it, comprehends in his mind when or in what
manner that effect is produced.</p>
<p>From this it is evident that souls are not given by parents, but by one and the same God
and Father of all, who alone has the law and method of their birth, since He alone produces
them. For the part of the earthly parent is nothing more than with a sense of pleasure to
emit the moisture of the body, in which is the material of birth, or to receive it; and to this
work man’s power is limited,1936 nor has he any further power. Therefore men wish for the
birth of sons, because they do not themselves bring it about. Everything beyond this is the
work of God,—namely, the conception itself, and the moulding of the body, and the
breathing in of life, and the bringing forth in safety, and whatever afterwards contributes
to the preservation of man: it is His gift that we breathe, that we live, and are vigorous. For,
besides that we owe it to His bounty that we are safe in body, and that He supplies us with
nourishment from various sources, He also gives to man wisdom, which no earthly father
can by any means give; and therefore it often happens that foolish sons are born from wise
parents, and wise sons from foolish parents, which some persons attribute to fate and the
stars. But this is not now the time to discuss the subject of fate. It is sufficient to say this,
that even if the stars hold together the efficacy of all things, it is nevertheless certain that all
things are done by God, who both made and set in order the stars themselves. They are
therefore senseless who detract this power from God, and assign it to His work.</p>
<p>He would have it, therefore, to be in our own power, whether we use or do not use this
divine and excellent gift of God. For, having granted this, He bound man himself by the

<pb n="686"/>
mystery1937 of virtue, by which he might be able to gain life. For great is the power, great
the reason, great the mysterious purpose of man; and if any one shall not abandon this, nor
betray his fidelity and devotedness, he must be happy: he, in short, to sum up the matter in
few words, must of necessity resemble God. For he is in error whosoever judges of1938 man
by his flesh. For this worthless body1939 with which we are clothed is the receptacle of
man.1940 For man himself, can neither be touched, nor looked upon, nor grasped, because
he lies hidden within this body, which is seen. And if he shall be more luxurious and delicate
in this life than its nature demands, if he shall despise virtue, and give himself to the pursuit
of fleshly lusts, he will fall and be pressed down to the earth; but if (as his duty is) he shall
readily and constantly maintain his position, which is right for him, and he has rightly obtained,
1941—if he shall not be enslaved to the earth, which he ought to trample upon and
overcome, he will gain eternal life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XX.—OF HIMSELF AND THE TRUTH.</head>
<p>These things I have written to you, Demetrianus, for the present in few words, and
perhaps with more obscurity than was befitting, in accordance with the necessity of circumstances
and the time, with which you ought to be content, since you are about to receive
more and better things if God shall favour us. Then, accordingly, I will exhort you with
greater clearness and truth to the learning of true philosophy. For I have determined to
commit to writing as many things as I shall be able, which have reference to the condition
of a happy life; and that indeed against the philosophers, since they are pernicious and
weighty for the disturbing of the truth. For the force of their eloquence is incredible, and
their subtlety in argument and disputation may easily deceive any one; and these we will
refute partly by our own weapons, but partly by weapons borrowed from their mutual
wrangling, so that it may be evident that they rather introduced error than removed it.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may wonder that I venture to undertake so great a deed. Shall we then
suffer the truth to be extinguished or crushed? I, in truth, would more willingly fail even
under this burthen. For if Marcus Tullius, the unparalleled example of eloquence itself, was
often vanquished by men void of learning and eloquence,—who, however, were striving for
that which was true,—why should we despair that the truth itself will by its own peculiar
force and clearness avail against deceitful and captious eloquence? They indeed are wont
to profess themselves advocates of the truth; but who can defend that which he has not
learned, or make clear to others that which he himself does not know? I seem to promise a
great thing; but there is need of the favour of Heaven, that ability and time may be given us
for following our purpose. But if life is to be wished for by a wise man, assuredly I should
wish to live for no other reason than that I may effect something which may be worthy of
life, and which may be useful to my readers, if not for eloquence, because there is in me but
a slight stream of eloquence, at any rate for living, which is especially needful. And when I
have accomplished this, I shall think that I have lived enough, and that I have discharged
the duty of a man, if my labour shall have freed some men from errors, and have directed
them to the path which leads to heaven.</p>

<head>GENERAL NOTE BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR.</head>
<p>Just here I economize a little spare room to note the cynical Gibbon’s ideas about
Lactantius and his works. He quotes him freely, and recognises his Ciceronian Latinity, and
even the elegance of his rhetoric, and the spirit and eloquence with which he can garnish
the “dismal tale” of coming judgments, based on the Apocalypse. But then, again1942 he
speaks of him as an “obscure rhetorician,” and affects a doubt as to his sources of information,
notably in doubting the conversation between Galerius and Diocletian which forced the
latter to abdicate. This is before he decides to attribute the work on the Deaths of Persecutors
to somebody else, or, rather, to quote its author ambiguously as Cæcilius. And here we may
insert what he says on this subject, as follows:—</p>
<p>“It is certain that this…was composed and published while Licinius, sovereign of the
East, still preserved the friendship of Constantine and of the Christians. Every reader of
taste must perceive that the style is of a very different and inferior character to that of
Lactantius; and such, indeed, is the judgment of Le Clerc1943 and Lardner.1944 Three arguments
(from the title of the book and from the names of Donatus and Cæcilius) are produced
by the advocates of Lactantius.1945 Each of these proofs is, singly, weak and defective; but
their concurrence has great weight. I have often fluctuated, and shall tamely1946 follow the
Colbert ms. in calling the author, whoever he was, Cæcilius.”</p>
<p>After this the critic adheres to this ambiguity. I have no wish to argue otherwise. Quite
as important are his notes on the Institutes. He states the probable conjecture of two original
editions,—the one under Diocletian, and the other under Licinius. Then he says:1947—</p>
<p>“I am almost convinced that Lactantius dedicated his Institutions to the sovereign of
Gaul at a time when Galerius, Maximin, and even Licinius, persecuted the Christians; that
is, between the years a.d. 306 and a.d. 311.”
<lg>
<l>On the dubious passages1948 he remarks:1949—</l>

<p>“The first and most important of these is, indeed, wanting in twenty-eight mss., but is
found in nineteen. If we weigh the comparative value of those mss., one, … in the King of

<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<p>The Lord has heard those supplications which you, my best beloved Donatus,1955 pour
forth in His presence all the day long, and the supplications of the rest of our brethren, who
by a glorious confession have obtained an everlasting crown, the reward of their faith. Behold,
all the adversaries are destroyed, and tranquillity having been re-established throughout
the Roman empire, the late oppressed Church arises again, and the temple of God, overthrown
by the hands of the wicked, is built with more glory than before. For God has raised
up princes to rescind the impious and sanguinary edicts of the tyrants and provide for the
welfare of mankind; so that now the cloud of past times is dispelled, and peace and serenity
gladden all hearts. And after the furious whirlwind and black tempest, the heavens are now
become calm, and the wished-for light has shone forth; and now God, the hearer of prayer,
by His divine aid has lifted His prostrate and afflicted servants from the ground, has brought
to an end the united devices of the wicked, and wiped off the tears from the faces of those
who mourned. They who insulted over the Divinity, lie low; they who cast down the holy
temple, are fallen with more tremendous ruin; and the tormentors of just men have poured
out their guilty souls amidst plagues inflicted by Heaven, and amidst deserved tortures. For
God delayed to punish them, that, by great and marvellous examples, He might teach posterity
that He alone is God, and that with fit vengeance He executes judgment on the proud,
the impious, and the persecutors.1956</p>
<p>Of the end of those men I have thought good to publish a narrative, that all who are
afar off, and all who shall arise hereafter, may learn how the Almighty manifested His power
and sovereign greatness in rooting out and utterly destroying the enemies of His name. And
this will become evident, when I relate who were the persecutors of the Church from the
time of its first constitution, and what were the punishments by which the divine Judge, in
His severity, took vengeance on them.</p>

<p>In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius Geminus and
Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April,1957 as I find it written, Jesus Christ
was crucified by the Jews.1958 After He had risen again on the third day, He gathered together
His apostles, whom fear, at the time of His being laid hold on, had put to flight; and while
He sojourned with them forty days, He opened their hearts, interpreted to them the Scripture,
which hitherto had been wrapped up in obscurity, ordained and fitted them for the
preaching of His word and doctrine, and regulated all things concerning the institutions of
the New Testament; and this having been accomplished, a cloud and whirlwind enveloped
Him, and caught Him up from the sight of men unto heaven.</p>
<p>His apostles were at that time eleven in number, to whom were added Matthias, in the
room of the traitor Judas, and afterwards Paul. Then were they dispersed throughout all the
earth to preach the Gospel, as the Lord their Master had commanded them; and during
twenty-five years, and until the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Nero, they occupied
themselves in laying the foundations of the Church in every province and city. And while
Nero reigned, the Apostle Peter came to Rome, and, through the power of God committed
unto him, wrought certain miracles, and, by turning many to the true religion, built up a
faithful and stedfast temple unto the Lord. When Nero heard of those things, and observed
that not only in Rome, but in every other place, a great multitude revolted daily from the
worship of idols, and, condemning their old ways, went over to the new religion, he, an execrable
and pernicious tyrant, sprung forward to raze the heavenly temple and destroy the
true faith. He it was who first persecuted the servants of God; he crucified Peter, and slew
Paul:1959 nor did he escape with impunity; for God looked on the affliction of His people;
and therefore the tyrant, bereaved of authority, and precipitated from the height of empire,
suddenly disappeared, and even the burial-place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to
be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been
conveyed to a distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the Sibylline
verses concerning
<lg>
<l>“The fugitive, who slew his own mother, being to come from the uttermost
boundaries of the earth;”</l>
</lg>
as if he who was the first should also be the last persecutor, and thus prove the forerunner
of Antichrist! But we ought not to believe those who, affirming that the two prophets Enoch

<head>CHAP. III.</head>
<p>After an interval of some years from the death of Nero, there arose another tyrant no
less wicked (Domitian), who, although his government was exceedingly odious, for a very
long time oppressed his subjects, and reigned in security, until at length he stretched forth
his impious hands against the Lord. Having been instigated by evil demons to persecute the
righteous people, he was then delivered into the power of his enemies, and suffered due
punishment. To be murdered in his own palace was not vengeance ample enough: the very
memory of his name was erased. For although he had erected many admirable edifices, and
rebuilt the Capitol, and left other distinguished marks of his magnificence, yet the senate
did so persecute his name, as to leave no remains of his statues, or traces of the inscriptions
put up in honour of him; and by most solemn and severe decrees it branded him, even after
death, with perpetual infamy. Thus, the commands of the tyrant having been rescinded, the
Church was not only restored to her former state, but she shone forth with additional
splendour, and became more and more flourishing. And in the times that followed, while
many well-deserving princes guided the helm of the Roman empire, the Church suffered
no violent assaults from her enemies, and she extended her hands unto the east and unto
the west, insomuch that now there was not any the most remote corner of the earth to which
the divine religion had not penetrated, or any nation of manners so barbarous that did not,
by being converted to the worship of God, become mild and gentle.1961</p>

<p>This long peace,1962 however, was afterwards interrupted. Decius appeared in the world,
an accursed wild beast, to afflict the Church,—and who but a bad man would persecute religion?
It seems as if he had been raised to sovereign eminence, at once to rage against God,
and at once to fall; for, having undertaken an expedition against the Carpi, who had then
possessed themselves of Dacia and Moefia, he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians,
and slain, together with great part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the rites of
sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by wild beasts and birds,1963—a
fit end for the enemy of God.</p>

<p>And presently Valerian also, in a mood alike frantic, lifted up his impious hands to assault
God, and, although his time was short, shed much righteous blood. But God punished him
in a new and extraordinary manner, that it might be a lesson to future ages that the adversaries
of Heaven always receive the just recompense of their iniquities. He, having been made
prisoner by the Persians, lost not only that power which he had exercised without moderation,
but also the liberty of which be had deprived others; and he wasted the remainder of his
days in the vilest condition of slavery: for Sapores, the king of the Persians, who had made
him prisoner, whenever he chose to get into his carriage or to mount on horseback, commanded
the Roman to stoop and present his back; then, setting his foot on the shoulders
of Valerian, he said, with a smile of reproach, “This is true, and not what the Romans delineate
on board or plaster.” Valerian lived for a considerable time under the well-merited insults
of his conqueror; so that the Roman name remained long the scoff and derision of the barbarians:
and this also was added to the severity of his punishment, that although he had an
emperor for his son, he found no one to revenge his captivity and most abject and servile
state; neither indeed was he ever demanded back. Afterward, when he had finished this
shameful life under so great dishonour, he was flayed, and his skin, stripped from the flesh,
was dyed with vermilion, and placed in the temple of the gods of the barbarians, that the
remembrance of a triumph so signal might be perpetuated, and that this spectacle might
always be exhibited to our ambassadors, as an admonition to the Romans, that, beholding
the spoils of their captived emperor in a Persian temple, they should not place too great
confidence in their own strength.</p>
<p>Now since God so punished the sacrilegious, is it not strange that any one should afterward
have dared to do, or even to devise, aught against the majesty of the one God, who
governs and supports all things?</p>

<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<p>Aurelian might have recollected the fate of the captived emperor, yet, being of a nature
outrageous and headstrong, he forgot both his sin and its punishment, and by deeds of
cruelty irritated the divine wrath. He was not, however, permitted to accomplish what he
had devised; for just as he began to give a loose to his rage, he was slain. His bloody edicts
had not yet reached the more distant provinces, when he himself lay all bloody on the earth
at Cænophrurium in Thrace, assassinated by his familiar friends, who had taken up
groundless suspicions against him.</p>
<p>Examples of such a nature, and so numerous, ought to have deterred succeeding tyrants;
nevertheless they were not only not dismayed, but, in their misdeeds against God, became
more bold and presumptuous.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="698"/>
<head>CHAP. VII.</head>
<p>While Diocletian, that author of ill, and deviser of misery, was ruining all things, he
could not withhold his insults, not even against God. This man, by avarice partly, and partly
by timid counsels, overturned the Roman empire. For he made choice of three persons to
share the government with him; and thus, the empire having been quartered, armies were
multiplied, and each of the four princes strove to maintain a much more considerable military
force than any sole emperor had done in times past.1964 There began to be fewer men
who paid taxes than there were who received wages; so that the means of the husbandmen
being exhausted by enormous impositions, the farms were abandoned, cultivated grounds
became woodland, and universal dismay prevailed. Besides, the provinces were divided into
minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each
territory, and almost on each city. There were also many stewards of different degrees, and
deputies of presidents. Very few civil causes came before them: but there were condemnations
daily, and forfeitures frequently inflicted; taxes on numberless commodities, and those not
only often repeated, but perpetual, and, in exacting them, intolerable wrongs.</p>
<p>Whatever was laid on for the maintenance of the soldiery might have been endured;
but Diocletian, through his insatiable avarice, would never allow the sums of money in his
treasury to be diminished: he was constantly heaping together extraordinary aids and free
gifts, that his original hoards might remain untouched and inviolable. He also, when by
various extortions he had made all things exceedingly dear, attempted by an ordinance to
limit their prices. Then much blood was shed for the veriest trifles; men were afraid to expose
aught to sale, and the scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever, until, in the
end, the ordinance, after having proved destructive to multitudes, was from mere necessity
abrogated. To this there were added a certain endless passion for building, and on that account,
endless exactions from the provinces for furnishing wages to labourers and artificers,
and supplying carriages and whatever else was requisite to the works which he projected.
Here public halls, there a circus, here a mint, and there a workhouse for making implements
of war; in one place a habitation for his empress, and in another for his daughter. Presently
great part of the city was quitted, and all men removed with their wives and children, as
from a town taken by enemies; and when those buildings were completed, to the destruction
of whole provinces, he said, “They are not right, let them be done on another plan.” Then
they were to be pulled down, or altered, to undergo perhaps a future demolition. By such
folly was he continually endeavouring to equal Nicomedia with the city Rome in magnificence.</p>
<p>I omit mentioning how many perished on account of their possessions or wealth; for
such evils were exceedingly frequent, and through their frequency appeared almost lawful.
<note type="footnote">1964 [See p. 12, note 1, supra.]</note>

<pb n="699"/>
But this was peculiar to him, that whenever he saw a field remarkably well cultivated, or a
house of uncommon elegance, a false accusation and a capital punishment were straightway
prepared against the proprietor; so that it seemed as if Diocletian could not be guilty of
rapine without also shedding blood.</p>

<head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
<p>What was the character of his brother in empire, Maximian, called Herculius? Not unlike
to that of Diocletian; and, indeed, to render their friendship so close and faithful as it was,
there must have been in them a sameness of inclinations and purposes, a corresponding
will and unanimity in judgment. Herein alone they were different, that Diocletian was more
avaricious and less resolute, and that Maximian, with less avarice, had a bolder spirit, prone
not to good, but to evil. For while he possessed Italy, itself the chief seat of empire, and while
other very opulent provinces, such as Africa and Spain, were near at hand, he took little care
to preserve those treasures which he had such fair opportunities of amassing. Whenever he
stood in need of more, the richest senators were presently charged, by suborned evidences,
as guilty of aspiring to the empire; so that the chief luminaries of the senate were daily extinguished.
And thus the treasury, delighting in blood, overflowed with ill-gotten wealth.</p>
<p>Add to all this the incontinency of that pestilent wretch, not only in debauching males,
which is hateful and abominable, but also in the violation of the daughters of the principal
men of the state; for wherever he journeyed, virgins were suddenly torn from the presence
of their parents. In such enormities he placed his supreme delight, and to indulge to the
utmost his lust and flagitious desires was in his judgment the felicity of his reign.</p>

government of the empire.</p>

<p>But the other Maximian (Galerius), chosen by Diocletian for his son-in-law, was worse,
not only than those two princes whom our own times have experienced, but worse than all
the bad princes of former days. In this wild beast there dwelt a native barbarity and a savageness
foreign to Roman blood; and no wonder, for his mother was born beyond the Danube,
and it was an inroad of the Carpi that obliged her to cross over and take refuge in New Dacia.
The form of Galerius corresponded with his manners. Of stature tall, full of flesh, and swollen
to a horrible bulk of corpulency; by his speech, gestures, and looks, he made himself a terror
to all that came near him. His father-in-law, too, dreaded him excessively. The cause was
this. Narseus, king of the Persians, emulating the example set him by his grandfather Sapores,
assembled a great army, and aimed at becoming master of the eastern provinces of the Roman
empire. Diocletian, apt to be low-spirited and timorous in every commotion, and fearing a
fate like that of Valerian, would not in person encounter Narseus; but he sent Galerius by
the way of Armenia, while he himself halted in the eastern provinces, and anxiously watched
the event. It is a custom amongst the barbarians to take everything that belongs to them
into the field. Galerius laid an ambush for them, and easily overthrew men embarrassed
with the multitude of their followers and with their baggage. Having put Narseus to flight,
and returned with much spoil, his own pride and Diocletian’s fears were greatly increased.
For after this victory he rose to such a pitch of haughtiness as to reject the appellation of
Cæsar;1965 and when he heard that appellation in letters addressed to him, he cried out,
with a stern look and terrible voice, “How long am I to be Cæsar? “Then he began to act
extravagantly, insomuch that, as if he had been a second Romulus, he wished to pass for
and to be called the offspring of Mars; and that he might appear the issue of a divinity, he
was willing that his mother Romula should be dishonoured with the name of adulteress.
But, not to confound the chronological order of events, I delay the recital of his actions; for
indeed afterwards, when Galerius got the title of emperor, his father-in-law having been
divested of the imperial purple, he became altogether outrageous, and of unbounded arrogance.</p>
<p>While by such a conduct, and with such associates, Diocles—for that was the name of
Diocletian before he attained sovereignty—occupied himself in subverting the commonweal,
there was no evil which his crimes did not deserve: nevertheless he reigned most prosperously,
as long as he forbore to defile his hands with the blood of the just; and what cause he had
for persecuting them, I come now to explain.</p>

<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<p>Diocletian, as being of a timorous disposition, was a searcher into futurity, and during
his abode in the East he began to slay victims, that from their livers he might obtain a prognostic
of events; and while he sacrificed, some attendants of his, who were Christians, stood
by, and they put the immortal sign on their foreheads. At this the demons were chased away,
and the holy rites interrupted. The soothsayers trembled, unable to investigate the wonted
marks on the entrails of the victims. They frequently repeated the sacrifices, as if the former
had been unpropitious; but the victims, slain from time to time, afforded no tokens for
divination. At length Tages, the chief of the soothsayers,1966 either from guess or from his
own observation, said, “There are profane persons here, who obstruct the rites.” Then
Diocletian, in furious passion, ordered not only all who were assisting at the holy ceremonies,
but also all who resided within the palace, to sacrifice, and, in case of their refusal, to be
scourged. And further, by letters to the commanding officers, he enjoined that all soldiers
should be forced to the like impiety, under pain of being dismissed the service. Thus far his
rage proceeded; but at that season he did nothing more against the law and religion of God.
After an interval of some time he went to winter in Bithynia; and presently Galerius Cæsar
came thither, inflamed with furious resentment, and purposing to excite the inconsiderate
old man to carry on that persecution which he had begun against the Christians. I have
learned that the cause of his fury was as follows.</p>
<note type="footnote">1966 [Nothing easier than for these to pretend such a difficulty, in order to incite the emperor to severities.

<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<p>The mother of Galerius, a woman exceedingly superstitious, was a votary of the gods
of the mountains. Being of such a character, she made sacrifices almost every day, and she
feasted her servants on the meat offered to idols: but the Christians of her family would not
partake of those entertainments; and while she feasted with the Gentiles, they continued in
fasting and prayer. On this account she conceived ill-will against the Christians, and by
woman-like complaints instigated her son, no less superstitious than herself, to destroy
them. So, during the whole winter, Diocletian and Galerius held councils together, at which
no one else assisted; and it was the universal opinion that their conferences respected the
most momentous affairs of the empire. The old man long opposed the fury of Galerius, and
showed how pernicious it would be to raise disturbances throughout the world and to shed
so much blood; that the Christians were wont with eagerness to meet death; and that it
would be enough for him to exclude persons of that religion from the court1967 and the
army. Yet he could not restrain the madness of that obstinate man. He resolved, therefore,
to take the opinion of his friends. Now this was a circumstance in the bad disposition of
Diocletian, that whenever he determined to do good, he did it without advice, that the praise
might be all his own; but whenever he determined to do ill, which he was sensible would be
blamed, he called in many advisers, that his own fault might be imputed to other men: and
therefore a few civil magistrates, and a few military commanders, were admitted to give
their counsel; and the question was put to them according to priority of rank. Some, through
personal ill-will towards the Christians, were of opinion that they ought to be cut off, as
enemies of the gods and adversaries of the established religious ceremonies. Others thought
differently, but, having understood the will of Galerius, they, either from dread of displeasing
or from a desire of gratifying him, concurred in the opinion given against the Christians.
Yet not even then could the emperor be prevailed upon to yield his assent. He determined
above all to consult his gods; and to that end he despatched a soothsayer to inquire of Apollo
at Miletus, whose answer was such as might be expected from an enemy of the divine religion.
So Diocletian was drawn over from his purpose. But although he could struggle no longer
against his friends, and against Cæsar and Apollo, yet still he attempted to observe such
moderation as to command the business to be carried through without bloodshed; whereas
Galerius would have had all persons burnt alive who refused to sacrifice.</p>

<p>A fit and auspicious day was sought out for the accomplishment of this undertaking;
and the festival of the god Terminus, celebrated on the sevens of the kalends of March,1968
was chosen, in preference to all others, to terminate, as it were, the Christian religion.
<lg>
<l>“That day, the harbinger of death, arose,</l>
<l>First cause of ill, and long enduring woes;”</l>
</lg>
of woes which befell not only the Christians, but the whole earth. When that day dawned,
in the eighth consulship of Diocletian and seventh of Maximian, suddenly, while it was yet
hardly light, the prefect, together with chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the
treasury, came to the church in Nicomedia, and the gates having been forced open, they
searched everywhere for an image of the Divinity. The books of the Holy Scriptures were
found, and they were committed to the flames; the utensils and furniture of the church were
abandoned to pillage: all was rapine, confusion, tumult. That church, situated on rising
ground, was within view of the palace; and Diocletian and Galerius stood, as if on a watchtower,
disputing long whether it ought to be set on fire. The sentiment of Diocletian prevailed,
who dreaded lest, so great a fire being once kindled, some part of the city might he burnt;
for there were many and large buildings that surrounded the church. Then the Pretorian
Guards came in battle array, with axes and other iron instruments, and having been let loose
everywhere, they in a few hours levelled that very lofty edifice with the ground.1969</p>

<p>Next day an edict was published, depriving the Christians of all honours and dignities;
ordaining also that, without any distinction of rank or degree, they should be subjected to
tortures, and that every suit at law should be received against them; while, on the other
hand, they were debarred from being plaintiffs in questions of wrong, adultery, or theft;
and, finally, that they should neither be capable of freedom, nor have right of suffrage. A
certain person tore down this edict, and cut it in pieces, improperly indeed, but with high
spirit, saying in scorn, “These are the triumphs of Goths and Sarmatians.” Having been instantly
seized and brought to judgment, he was not only tortured, but burnt alive, in the
forms of law; and having displayed admirable patience under sufferings, he was consumed
to ashes.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="706"/>
<head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
<p>But Galerius, not satisfied with the tenor of the edict, sought in another way to gain on
the emperor. That he might urge him to excess of cruelty in persecution, he employed private
emissaries to set the palace on fire; and some part of it having been burnt, the blame was
laid on the Christians as public enemies; and the very appellation of Christian grew odious1970
on account of that fire. It was said that the Christians, in concert with the eunuchs, had
plotted to destroy the princes; and that both of the princes had well-nigh been burnt alive
in their own palace. Diocletian, shrewd and intelligent as he always chose to appear, suspected
nothing of the contrivance, but, inflamed with anger, immediately commanded that all his
own domestics should be tortured to force a confession of the plot. He sat on his tribunal,
and saw innocent men tormented by fire to make discovery. All magistrates, and all who
had superintendency in the imperial palace, obtained special commissions to administer
the torture; and they strove with each other who should be first in bringing to light the
conspiracy. No circumstances, however, of the fact were detected anywhere; for no one applied
the torture to any domestics of Galerius. He himself was ever with Diocletian, constantly
urging him, and never allowing the passions of the inconsiderate old man to cool. Then,
after an interval of fifteen days, he attempted a second fire; but that was perceived quickly,
and extinguished. Still, however, its author remained unknown. On that very day, Galerius,
who in the middle of winter had prepared for his departure, suddenly hurried out of the
city, protesting that he fled to escape being burnt alive.</p>
<note type="footnote">1970 [That it had become in some degree popular, see evidence, vol. vi. pp. 158–160.]</note>

<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<p>And now Diocletian raged, not only against his own domestics, but indiscriminately
against all; and he began by forcing his daughter Valeria and his wife Prisca to be polluted
by sacrificing. Eunuchs, once the most powerful, and who had chief authority at court and
with the emperor, were slain. Presbyters and other officers of the Church were seized, without
evidence by witnesses or confession, condemned, and together with their families led to
execution. In burning alive, no distinction of sex or age was regarded; and because of their
great multitude, they were not burnt one after another, but a herd of them were encircled
with the same fire; and servants, having millstones tied about their necks, were cast into the
sea. Nor was the persecution less grievous on the rest of the people of God; for the judges,
dispersed through all the temples, sought to compel every one to sacrifice. The prisons were
crowded; tortures, hitherto unheard of, were invented; and lest justice should be inadvertently
administered to a Christian, altars were placed in the courts of justice, hard by the tribunal,
that every litigant might offer incense before his cause could be heard. Thus judges were no
otherwise approached than divinities. Mandates also had gone to Maximian Herculius and
Constantius, requiring their concurrence in the execution of the edicts; for in matters even
of such mighty importance their opinion was never once asked. Herculius, a person of no
merciful temper, yielded ready obedience, and enforced the edicts throughout his dominions
of Italy. Constantius, on the other hand, lest he should have seemed to dissent from the injunctions
of his superiors, permitted the demolition of churches,—mere walls, and capable
of being built up again,—but he preserved entire that true temple of God, which is the human
body.1971</p>

<p>Thus was all the earth afflicted; and from east to west, except in the territories of Gaul,
three ravenous wild beasts continued to rage.

<l>A voice of brass, and adamantine lungs,</l>
<l>Not half the dreadful scene could I disclose,”</l>
</lg>
or recount the punishments inflicted by the rulers in every province on religious and innocent
men.</p>
<p>But what need of a particular recital of those things, especially to you, my best beloved
Donatus,1972 who above all others was exposed to the storm of that violent persecution?
For when you had fallen into the hands of the prefect Flaccinian, no puny murderer, and
afterwards of Hierocles, who from a deputy became president of Bithynia, the author and
adviser of the persecution, and last of all into the hands of his successor Priscillian, you
displayed to mankind a pattern of invincible magnanimity. Having been nine times exposed
to racks and diversified torments, nine times by a glorious profession of your faith you foiled
the adversary; in nine combats you subdued the devil and his chosen soldiers; and by nine
victories you triumphed over this world and its terrors. How pleasing the spectacle to God,
when He beheld you a conqueror, yoking in your chariot not white horses, nor enormous
elephants, but those very men who had led captive the nations! After this sort to lord it over
the lords of the earth is triumph indeed! Now, by your valour were they conquered, when
you set at defiance their flagitious edicts, and, through stedfast faith and the fortitude of
your soul, you routed all the vain terrors of tyrannical authority. Against you neither scourges,
nor iron claws, nor fire, nor sword, nor various kinds of torture, availed aught; and no violence
could bereave you of your fidelity and persevering resolution. This it is to be a disciple
of God, and this it is to be a soldier of Christ; a soldier whom no enemy can dislodge, or
wolf snatch, from the heavenly camp; no artifice ensnare, or pain of body subdue, or torments
overthrow. At length, after those nine glorious combats, in which the devil was vanquished
by you, he dared not to enter the lists again with one whom, by repeated trials, he had found
unconquerable; and he abstained from challenging you any more, lest you should have laid
hold on the garland of victory already stretched out to you; an unfading garland, which, although
you have not at present received it, is laid up in the kingdom of the Lord for your
virtue and deserts. But let us now return to the course of our narrative.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
<p>The wicked plan having been carried into execution, Diocletian, whom prosperity had
now abandoned, set out instantly for Rome, there to celebrate the commencement of the
twentieth year of his reign. That solemnity was performed on the twelfth of the kalends of
December;1973 and suddenly the emperor, unable to bear the Roman freedom of speech,
peevishly and impatiently burst away from the city. The kalends of January1974 approached,
at which day the consulship, for the ninth time, was to be offered to him; yet, rather than
continue thirteen days longer in Rome, he chose that his first appearance as consul should
be at Ravenna. Having, however, begun his journey in winter, amidst intense cold and incessant
rains, he contracted a slight but lingering disease: it harassed him without intermission,
so that he was obliged for the most part to be carried in a litter. Then, at the close of
summer, he made a circuit along the banks of the Danube, and so came to Nicomedia. His
disease had now become more grievous and oppressing; yet he caused himself to be brought
out, in order to dedicate that circus which, at the conclusion of the twentieth year of his
reign, he had erected. Immediately he grew so languid and feeble, that prayers for his life
were put up to all the gods. Then suddenly, on the ides of December,1975 there was heard
in the palace sorrow, and weeping, and lamentation, and the courtiers ran to and fro; there
was silence throughout the city, and a report went of the death, and even of the burial, of
Diocletian: but early on the morrow it was suddenly rumoured that he still lived. At this the
countenance of his domestics and courtiers changed from melancholy to gay. Nevertheless
there were who suspected his death to be kept secret until the arrival of Galerius Cæsar, lest
in the meanwhile the soldiery should attempt some change in the government; and this
suspicion grew so universal, that no one would believe the emperor alive, until, on the
kalends of March,1976 he appeared in public, but so wan, his illness having lasted almost a
year, as hardly to be known again. The fit of stupor, resembling death, happened on the ides
of December; and although he in some measure recovered, yet he never attained to perfect
health again, for he became disordered in his judgment, being at certain times insane and
at others of sound mind.</p>

<head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
<p>Within a few days Galerius Cæsar arrived, not to congratulate his father-in-law on the
re-establishment of his health, but to force him to resign the empire. Already he had urged
Maximian Herculius to the like purpose, and by the alarm of civil wars terrified the old man
into compliance; and he now assailed Diocletian. At first, in gentle and friendly terms, he
said that age and growing infirmities disabled Diocletian for the charge of the commonweal,
and that he had need to give himself some repose after his labours. Galerius, in confirmation
of his argument, produced the example of Nerva, who laid the weight of empire on Trajan.</p>
<p>But Diocletian made answer, that it was unfit for one who had held a rank, eminent
above all others and conspicuous, to sink into the obscurity of a low station; neither indeed
was it safe, because in the course of so long a reign he must unavoidably have made many
enemies. That the case of Nerva was very different: he, after having reigned a single year,
felt himself, either from age or from inexperience in business, unequal to affairs so momentous,
and therefore threw aside the helm of government, and returned to that private life in
which he had already grown old. But Diocletian added, that if Galerius wished for the title
of emperor, there was nothing to hinder its being conferred on him and Constantius, as
well as on Maximian Herculius.</p>
<p>Galerius, whose imagination already grasped at the whole empire, saw that little but an
unsubstantial name would accrue to him from this proposal, and therefore replied that the
settlement made by Diocletian himself ought to be inviolable; a settlement which provided
that there should be two of higher rank vested with supreme power, and two others of inferior,
to assist them. Easily might concord be preserved between two equals, never amongst
four;1977 that he, if Diocletian would not resign, must consult his own interests, so as to remain
no longer in an inferior rank, and the last of that rank; that for fifteen years past he
had been confined, as an exile, to Illyricum and the banks of the Danube, perpetually
struggling against barbarous nations, while others, at their ease, governed dominions more
extensive than his, and better civilized.</p>
<p>Diocletian already knew, by letters from Maximian Herculius, all that Galerius had
spoken at their conference, and also that he was augmenting his army; and now, on hearing
his discourse, the spiritless old man burst into tears, and said, “Be it as you will.”</p>
<p>It remained to choose Cæsars by common consent. “But,” said Galerius, “why ask the
advice of Maximian and Constantius, since they must needs acquiesce in whatever we
do?”—“Certainly they will,” replied Diocletian, “for we must elect their sons.”</p>
<p>Now Maximian Herculius had a son, Maxentius, married to the daughter of Galerius,
a man of bad and mischievous dispositions, and so proud and stubborn withal, that he would
<note type="footnote">1977 [See p. 303, supra.]</note>

<pb n="711"/>
never pay the wonted obeisance either to his father or father-in-law, and on that account
he was hated by them both. Constantius also had a son, Constantine, a young man of very
great worth, and well meriting the high station of Cæsar. The distinguished comeliness of
his figure, his strict attention to all military duties, his virtuous demeanour and singular affability,
had endeared him to the troops, and made him the choice of every individual. He
was then at court, having long before been created by Diocletian a tribune of the first order.</p>
<p>“What is to be done?” said Galerius, “for that Maxentius deserves not the office. He
who, while yet a private man, has treated me with contumely, how will he act when once
he obtains power?”—“But Constantine is amiable, and will so rule as hereafter, in the
opinion of mankind, to surpass the mild virtues of his father.”—“Be it so, if my inclinations
and judgment are to be disregarded. Men ought to be appointed who are at my disposal,
who will dread me, and never do anything unless by my orders.”—“Whom then shall we
appoint?”—“Severus.”—“How! that dancer, that habitual drunkard, who turns night into
day, and day into night?”—“He deserves the office, for he has approved himself a faithful
paymaster and purveyor of the army; and, indeed, I have already despatched him to receive
the purple from the hands of Maximian.”—“Well, I consent; but whom else do you suggest?”—“
Him,” said Galerius, pointing out Daia, a young man, half-barbarian. Now Galerius
had lately bestowed part of his own name on that youth, and called him Maximin, in like
manner as Diocletian formerly bestowed on Galerius the name of Maximian, for the omen’s
sake, because Maximian Herculius had served him with unshaken fidelity.—“Who is that
you present?”—“A kinsman of mine.”—“Alas!” said Diocletian, heaving a deep sigh, “you
do not propose men fit for the charge of public affairs!”—“I have tried them.”—“Then do
you look to it, who are about to assume the administration of the empire: as for me, while
I continued emperor, long and diligent have been my labours in providing for the security
of the commonweal; and now, should anything disastrous ensue, the blame will not be
mine.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">

<head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
<p>Matters having been thus concerted, Diocletian and Galerius went in procession to
publish the nomination of Cæsars. Every one looked at Constantine; for there was no doubt
that the choice would fall on him. The troops present, as well as the chief soldiers of the
other legions, who had been summoned to the solemnity, fixed their eyes on Constantine,
exulted in the hope of his approaching election, and occupied themselves in prayers for his
prosperity. Near three miles from Nicomedia there is an eminence, on the summit of which
Galerius formerly received the purple; and there a pillar, with the statue of Jupiter, was
placed. Thither the procession went. An assembly of the soldiers was called. Diocletian, with
tears, harangued them, and said that he was become infirm, that he needed repose after his
fatigues, and that he would resign the empire into hands more vigorous and able, and at the
same time appoint new Cæsars. The spectators, with the utmost earnestness, waited for the
nomination. Suddenly he declared that the Cæsars were Severus and Maximin. The
amazement was universal. Constantine stood near in public view, and men began to question
amongst themselves whether his name too had not been changed into Maximin; when, in
the sight of all, Galerius, stretching back his hand, put Constantine aside, and drew Daia
forward, and, having divested him of the garb of a private person, set him in the most conspicuous
place. All men wondered who he could be, and from whence he came; but none
ventured to interpose or move objections, so confounded were their minds at the strange
and unlooked-for event. Diocletian took off his purple robe, put it on Daia, and resumed
his own original name of Diocles. He descended from the tribunal, and passed through
Nicomedia in a chariot; and then this old emperor, like a veteran soldier freed from military
service, was dismissed into his own country; while Daia, lately taken from the tending of
cattle in forests to serve as a common soldier, immediately made one of the life-guard,
presently a tribune, and next day Cæsar, obtained authority to trample under foot and oppress
the empire of the East; a person ignorant alike of war and of civil affairs, and from a herdsman
become a leader of armies.</p>

<head>CHAP. XX.</head>
<p>Galerius having effected the expulsion of the two old men, began to consider himself
alone as the sovereign of the Roman empire. Necessity had required the appointment of
Constantius to the first rank; but Galerius made small account of one who was of an easy
temper, and of health declining and precarious. He looked for the speedy death of
Constantius. And although that prince should recover, it seemed not difficult to force him
to put off the imperial purple; for what else could he do, if pressed by his three colleagues
to abdicate? Galerius had Licinius ever about his person, his old and intimate acquaintance,
and his earliest companion in arms, whose counsels he used in the management of all affairs;
yet he would not nominate Licinius to the dignity of Cæsar, with the title of son, for he
purposed to nominate him, in the room of Constantius, to the dignity of emperor, with the
title of brother, while he himself might hold sovereign authority, and rule over the whole
globe with unbounded licence. After that, he meant to have solemnized the vicennial festival;
to have conferred on his son Candidianus, then a boy of nine years of age, the office of
Cæsar; and, in conclusion, to have resigned, as Diocletian had done. And thus, Licinius and
Severus being emperors, and Maximin and Candidianus in the next station of Cæsars, he
fancied that, environed as it were by an impregnable wall, he should lead an old age of security
and peace. Such were his projects; but God, whom he had made his adversary, frustrated
all those imaginations.</p>

<p>Having thus attained to the highest power, he bent his mind to afflict that empire into
which he had opened his way. It is the manner and practice of the Persians for the people
to yield themselves slaves to their kings, and for the kings to treat their people as slaves. This
flagitious man, from the time of his victories over the Persians, was not ashamed incessantly
to extol such an institution, and he resolved to establish it in the Roman dominions; and
because he could not do this by an express law, he so acted, in imitation of the Persian kings,
as to bereave men of their liberties. He first of all degraded those whom he meant to punish;
and then not only were inferior magistrates put to the torture by him, but also the chief men
in cities, and persons of the most eminent rank, and this too in matters of little moment,
and in civil questions. Crucifixion was the punishment ready prepared in capital cases; and
for lesser crimes, fetters. Matrons of honourable station were dragged into workhouses; and
when any man was to be scourged, there were four posts fixed in the ground, and to them
he was tied, after a manner unknown in the chastisement of slaves. What shall I say of his
apartment for sport, and of his favourite diversions? He kept bears, most resembling himself
in fierceness and bulk, whom he had collected together during the course of his reign. As
often as he chose to indulge his humour, he ordered some particular bear to be brought in,
and men were thrown to that savage animal, rather to be swallowed up than devoured; and
when their limbs were torn asunder, he laughed with excessive complacency: nor did he
ever sup without being spectator of the effusion of human blood. Men of private station
were condemned to be burnt alive; and he began this mode of execution by edicts against
the Christians, commanding that, after torture and condemnation, they should be burnt at
a slow fire. They were fixed to a stake, and first a moderate flame was applied to the soles
of their feet, until the muscles, contracted by burning, were torn from the bones; then torches,
lighted and put out again, were directed to all the members of their bodies, so that no part
had any exemption. Meanwhile cold water was continually poured on their faces, and their
mouths moistened, lest, by reason of their jaws being parched, they should expire. At length
they did expire, when, after many hours, the violent heat had consumed their skin and
penetrated into their intestines. The dead carcases were laid on a funeral pile, and wholly
burnt; their bones were gathered, ground to powder, and thrown into the river, or into the
sea.</p>

<p>And now that cruelty, which he had learned in torturing the Christians, became habitual,
and he exercised it against all men indiscriminately.1978 He was not wont to inflict the
slighter sorts of punishment, as to banish, to imprison, or to send criminals to work in the
mines; but to burn, to crucify, to expose to wild beasts, were things done daily, and without
hesitation. For smaller offences, those of his own household and his stewards were chastised
with lances, instead of rods; and, in great offences, to be beheaded was an indulgence shown
to very few; and it seemed as a favour, on account of old services, when one was permitted
to die in the easiest manner. But these were slight evils in the government of Galerius, when
compared with what follows. For eloquence was extinguished, pleaders cut off, and the
learned in the laws either exiled or slain. Useful letters came to be viewed in the same light
as magical and forbidden arts; and all who possessed them were trampled upon and execrated,
as if they had been hostile to government, and public enemies. Law was dissolved, and unbounded
licence permitted to judges,—to judges chosen from amongst the soldiery, rude
and illiterate men, and let loose upon the provinces, without assessors to guide or control
them.</p>

<p>But that which gave rise to public and universal calamity, was the tax imposed at once
on each province and city. Surveyors having been spread abroad, and occupied in a general
and severe scrutiny, horrible scenes were exhibited, like the outrages of victorious enemies,
and the wretched state of captives. Each spot of ground was measured, vines and fruit-trees
numbered, lists taken of animals of every kind, and a capitation-roll made up. In cities, the
common people, whether residing within or without the walls, were assembled, the marketplaces
filled with crowds of families, all attended with their children and slaves, the noise
of torture and scourges resounded, sons were hung on the rack to force discovery of the effects
of their fathers, the most trusty slaves compelled by pain to bear witness against their masters,
and wives to bear witness against their husbands, In default of all other evidence, men were
tortured to speak against themselves; and no sooner did agony oblige them to acknowledge
what they had not, but those imaginary effects were noted down in the lists. Neither youth,
nor old age, nor sickness, afforded any exemption. The diseased and the infirm were carried
in; the age of each was estimated; and, that the capitation-tax might be enlarged, years were
added to the young and struck off from the old. General lamentation and sorrow prevailed.
Whatever, by the laws of war, conquerors had done to the conquered, the like did this man
presume to perpetrate against Romans and the subjects of Rome, because his forefathers
had been made liable to a like tax imposed by the victorious Trajan, as a penalty on the
Dacians for their frequent rebellions. After this, money was levied for each head, as if a price
had been paid for liberty to exist; yet full trust was not reposed on the same set of surveyors,
but others and others still were sent round to make further discoveries; and thus the tributes
were redoubled, not because the new surveyors made any fresh discoveries, but because
they added at pleasure to the former rates, lest they should seem to have been employed to
no purpose. Meanwhile the number of animals decreased, and men died; nevertheless taxes
were paid even for the dead, so that no one could either live or cease to live without being
subject to impositions. There remained mendicants alone, from whom nothing could be
exacted, and whom their misery and wretchedness secured from ill-treatment. But this pious
man had compassion on them, and determining that they should remain no longer in indigence,
he caused them all to be assembled, put on board vessels, and sunk in the sea. So
merciful was he in making provision that under his administration no man should want!
And thus, while he took effectual measures that none, under the reigned pretext of poverty,
should elude the tax, he put to death a multitude of real wretches, in violation of every law
of humanity.</p>

<p>Already the judgment of God approached him, and that season ensued in which his
fortunes began to droop and to waste away. While occupied in the manner that I have described
above, he did not set himself to subvert or expel Constantius, but waited for his
death, not imagining, however, that it was so nigh. Constantius, having become exceedingly
ill, wrote to Galerius, and requested that his son Constantine might be sent to see him. He
had made a like request long before, but in vain; for Galerius meant nothing less than to
grant it. On the contrary, he laid repeated snares for the life of that young man, because he
durst not use open violence, lest he should stir up civil wars against himself, and incur that
which he most dreaded, the hate and resentment of the army. Under pretence of manly exercise
and recreation, he made him combat with wild beasts: but this device was frustrated;
for the power of God protected Constantine, and in the very moment of jeopardy rescued
him from the hands of Galerius. At length, Galerius, when he could no longer avoid complying
with the request of Constantius, one evening gave Constantine a warrant to depart,
and commanded him to set out next morning with the imperial despatches. Galerius meant
either to find some pretext for detaining Constantine, or to forward orders to Severus for
arresting him on the road. Constantine discerned his purpose; and therefore, after supper,
when the emperor was gone to rest, he hasted away, carried off from the principal stages all
the horses maintained at the public expense, and escaped. Next day the emperor, having
purposely remained in his bed-chamber until noon, ordered Constantine to be called into
his presence; but he learnt that Constantine had set out immediately after supper. Outrageous
with passion, he ordered horses to be made ready, that Constantine might be pursued and
dragged back; and hearing that all the horses had been carried off from the great road, he
could hardly refrain from tears. Meanwhile Constantine, journeying with incredible rapidity,
reached his father, who was already about to expire. Constantius recommended his son to
the soldiers, delivered the sovereign authority into his hands, and then died, as his wish had
long been, in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Constantine Augustus, having assumed the government, made it his first care to restore
the Christians to the exercise of their worship and to their God; and so began his administration
by reinstating1979 the holy religion.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
<p>Some few days after, the portrait of Constantine, adorned with laurels, was brought to
the pernicious wild beast, that, by receiving that symbol, he might acknowledge Constantine
in the quality of emperor. He hesitated long whether to receive it or not, and he was about
to commit both the portrait and its bearer to the flames, but his confidants dissuaded him
from a resolution so frantic. They admonished him of the danger, and they represented
that, if Constantine came with an armed force, all the soldiers, against whose inclination
obscure or unknown Cæsars had been created, would acknowledge him, and crowd eagerly
to his standard. So Galerius, although with the utmost unwillingness, accepted the portrait,
and sent the imperial purple to Constantine, that he might seem of his own accord to have
received that prince into partnership of power with him. And now his plans were deranged,
and he could not, as he intended formerly, admit Licinius, without exceeding the limited
number of emperors. But this he devised, that Severus, who was more advanced in life,
should be named emperor, and that Constantine, instead of the title of emperor, to which
he had been named, should receive that of Cæsar in common with Maximin Daia, and so
be degraded from the second place to the fourth.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
<pb n="719"/>
<head>CHAP. XXVI.</head>
<p>Things seemed to be arranged in some measure to the satisfaction of Galerius, when
another alarm was brought, that his son-in-law Maxentius had been declared emperor at
Rome. The cause was this: Galerius having resolved by permanent taxes to devour the empire,
soared to such extravagance in folly, as not to allow an exemption from that thraldom even
to the Roman people. Tax-gatherers therefore were appointed to go to Rome, and make out
lists of the citizens. Much about the same time Galerius had reduced the Pretorian Guards.
There remained at Rome a few soldiers of that body, who, profiting of the opportunity, put
some magistrates to death, and, with the acquiescence of the tumultuary populace, clothed
Maxentius in the imperial purple. Galerius, on receiving this news, was disturbed at the
strangeness of the event, but not much dismayed. He hated Maxentius, and he could not
bestow on him the dignity of Cæsar already enjoyed by two (Daia and Constantine); besides,
he thought it enough for him to have once bestowed that dignity against his inclination. So
he sent for Severus, exhorted him to regain his dominion and sovereignty, and he put under
his command that army which Maximian Herculius had formerly commanded, that he
might attack Maxentius at Rome. There the soldiers of Maximian had been oftentimes received
with every sort of luxurious accommodation, so that they were not only interested
to preserve the city, but they also longed to fix their residence in it.</p>
<p>Maxentius well knew the enormity of his own offences; and although he had as it were
an hereditary claim to the services of his father’s army, and might have hoped to draw it
over to himself, yet he reflected that this consideration might occur to Galerius also, and
induce him to leave Severus in Illyricum, and march in person with his own army against
Rome. Under such apprehensions, Maxentius sought to protect himself from the danger
that hung over him. To his father, who since his abdication resided in Campania, he sent
the purple, and saluted him again Augustus. Maximian, given to change, eagerly resumed
that purple of which he had unwillingly divested himself. Meanwhile Severus marched on,
and with his troops approached the walls of the city. Presently the soldiers raised up their
ensigns, abandoned Severus, and yielded themselves to Maxentius, against whom they had
come. What remained but flight for Severus, thus deserted? He was encountered by
Maximian, who had resumed the imperial dignity. On this he took refuge in Ravenna, and
shut himself up there with a few soldiers. But perceiving that he was about to be delivered
up, he voluntarily surrendered himself, and restored the purple to him from whom he had
received it; and after this he obtained no other grace but that of an easy death, for he was
compelled to open his veins, and in that gentle manner expired.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">
<pb n="720"/>
<head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
<p>But Maximian, who knew the outrageous temper of Galerius, began to consider that,
fired with rage on hearing of the death of Severus, he would march into Italy, and that possibly
he might be joined by Daia, and so bring into the field forces too powerful to be resisted.
Having therefore fortified Rome, and made diligent provision for a defensive war, Maximian
went into Gaul, that he might give his younger daughter Fausta in marriage to Constantine,
and thus win over that prince to his interest. Meantime Galerius assembled his troops, invaded
Italy, and advanced towards Rome, resolving to extinguish the senate and put the
whole people to the sword. But he found everything shut and fortified against him. There
was no hope of carrying the place by storm, and to besiege it was an arduous undertaking;
for Galerius had not brought with him an army sufficient to invest the walls. Probably,
having never seen Rome, he imagined it to be little superior in size to those cities with which
be was acquainted. But some of his legions, detesting the wicked enterprise of a father against
his son-in-law, and of Romans against Rome, renounced his authority, and carried over
their ensigns to the enemy. Already had his remaining soldiers begun to waver, when
Galerius, dreading a fate like that of Severus, and having his haughty spirit broken and humiliated,
threw himself at the feet of his soldiers, and continued to beseech them that he
might not be delivered to the foe, until, by the promise of mighty largesses, he prevailed on
them. Then he retreated from Rome, and fled in great disorder. Easily might he have been
cut off in his flight, had any one pursued him even with a small body of troops. He was
aware of his danger, and allowed his soldiers to disperse themselves, and to plunder and
destroy far and wide, that, if there were any pursuers, they might be deprived of all means
of subsistence in a ruined country. So the parts of Italy through which that pestilent band
took its course were wasted, all things pillaged, matrons forced, virgins violated, parents
and husbands compelled by torture to disclose where they had concealed their goods, and
their wives and daughters; flocks and herds of cattle were driven off like spoils taken from
barbarians. And thus did he, once a Roman emperor, but now the ravager of Italy, retire
into his own territories, after having afflicted all men indiscriminately with the calamities
of war. Long ago, indeed, and at the very time of his obtaining sovereign power, he had
avowed himself the enemy of the Roman name; and he proposed that the empire should be
called, not the Roman, but the Dacian empire.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">

<head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
<p>After the flight of Galerius, Maximian, having returned from Gaul, held authority in
common with his son; but more obedience was yielded to the young man than to the old:
for Maxentius had most power, and had been longest in possession of it; and it was to him
that Maximian owed on this occasion the imperial dignity. The old man was impatient at
being denied the exercise of uncontrolled sovereignty, and envied his son with a childish
spirit of rivalry; and therefore he began to consider how he might expel Maxentius and resume
his ancient dominion. This appeared easy, because the soldiers who deserted Severus
had originally served in his own army. He called an assembly of the people of Rome, and
of the soldiers, as if he had been to make an harangue on the calamitous situation of public
affairs. After having spoken much on that subject, he stretched his hands towards his son,
charged him as author of all ills and prime cause of the calamities of the state, and then tore
the purple from his shoulders. Maxentius, thus stripped, leaped headlong from the tribunal,
and was received into the arms of the soldiers. Their rage and clamour confounded the unnatural
old man, and, like another Tarquin the Proud, he was driven from Rome.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<pb n="722"/>
<head>CHAP. XXIX.</head>
<p>Then Maximian returned into Gaul; and after having made some stay in those quarters,
he went to Galerius, the enemy of his son, that they might confer together, as he pretended,
about the settlement of the commonweal; but his true purpose was, under colour of reconciliation,
to find an opportunity of murdering Galerius, and of seizing his share of the empire,
instead of his own, from which he had been everywhere excluded.</p>
<p>Diocles was at the court of Galerius when Maximian arrived; for Galerius, meaning now
to invest Licinius with the ensigns of supreme power in the room of Severus, had lately sent
for Diocles to be present at the solemnity. So it was performed in presence both of him and
of Maximian; and thus there were six who ruled the empire at one and the same time.1980</p>
<p>Now the designs of Maximian having been frustrated, he took flight, as he had done
twice before, and returned into Gaul, with a heart full of wickedness, and intending by
treacherous devices to overreach Constantine, who was not only his own son-in-law, but
also the child of his son-in-law; and that he might the more successfully deceive, he laid
aside the imperial purple. The Franks had taken up arms. Maximian advised the unsuspecting
Constantine not to lead all his troops against them, and he said that a few soldiers would
suffice to subdue those barbarians. He gave this advice that an army might be left for him
to win over to himself, and that Constantine, by reason of his scanty forces, might be overpowered.
The young prince believed the advice to be judicious, because given by an aged
and experienced commander; and he followed it, because given by a father-in-law. He
marched, leaving the most considerable part of his forces behind. Maximian waited a few
days; and as soon as, by his calculation, Constantine had entered the territory of the barbarians,
he suddenly resumed the imperial purple, seized the public treasures, after his wont
made ample donatives to the soldiery, and feigned that such disasters had befallen
Constantine as soon after befell himself. Constantine was presently informed of those events,
and, by marches astonishingly rapid, he flew back with his army. Maximian, not yet prepared
to oppose him, was overpowered at unawares, and the soldiers returned to their duty.
Maximian had possessed himself of Marseilles (he fled thither), and shut the gates.
Constantine drew nigh, and seeing Maximian on the walls, addressed him in no harsh or
hostile language, and demanded what he meant, and what it was that he wanted, and why
he had acted in a way so peculiarly unbecoming him. But Maximian from the walls incessantly
uttered abuse and curses against Constantine. Then, of a sudden, the gates on the opposite
side having been unbarred, the besiegers were admitted into the city. The rebel emperor,
and unnatural parent and a perfidious father-in-law, was dragged into the presence of

Constantine, heard a recital made of his crimes, was divested of his imperial robe, and, after
this reprimand, obtained his life.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXX.</head>
<p>Maximian, having thus forfeited the respect due to an emperor and a father-in-law,
grew impatient at his abased condition, and, emboldened by impunity, formed new plots
against Constantine. He addressed himself to his daughter Fausta, and, as well by entreaties
as by the soothing of flattery, solicited her to betray her husband. He promised to obtain
for her a more honourable alliance than that with Constantine; and he requested her to allow
the bed-chamber of the emperor to be left open, and to be slightly guarded. Fausta undertook
to do whatever he asked, and instantly revealed the whole to her husband. A plan was laid
for detecting Maximian in the very execution of his crime. They placed a base eunuch to be
murdered instead of the emperor. At the dead of night Maximian arose, and perceived all
things to be favourable for his insidious purpose. There were few soldiers on guard, and
these too at some distance from the bed-chamber. However, to prevent suspicion, he accosted
them, and said that he had had a dream which he wished to communicate to his son-in-law.
He went in armed, slew the eunuch, sprung forth exultingly, and avowed the murder. At
that moment Constantine showed himself on the opposite side with a band of soldiers; the
dead body was brought out of the bed-chamber; the murderer, taken in the fact, all aghast,
<lg>
<l>“Stood like a stone, silent and motionless;”</l>
</lg>
while Constantine upbraided him for his impiety and enormous guilt. At last Maximian
obtained leave that the manner of his death should be at his own choice, and he strangled
himself.</p>
<p>Thus that mightiest sovereign of Rome—who ruled so long with exceeding glory, and
who celebrated his twentieth anniversary—thus that most haughty man had his neck broken,
and ended his detestable life by a death base and ignominious.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">

<head>CHAP. XXXI.</head>
<p>From Maximian, God, the avenger of religion and of His people, turned his eyes to
Galerius, the author of the accursed persecution, that in his punishment also He might
manifest the power of His majesty. Galerius, too, was purposing to celebrate his twentieth
anniversary; and as, under that pretext, he had, by new taxes payable in gold and silver,
oppressed the provinces, so now, that he might recompense them by celebrating the promised
festival, he used the like pretext for repeating his oppressions. Who can relate in fit terms
the methods used to harass mankind in levying the tax, and especially with regard to corn
and the other fruits of the earth? The officers, or rather the executioners, of all the different
magistrates, seized on each individual, and would never let go their hold. No man knew to
whom he ought to make payment first. There was no dispensation given to those who had
nothing; and they were required, under pain of being variously tortured, instantly to pay,
notwithstanding their inability. Many guards were set round, no breathing time was granted,
or, at any season of the year, the least respite from exactions. Different magistrates, or the
officers of different magistrates, frequently contended for the right of levying the tax from
the same persons. No threshing-floor without a tax-gatherer, no vintage without a watch,
and nought left for the sustenance of the husbandman! That food should be snatched from
the mouths of those who had earned it by toil, was grievous: the hope, however, of being
afterwards relieved, might have made that grievance supportable; but it was necessary for
every one who appeared at the anniversary festival to provide robes of various kinds, and
gold and silver besides. And one might have said, “How shall I furnish myself with those
things, O tyrant void of understanding, if you carry off the whole fruits of my ground, and
violently seize its expected produce?” Thus, throughout the dominions of Galerius, men
were spoiled of their goods, and all was raked together into the imperial treasury, that the
emperor might be enabled to perform his vow of celebrating a festival which he was doomed
never to celebrate.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">

<head>CHAP. XXXII.</head>
<p>Maximin Daia was incensed at the nomination of Licinius to the dignity of emperor,
and he would no longer be called Cæsar, or allow himself to be ranked as third in authority.
Galerius, by repeated messages, besought Daia to yield, and to acquiesce in his arrangement,
to give place to age, and to reverence the grey hairs of Licinius. But Daia became more and
more insolent. He urged that, as it was he who first assumed the purple, so, by possession,
he had right to priority in rank; and he set at nought the entreaties and the injunctions of
Galerius. That brute animal was stung to the quick, and bellowed when the mean creature
whom he had made Cæsar, in expectation of his thorough obsequiousness, forgot the great
favour conferred on him, and impiously withstood the requests and will of his benefactor.
Galerius at length, overcome by the obstinacy of Daia, abolished the subordinate title of
Cæsar, gave to himself and Licinius that of the Augusti, and to Daia and Constantine that
of sons of the Augusti. Daia, some time after, in a letter to Galerius, took occasion to observe,
that at the last general muster he had been saluted by his army under the title of Augustus.
Galerius, vexed and grieved at this, commanded that all the four should have the appellation
of emperor.1981</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXIII.</head>
<p>And now, when Galerius was in the eighteenth year of his reign, God struck him with
an incurable plague. A malignant ulcer formed itself low down in his secret parts, and spread
by degrees. The physicians attempted to eradicate it, and healed up the place affected. But
the sore, after having been skinned over, broke out again; a vein burst, and the blood flowed
in such quantity as to endanger his life. The blood, however, was stopped, although with
difficulty. The physicians had to undertake their operations anew, and at length they cicatrized
the wound. In consequence of some slight motion of his body, Galerius received a
hurt, and the blood streamed more abundantly than before. He grew emaciated, pallid, and
feeble, and the bleeding then stanched. The ulcer began to be insensible to the remedies
applied, and a gangrene seized all the neighbouring parts. It diffused itself the wider the
more the corrupted flesh was cut away, and everything employed as the means of cure served
but to aggravate the disease.
<lg>
<l>“The masters of the healing art withdrew.”</l>
</lg>
Then famous physicians were brought in from all quarters; but no human means had any
success. Apollo and Æsculapius were besought importunately for remedies: Apollo did
prescribe, and the distemper augmented. Already approaching to its deadly crisis, it had
occupied the lower regions of his body: his bowels came out, and his whole seat putrefied.
The luckless physicians, although without hope of overcoming the malady, ceased not to
apply fomentations and administer medicines. The humours having been repelled, the distemper
attacked his intestines, and worms were generated in his body. The stench was so
foul as to pervade not only the palace, but even the whole city; and no wonder, for by that
time the passages from his bladder and bowels, having been devoured by the worms, became
indiscriminate, and his body, with intolerable anguish, was dissolved into one mass of corruption.

<p>They applied warm flesh of animals to the chief seat of the disease, that the warmth
might draw out those minute worms; and accordingly, when the dressings were removed,
there issued forth an innumerable swarm: nevertheless the prolific disease had hatched
swarms much more abundant to prey upon and consume his intestines. Already, through
a complication of distempers, the different parts of his body had lost their natural form: the
superior part was dry, meagre, and haggard, and his ghastly-looking skin had settled itself
<note type="footnote">1982 [Acts xii. 23.]</note>

<pb n="728"/>
deep amongst his bones while the inferior, distended like bladders, retained no appearance
of joints. These things happened in the course of a complete year; and at length, overcome
by calamities, he was obliged to acknowledge God, and he cried aloud, in the intervals of
raging pain, that he would re-edify the Church which he had demolished, and make atonement
for his misdeeds; and when he was near his end, he published an edict of the tenor
following:—</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
<pb n="729"/>
<head>CHAP. XXXIV.</head>
<p>“Amongst our other regulations for the permanent advantage of the commonweal, we
have hitherto studied to reduce all things to a conformity with the ancient laws and public
discipline of the Romans.</p>
<p>“It has been our aim in an especial manner, that the Christians also, who had abandoned
the religion of their forefathers, should return to right opinions. For such wilfulness and
folly had, we know not how, taken possession of them, that instead of observing those ancient
institutions, which possibly their own forefathers had established, they, through caprice,
made laws to themselves, and drew together into different societies many men of widely
different persuasions.</p>
<p>“After the publication of our edict, ordaining the Christians to betake themselves to the
observance of the ancient institutions, many of them were subdued through the fear of
danger, and moreover many of them were exposed to jeopardy; nevertheless, because great
numbers still persist in their opinions, and because we have perceived that at present they
neither pay reverence and due adoration to the gods, nor yet worship their own God,
therefore we, from our wonted clemency in bestowing pardon on all, have judged it fit to
extend our indulgence to those men, and to permit them again to be Christians, and to establish
the places of their religious assemblies; yet so as that they offend not against good
order.</p>
<p>“By another mandate we purpose to signify unto magistrates how they ought herein to
demean themselves.</p>
<p>“Wherefore it will be the duty of the Christians, in consequence of this our toleration,
to pray to their God for our welfare, and for that of the public, and for their own; that the
commonweal may continue safe in every quarter, and that they themselves may live securely
in their habitations.”</p>

<p>This edict was promulgated at Nicomedia on the day preceding the kalends of May,1983
in the eighth consulship of Galerius, and the second of Maximin Daia. Then the prisongates
having been thrown open, you, my best beloved Donatus,1984 together with the other
confessors for the faith, were set at liberty from a jail, which had been your residence for six
years. Galerius, however, did not, by publication of this edict, obtain the divine forgiveness.
In a few days after he was consumed by the horrible disease that had brought on an universal
putrefaction. Dying, he recommended his wife and son to Licinius, and delivered them over
into his hands. This event was known at Nicomedia before the end of the month.1985 His
vicennial anniversary was to have been celebrated on the ensuing kalends of March.1986</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXVI.</head>
<p>Daia, on receiving this news, hasted with relays of horses from the East, to seize the
dominions of Galerius, and, while Licinius lingered in Europe, to arrogate to himself all the
country as far as the narrow seas of Chalcedon. On his entry into Bithynia, he, with the view
of acquiring immediate popularity, abolished Galerius’ tax, to the great joy of all. Dissension
arose between the two emperors, and almost an open war. They stood on the opposite shores
with their armies. Peace, however, and amity were established under certain conditions.
Licinius and Daia met on the narrow sees, concluded a treaty, and in token of friendship
joined hands. Then Daia, believing all things to be in security, returned (to Nicomedia),
and was in his new dominions what he had been in Syria and Egypt. First of all, he took
away the toleration and general protection granted by Galerius to the Christians, and, for
this end, he secretly procured addresses from different cities, requesting that no Christian
church might be built within their walls; and thus he meant to make that which was his own
choice appear as if extorted from him by importunity. In compliance with those addresses,
he introduced a new mode of government in things respecting religion, and for each city
he created a high priest, chosen from among the persons of most distinction. The office of
those men was to make daily sacrifices to all their gods, and, with the aid of the former
priests, to prevent the Christians from erecting churches, or from worshipping God either
publicly or in private; and he authorized them to compel the Christians to sacrifice to idols,
and, on their refusal, to bring them before the civil magistrate; and, as if this had not been
enough, in every province he established a superintendent priest, one of chief eminence in
the state; and he commanded that all those priests newly instituted should appear in white
habits, that being the most honourable distinction of dress.1987 And as to the Christians,
he purposed to follow the course that he had followed in the East, and, affecting the show
of clemency, he forbade the slaying of God’s servants, but he gave command that they should
be mutilated. So the confessors for the faith had their ears and nostrils slit, their hands and
feet lopped off, and their eyes dug out of the sockets.</p>
<note type="footnote">1987 [Singular that he does not assert that in this he imitated the Christian discipline.]</note>

<head>CHAP. XXXVII.</head>
<p>While occupied in this plan, he received letters from Constantine which deterred him
from proceeding in its execution, so for a time he dissembled his purpose; nevertheless any
Christian that fell within his power was privily thrown into the sea. Neither did he cease
from his custom of sacrificing every day in the palace. It was also an invention of his to cause
all animals used for food to be slaughtered, not by cooks, but by priests at the altars; so that
nothing was ever served up, unless foretasted, consecrated, and sprinkled with wine, according
to the rites of paganism; and whoever was invited to an entertainment must needs have
returned from it impure and defiled. In all things else he resembled his preceptor Galerius.
For if aught chanced to have been left untouched by Diocles and Maximian, that did Daia
greedily and shamelessly carry off. And now the granaries of each individual were shut, and
all warehouses sealed up, and taxes, not yet due, were levied by anticipation. Hence famine,
from neglect of cultivation, and the prices of all things enhanced beyond measure. Herds
and flocks were driven from their pasture for the daily sacrifice. By gorging his soldiers with
the flesh of sacrifices, he so corrupted them, that they disdained their wonted pittance in
corn, and wantonly threw it away. Meanwhile Daia recompensed his bodyguards, who were
very numerous, with costly raiment and gold medals, made donatives in silver to the common
soldiers and recruits, and bestowed every sort of largess on the barbarians who served in
his army. As to grants of the property of living persons, which he made to his favourites
whenever they chose to ask what belonged to another, I know not whether the same thanks
might not be due to him that are given to merciful robbers, who spoil without murdering.</p>

<head>CHAP. XXXVIII.</head>
<p>But that which distinguished his character, and in which he transcended all former
emperors, was his desire of debauching women. What else can I call it but a blind and
headstrong passion? Yet such epithets feebly express my indignation in reciting his
enormities. The magnitude of the guilt overpowers my tongue, and makes it unequal to its
office. Eunuchs and panders made search everywhere, and no sooner was any comely face
discovered, than husbands and parents were obliged to withdraw. Matrons of quality and
virgins were stripped of their robes, and all their limbs were inspected, lest any part should
be unworthy of the bed of the emperor. Whenever a woman resisted, death by drowning
was inflicted on her; as if, under the reign of this adulterer, chastity had been treason. Some
men there were, who, beholding the violation of wives whom for virtue and fidelity they
affectionately loved, could not endure their anguish of mind, and so killed themselves. While
this monster ruled, it was singular deformity alone which could shield the honour of any
female from his savage desires. At length he introduced a custom prohibiting marriage unless
with the imperial permission; and he made this an instrument to serve the purposes of his
lewdness. After having debauched freeborn maidens, he gave them for wives to his slaves.
His conflicts also imitated the example of the emperor, and violated with impunity the beds
of their dependants. For who was there to punish such offences? As for the daughters of
men of middle rank, any who were inclined took them by force. Ladies of quality, who could
not be taken by force, were petitioned for, and obtained from the emperor by way of free
gift. Nor could a father oppose this; for the imperial warrant having been once signed, he
had no alternative but to die, or to receive some barbarian as his son-in-law. For hardly was
there any person in the lifeguard except of those people, who, having been driven from their
habitations by the Goths in the twentieth year of Diocletian, yielded themselves to Galerius
and entered into his service. It was ill for humankind, that men who had fled from the
bondage of barbarians should thus come to lord it over the Romans. Environed by such
guards, Daia oppressed and insulted the Eastern empire.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">

<head>CHAP. XXXIX.</head>
<p>Now Daia, in gratifying his libidinous desires, made his own will the standard of right;
and therefore he would not refrain from soliciting the widow of Galerius, the Empress
Valeria, to whom he had lately given the appellation of mother. After the death of her hus-
band, she had repaired to Daia, because she imagined that she might live with more security
in his dominions than elsewhere, especially as he was a married man; but the flagitious
creature became instantly inflamed with a passion for her. Valeria was still in weeds, the
time of her mourning not being yet expired. He sent a message to her proposing marriage,
and offering, on her compliance, to put away his wife. She frankly returned an answer such
as she alone could dare to do: first, that she would not treat of marriage while she was in
weeds, and while the ashes of Galerius, her husband, and, by adoption, the father of Daia,
were yet warm; next, that he acted impiously, in proposing to divorce a faithful wife to make
room for another, whom in her turn he would also cast off; and, lastly, that it was indecent,
unexampled, and unlawful for a woman of her title and dignity to engage a second time in
wedlock.1988 This bold answer having been reported to Daia, presently his desires changed
into rage and furious resentment. He pronounced sentence of forfeiture against the princess,
seized her goods, removed her attendants, tortured her eunuchs to death, and banished her
and her mother Prisca: but he appointed no particular place for her residence while in
banishment; and hence he insultingly expelled her from every abode that she took in the
course of her wanderings; and, to complete all, he condemned the ladies who enjoyed most
of her friendship and confidence to die on a false accusation of adultery.</p>

<head>CHAP. XL.</head>
<p>There was a certain matron of high rank who already had grandchildren by more than
one son. Her Valeria loved like a second mother, and Daia suspected that her advice had
produced that refusal which Valeria gave to his matrimonial offers; and therefore he charged
the president Eratineus to have her put to death in a way that might injure her fame. To her
two others, equally noble, were added. One of them, who had a daughter a Vestal virgin at
Rome, maintained an intercourse by stealth with the banished Valeria. The other, married
to a senator, was intimately connected with the empress. Excellent beauty and virtue proved
the cause of their death. They were dragged to the tribunal, not of an upright judge, but of
a robber. Neither indeed was there any accuser, until a certain Jew, one charged with other
offences, was induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the innocent.
The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the city under a guard, lest the
populace should have stoned him. This tragedy was acted at Nicæa. The Jew was ordered
to the torture till he should speak as he had been instructed, while the torturers by blows
prevented the women from speaking in their own defence. The innocent were condemned
to die. Then there arose wailing and lamentation, not only of the senator, who attended on
his well-deserving consort, but amongst the spectators also, whom this proceeding, scandalous
and unheard of, had brought together; and, to prevent the multitude from violently
rescuing the condemned persons out of the hands of the executioners, military commanders
followed with light infantry and archers. And thus, under a guard of armed soldiers, they
were led to punishment. Their domestics having been forced to flee, they would have remained
without burial, had not the compassion of friends interred them by stealth. Nor was
the promise of pardon made good to the feigned adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and
then he disclosed the whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all
the beholders that the women died innocent.</p>

<p>But the empress, an exile in some desert region of Syria, secretly informed her father
Diocletian of the calamity that had befallen her. He despatched messengers to Daia, requesting
that his daughter might be sent to him. He could not prevail. Again and again he entreated;
yet she was not sent. At length he employed a relation of his, a military man high in power
and authority, to implore Daia by the remembrance of past favours. This messenger, equally
unsuccessful in his negotiation as the others, reported to Diocletian that his prayers were
vain.</p>

<p>At this time, by command of Constantine, the statues of Maximian Herculius were
thrown down, and his portraits removed; and, as the two old emperors were generally delineated
in one piece, the portraits of both were removed at the same time. Thus Diocletian
lived to see a disgrace which no former emperor had ever seen, and, under the double load
of vexation of spirit and bodily maladies, he resolved to die. Tossing to and fro, with his
soul agitated by grief, he could neither eat nor take rest. He sighed, groaned, and wept often,
and incessantly threw himself into various postures, now on his couch, and now on the
ground. So he, who for twenty years was the most prosperous of emperors, having been cast
down into the obscurity of a private station, treated in the most contumelious manner, and
compelled to abhor life, became incapable of receiving nourishment, and, worn out with
anguish of mind, expired.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
<pb n="738"/>
<head>CHAP. XLIII.</head>
<p>Of the adversaries of God there still remained one, whose overthrow and end I am now
to relate.</p>
<p>Daia had entertained jealousy and ill-will against Licinius from the time that the preference
was given to him by Galerius; and those sentiments still subsisted, notwithstanding
the treaty of peace lately concluded between them. When Daia heard that the sister of
Constantine was betrothed to Licinius, he apprehended that the two emperors, by contracting
this affinity, meant to league against him; so he privily sent ambassadors to Rome, desiring
a friendly alliance with Maxentius: he also wrote to him in terms of cordiality. The ambassadors
were received courteously, friendship established, and in token of it the effigies of
Maxentius and Daia were placed together in public view. Maxentius willingly embraced
this, as if it had been an aid from heaven; for he had already declared war against Constantine,
as if to revenge the death of his father Maximian. From this appearance of filial piety a suspicion
arose, that the detestable old man had but feigned a quarrel with his son that he might
have an opportunity to destroy his rivals in power, and so make way for himself and his son
to possess the whole empire. This conjecture, however, had no foundation; for his true
purpose was to have destroyed his son and the others, and then to have reinstated himself
and Diocletian in sovereign authority.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">
<pb n="739"/>
<head>CHAP. XLIV.</head>
<p>And now a civil war broke out between Constantine and Maxentius. Although Maxentius
kept himself within Rome, because the soothsayers had foretold that if he went out of it he
should perish, yet he conducted the military operations by able generals. In forces he exceeded
his adversary; for he had not only his father’s army, which deserted from Severus, but also
his own, which he had lately drawn together out of Mauritania and Italy. They fought, and
the troops of Maxentius prevailed. At length Constantine, with steady courage and a mind
prepared for every event, led his whole forces to the neighbourhood of Rome, and encamped
them opposite to the Milvian bridge. The anniversary of the reign of Maxentius approached,
that is, the sixth of the kalends of November,1989 and the fifth year of his reign was drawing
to an end.</p>
<p>Constantine was directed in a dream to cause the heavenly sign to be delineated on the
shields of his soldiers, and so to proceed to battle. He did as he had been commanded, and
he marked on their shields the letter Χ, with a perpendicular line drawn through it and
turned round thus at the top, being the cipher of Christ. Having this sign (ΧР ), his troops
stood to arms. The enemies advanced, but without their emperor, and they crossed the
bridge. The armies met, and fought with the utmost exertions of valour, and firmly maintained
their ground. In the meantime a sedition arose at Rome, and Maxentius was reviled
as one who had abandoned all concern for the safety of the commonweal; and suddenly,
while he exhibited the Circensian games on the anniversary of his reign, the people cried
with one voice, “Constantine cannot be overcome!” Dismayed at this, Maxentius burst from
the assembly, and having called some senators together, ordered the Sibylline books to be
searched. In them it was found that:—
<lg>
<l>“On the same day the enemy of the Romans should perish.”</l>
</lg>
Led by this response to the hopes of victory, he went to the field. The bridge in his rear was
broken down. At sight of that the battle grew hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed, and
the forces of Maxentius were routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude
pressing on him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber.</p>
<p>This destructive war being ended, Constantine was acknowledged as emperor, with
great rejoicings, by the senate and people of Rome. And now he came to know the perfidy
of Daia; for he found the letters written to Maxentius, and saw the statues and portraits of
the two associates which had been set up together. The senate, in reward of the valour of
Constantine, decreed to him the title of Maximus (the Greatest), a title which Daia had always
arrogated to himself. Daia, when he heard that Constantine was victorious and Rome freed,
expressed as much sorrow as if he himself had been vanquished; but afterwards, when he
<note type="footnote">1989 27th of October.</note>

<pb n="740"/>
heard of the decree of the senate, he grew outrageous, avowed enmity towards Constantine,
and made his title of the Greatest a theme of abuse and raillery.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
<pb n="741"/>
<head>CHAP. XLV.</head>
<p>Constantine having settled all things at Rome, went to Milan about the beginning of
winter. Thither also Licinius came to receive his wife Constantia. When Daia understood
that they were busied in solemnizing the nuptials, he moved out of Syria in the depth of a
severe winter, and by forced marches he came into Bithynia with an army much impaired;
for he lost all his beasts of burden, of whatever kind, in consequence of excessive rains and
snow, miry ways, cold and fatigue. Their carcases, scattered about the roads, seemed an
emblem of the calamities of the impending war, and the presage of a like destruction that
awaited the soldiers. Daia did not halt in his own territories; but immediately crossed the
Thracian Bosphorus, and in a hostile manner approached the gates of Byzantium. There
was a garrison in the city, established by Licinius to check any invasion that Daia might
make. At first Daia attempted to entice the soldiers by the promise of donatives, and then
to intimidate them by assault and storm. Yet neither promises nor force availed aught. After
eleven days had elapsed, within which time Licinius might have learned the state of the
garrison, the soldiers surrendered, not through treachery, but because they were too weak
to make a longer resistance. Then Daia moved on to Heraclea (otherwise called Perinthus),
and by delays of the like nature before that place lost some days. And now Licinius by expeditious
marches had reached Adrianople, but with forces not numerous. Then Daia,
having taken Perinthus by capitulation, and remained there for a short space, moved forwards
eighteen miles to the first station. Here his progress was stopped; for Licinius had already
occupied the second station, at the distance also of eighteen miles. Licinius, having assembled
what forces he could from the neighbouring quarters, advanced towards Daia rather indeed
to retard his operations than with any purpose of fighting, or hope of victory: for Daia had
an army of seventy thousand men, while he himself had scarce thirty thousand; for his soldiers
being dispersed in various regions, there was not time, on that sudden emergency, to collect
all of them together.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
<pb n="742"/>
<head>CHAP. XLVI.</head>
<p>The armies thus approaching each other, seemed on the eve of a battle. Then Daia made
this vow to Jupiter, that if he obtained victory he would extinguish and utterly efface the
name of the Christians. And on the following night an angel of the Lord seemed to stand
before Licinius while he was asleep, admonishing him to arise immediately, and with his
whole army to put up a prayer to the Supreme God, and assuring him that by so doing he
should obtain victory. Licinius fancied that, hearing this, he arose, and that his monitor,
who was nigh him, directed how be should pray, and in what words. Awaking from sleep,
he sent for one of his secretaries, and dictated these words exactly as he had heard them:—
<lg>
<l>“Supreme God, we beseech Thee; Holy God, we beseech Thee; unto Thee we commend all
right; unto Thee we commend our safety; unto Thee we commend our empire. By Thee
we live, by Thee we are victorious and happy. Supreme Holy God, hear our prayers; to
Thee we stretch forth our arms. Hear, Holy Supreme God.”</l>
</lg>
Many copies were made of these words, and distributed amongst the principal commanders,
who were to teach them to the soldiers under their charge. At this all men took fresh courage,
in the confidence that victory bad been announced to them from heaven. Licinius resolved
to give battle on the kalends of May;1990 for precisely eight years before Daia had received
the dignity of Cæsar, and Licinius chose that day in hopes that Daia might be vanquished
on the anniversary of his reign, as Maxentius had been on his. Daia, however, purposed to
give battle earlier, to fight on the day before those kalends,1991 and to triumph on the anniversary
of his reign. Accounts came that Daia was in motion; the soldiers of Licinius armed
themselves; and advanced. A barren and open plain, called Campus Serenus, lay between
the two armies. They were now in sight of one another. The soldiers of Licinius placed their
shields on the ground, took off their helmets, and, following the example of their leaders,
stretched forth their hands towards heaven. Then the emperor uttered the prayer, and they
all repeated it after him. The host, doomed to speedy destruction, heard the murmur of the
prayers of their adversaries. And now, the ceremony having been thrice performed, the
soldiers of Licinius became full of courage, buckled on their helmets again, and resumed
their shields. The two emperors advanced to a conference: but Daia could not be brought
to peace; for he held Licinius in contempt, and imagined that the soldiers would presently
abandon an emperor parsimonious in his donatives, and enter into the service of one liberal
even to profusion. And indeed it was on this notion that he began the war. He looked for
<note type="footnote">1990 1st of May. [As to the angel, see Gibbon, cap. xx. note 41.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1991 30th of April. [Note these dates, p. 315.]</note>

<pb n="743"/>
the voluntary surrender of the armies of Licinius; and, thus reinforced, he meant forthwith
to have attacked Constantine.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="47">
<pb n="744"/>
<head>CHAP. XLVII.</head>
<p>So the two armies drew nigh; the trumpets gave the signal; the military ensigns advanced;
the troops of Licinius charged. But the enemies, panic-struck, could neither draw their
swords nor yet throw their javelins. Daia went about, and, alternately by entreaties and
promises, attempted to seduce the soldiers of Licinius. But he was not hearkened to in any
quarter, and they drove him back. Then were the troops of Daia slaughtered, none making
resistance; and such numerous legions, and forces so mighty, were mowed down by an inferior
enemy. No one called to mind his reputation, or former valour, or the honourable
rewards which had been conferred on him. The Supreme God did so place their necks under
the sword of their foes, that they seemed to have entered the field, not as combatants, but
as men devoted to death. After great numbers had fallen, Daia perceived that everything
went contrary to his hopes; and therefore he threw aside the purple, and having put on the
habit of a slave, hasted across the Thracian Bosphorus. One half of his army perished in
battle, and the rest either surrendered to the victor or fled; for now that the emperor himself
had deserted, there seemed to be no shame in desertion. Before the expiration of the kalends
of May, Daia arrived at Nicomedia, although distant one hundred and sixty miles from the
field of battle. So in the space of one day and two nights he performed that journey. Having
hurried away with his children and wife, and a few officers of his court, he went towards
Syria; but having been joined by some troops from those quarters, and having collected together
a part of his fugitive forces, he halted in Cappadocia, and then he resumed the imperial
garb.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="48">
<pb n="745"/>
<head>CHAP. XLVIII.</head>
<p>Not many days after the victory, Licinius, having received part of the soldiers of Daia
into his service, and properly distributed them, transported his army into Bithynia, and
having made his entry into Nicomedia, he returned thanks to God, through whose aid he
had overcome; and on the ides of June,1992 while he and Constantine were consuls for the
third time, he commanded the following edict for the restoration of the Church, directed
to the president of the province, to be promulgated:—</p>
<p>“When we, Constantine and Licinius, emperors, had an interview at Milan, and conferred
together with respect to the good and security of the commonweal, it seemed to us that,
amongst those things that are profitable to mankind in general, the reverence paid to the
Divinity merited our first and chief attention, and that it was proper that the Christians and
all others should have liberty to follow that mode of religion which to each of them appeared
best; so that that God, who is seated in heaven, might be benign and propitious to us, and
to every one under our government. And therefore we judged it a salutary measure, and
one highly consonant to right reason, that no man should be denied leave of attaching
himself to the rites of the Christians, or to whatever other religion his mind directed him,
that thus the supreme Divinity, to whose worship we freely devote ourselves, might continue
to vouchsafe His favour and beneficence to us. And accordingly we give you to know that,
without regard to any provisos in our former orders to you concerning the Christians, all
who choose that religion are to be permitted, freely and absolutely, to remain in it, and not
to be disturbed any ways, or molested. And we thought fit to be thus special in the things
committed to your charge, that you might understand that the indulgence which we have
granted in matters of religion to the Christians is ample and unconditional; and perceive at
the same time that the open and free exercise of their respective religions is granted to all
others, as well as to the Christians. For it befits the well-ordered state and the tranquillity
of our times that each individual be allowed, according to his own choice, to worship the
Divinity; and we mean not to derogate aught from the honour due to any religion or its
votaries. Moreover, with respect to the Christians, we formerly gave certain orders concerning
the places appropriated for their religious assemblies; but now we will that all persons who
have purchased such places, either from our exchequer or from any one else, do restore
them to the Christians, without money demanded or price claimed, and that this be performed
peremptorily and unambiguously; and we will also, that they who have obtained
any right to such places by form of gift do forthwith restore them to the Christians: reserving
always to such persons, who have either purchased for a price, or gratuitously acquired
them, to make application to the judge of the district, if they look on themselves as entitled
to any equivalent from our beneficence.</p>
<note type="footnote">1992 13th of June. [Note the rise of general toleration.]</note>

<pb n="746"/>
<p>“All those places are, by your intervention, to be immediately restored to the Christians.
And because it appears that, besides the places appropriated to religious worship, the
Christians did possess other places, which belonged not to individuals, but to their society
in general, that is, to their churches, we comprehend all such within the regulation aforesaid,
and we will that you cause them all to be restored to the society or churches, and that without
hesitation or controversy: Provided always, that the persons making restitution without a
price paid shall be at liberty to seek indemnification from our bounty. In furthering all which
things for the behoof of the Christians, you are to use your utmost diligence, to the end that
our orders be speedily obeyed, and our gracious purpose in securing the public tranquillity
promoted. So shall that divine favour which, in affairs of the mightiest importance, we have
already experienced, continue to give success to us, and in our successes make the commonweal
happy. And that the tenor of this our gracious ordinance may be made known unto
all, we will that you cause it by your authority to be published everywhere.”</p>
<p>Licinius having issued this ordinance, made an harangue, in which he exhorted the
Christians to rebuild their religious edifices.</p>
<p>And thus, from the overthrow of the Church until its restoration, there was a space of
ten years and about four months.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="49">

<head>CHAP. XLIX.</head>
<p>While Licinius pursued with his army, the fugitive tyrant retreated, and again occupied
the passes of mount Taurus; and there, by erecting parapets and towers, attempted to stop
the march of Licinius. But the victorious troops, by an attack made on the right, broke
through all obstacles, and Daia at length fled to Tarsus. There, being hard pressed both by
sea and land, he despaired of finding any place for refuge; and in the anguish and dismay
of his mind, he sought death as the only remedy of those calamities that God had heaped
on him. But first he gorged himself with food, and large draughts of wine, as those are wont
who believe that they eat and drink for the last time; and so he swallowed poison. However,
the force of the poison, repelled by his full stomach, could not immediately operate, but it
produced a grievous disease, resembling the pestilence; and his life was prolonged only that
his sufferings might be more severe. And now the poison began to rage, and to burn up
everything within him, so that he was driven to distraction with the intolerable pain; and
during a fit of frenzy, which lasted four days, he gathered handfuls of earth, and greedily
devoured it. Having undergone various and excruciating torments, he dashed his forehead
against the wall, and his eyes started out of their sockets. And now, become blind, he imagined
that he saw God, with His servants arrayed in white robes, sitting in judgment on him. He
roared out as men on the rack are wont, and exclaimed that not he, but others, were guilty.
In the end, as if he had been racked into confession, he acknowledged his own guilt, and
lamentably implored Christ to have mercy upon him. Then, amidst groans, like those of
one burnt alive, did he breathe out his guilty soul in the most horrible kind of death.</p>

<p>Thus did God subdue all those who persecuted His name, so that neither root nor branch
of them remained; for Licinius, as soon as he was established in sovereign authority, commanded
that Valeria should be put to death. Daia, although exasperated against her, never
ventured to do this, not even after his discomfiture and flight, and when he knew that his
end approached. Licinius commanded that Candidianus also should be put to death. He
was the son of Galerius by a concubine, and Valeria, having no children, had adopted him.
On the news of the death of Daia, she came in disguise to the court of Licinius, anxious to
observe what might befall Candidianus. The youth, presenting himself at Nicomedia, had
an outward show of honour paid to him, and, while he suspected no harm, was killed.
Hearing of this catastrophe, Valeria immediately fled. The Emperor Severus left a son,
Severianus, arrived at man’s estate, who accompanied Daia in his flight from the field of
battle. Licinius caused him to be condemned and executed, under the pretence that, on the
death of Daia, he had intentions of assuming the imperial purple. Long before this time,
Candidianus and Severianus, apprehending evil from Licinius, had chosen to remain with
Daia; while Valeria favoured Licinius, and was willing to bestow on him that which she had
denied to Daia, all rights accruing to her as the widow of Galerius. Licinius also put to death
Maximus, the son of Daia, a boy eight years old, and a daughter of Daia, who was seven
years old, and had been betrothed to Candidianus. But before their death, their mother had
been thrown into the Orontes, in which river she herself had frequently commanded chaste
women to be drowned. So, by the unerring and just judgment of God, all the impious received
according to the deeds that they had done.</p>

<p>Valeria, too, who for fifteen months had wandered under a mean garb from province
to province, was at length discovered in Thessalonica, was apprehended, together with her
mother Prisca, and suffered capital punishment. Both the ladies were conducted to execution;
a fall from grandeur which moved the pity of the multitude of beholders that the strange
sight had gathered together. They were beheaded, and their bodies cast into the sea. Thus
the chaste demeanour of Valeria, and the high rank of her and her mother, proved fatal to
both of them.1993</p>

<p>I relate all those things on the authority of well-informed persons; and I thought it
proper to commit them to writing exactly as they happened, lest the memory of events so
important should perish, and lest any future historian of the persecutors should corrupt the
truth, either by suppressing their offences against God, or the judgment of God against
them. To His everlasting mercy ought we to render thanks, that, having at length looked on
the earth, He deigned to collect again and to restore His flock, partly laid waste by ravenous
wolves, and partly scattered abroad, and to extirpate those noxious wild beasts who had
trod down its pastures, and destroyed its resting-places.1994 Where now are the surnames
of the Jovii and the Herculii, once so glorious and renowned amongst the nations; surnames
insolently assumed at first by Diocles and Maximian, and afterwards transferred to their
successors? The Lord has blotted them out and erased them from the earth. Let us therefore
with exultation celebrate the triumphs of God, and oftentimes with praises make mention
of His victory; let us in our prayers, by night and by day, beseech Him to confirm for ever
that peace which, after a warfare of ten years, He has bestowed on His own: and do you,
above all others, my best beloved Donatus, who so well deserve to be heard, implore the
Lord that it would please Him propitiously and mercifully to continue His pity towards His
servants, to protect His people from the machinations and assaults of the devil, and to guard
the now flourishing churches in perpetual felicity.</p>

<head>ELUCIDATION</head>
<p>(On the tenth of the kalends of April, p. 301.)</p>
<p>Serious difficulties are encountered by the learned in reconciling Lactantius with himself,
if, indeed, the fault be not one of his copyists rather than his own. In the fourth book of the
Institutes1995 his language is thus given by Baluzius:1996—</p>
<p>“Extremis temporibus Tiberii Cæsaris, ut scriptum legimus, Dominus noster Jesus
Christus, a Judæis cruciatus est post diem decimum kalendarum Aprilis, duobus Geminis
consulibus.”</p>
<p>Lactantius was writing in Nicomedia, and may have quoted from memory what he had
read, perhaps in the report of Pilate himself. The expression post diem decimum kalendarum
Aprilis is ambiguous: and Jarvis says, “My impression is, that it means ‘after the tenth day
before the kalends of April;’ that is, after the 23d of March.”1997</p>
<p>But here our author says, according to the accurate edition of Walchius1998 (a.d. 1715),—</p>
<p>“Exinde tetrarchas habuerunt usque ad Herodem, qui fuit sub imperio Tiberii Cæsaris:
cujus anno quinto decimo, id est duobus Geminis consulibus, ante diem septimam
Calendarum Aprilium, Judæi Christum cruci affixerunt.”</p>
<p>But here, on the authority of forty manuscripts, Du Fresnoy reads, “ante diem decimam,”
which he labours to reconcile with “post diem decimum,” as above. Jarvis adheres to the
reading septimam, supported by more than fifty manuscripts, and decides for the 23d of
March.</p>
<p>He cites Augustine to the same effect in the noted passage:1999—</p>
<p>“Ille autem mense conceptum et passum esse Christum, et Paschæ observatio et dies
ecclesiis notissimus Nativitatis ejus ostendit. Qui enim mense nono natus est octavo kalendas
Janvarias profecto mense primo conceptus est circa octavum kalendas Aprilis, quod tempus
passionis ejus fuit.”</p>
<p>This, Augustine considers to be “seething a kid in mother’s milk,” after a mystical sense;
cruelly making the cross to coincide with the maternity of the Virgin, who beheld her Son
an innocent victim on the anniversary of her salutation by the angel.</p>

<head>FRAGMENTS OF LACTANTIUS</head>
<p>I. Fear, love, joy, sadness, lust, eager desire, anger, pity, emulation, admiration,—these
motions or affections of the mind exist from the beginning of man’s creation by the Lord;
and they were usefully and advantageously introduced into human nature, that by governing
himself by these with method, and in accordance with reason, man may be able, by acting
manfully, to exercise those good qualities, by means of which he would justly have deserved
to receive from the Lord eternal life. For these affections of the mind being restrained
within their proper limits, that is, being rightly employed, produce at present good qualities,
and in the future eternal rewards. But when they advance2000 beyond their boundaries, that
is, when they turn aside to an evil course, then vices and iniquities come forth, and produce
everlasting punishments.2001</p>
<p>II. Within our memory, also, Lactantius speaks of metres,—the pentameter (he says)
and the tetrameter.2002</p>
<p>III. Firmianus, writing to Probus on the metres of comedies, thus speaks: “For as to the
question which you proposed concerning the metres of comedies, I also know that many
are of opinion that the plays of Terence in particular have not the metre of Greek comedy,—
that is, of Menander, Philemon, and Diphilus, which consist of trimeter verses; for
our ancient writers of comedies, in the modulation of their plays, preferred to follow Eupolis,
Cratinus, and Aristophanes, as has been before said.” That there is a measure—that is,
metre2003—in the plays of Terence and Plautus, and of the other comic and tragic writers,
let these declare: Cicero, Scaurus, and Firmianus.2004</p>
<p>IV. We will bring forward the sentiments of our Lactantius, which he expressed in words
in his third volume to Probus on this subject. The Gauls, he says, were from ancient times
called Galatians, from the whiteness of their body; and thus the Sibyl terms them. And this
is what the poet intended to signify when he said,—

when he might have used the word white. It is plain that from this the province was called
Galatia, in which, on their arrival in it, the Gauls united themselves with Greeks, from which
circumstance that region was called Gallogræcia, and afterwards Galatia. And it is no wonder
if he said this concerning the Galatians, and related that a people of the West, having passed
over so great a distance in the middle of the earth, settled in a region of the East.2006</p>

<head>THE PHOENIX</head>
<p>BY AN UNCERTAIN AUTHOR. ATTRIBUTED TO LACTANTIUS 2007</p>
<p>There is a happy spot, retired2008 in the first East, where the great gate of the eternal
pole lies open. It is not, however, situated near to his rising in summer or in winter, but
where the sun pours the day from his vernal chariot. There a plain spreads its open tracts;
nor does any mound rise, nor hollow valley open2009 itself. But through twice six ells that
place rises above the mountains, whose tops are thought to be lofty among us. Here is the
grove of the sun; a wood stands planted with many a tree, blooming with the honour of
perpetual foliage. When the pole had blazed with the fires of Phaethon, that place was uninjured
by the flames; and when the deluge had immersed the world in waves, it rose above
the waters of Deucalion. No enfeebling diseases, no sickly old age, nor cruel death, nor harsh
fear, approaches hither, nor dreadful crime, nor mad desire of riches, nor Mars, nor fury,
burning with the love of slaughter.2010 Bitter grief is absent, and want clothed in rags, and
sleepless cares, and violent hunger. No tempest rages there, nor dreadful violence of the
wind; nor does the hoar-frost cover the earth with cold dew. No cloud extends its fleecy2011
covering above the plains, nor does the turbid moisture of water fall from on high; but there
is a fountain in the middle, which they call by the name of “living;”2012 it is clear, gentle,
and abounding with sweet waters, which, bursting forth once during the space of each2013
month, twelve times irrigates all the grove with waters. Here a species of tree, rising with
lofty stem, bears mellow fruits not about to fall on the ground. This grove, these woods, a

single2014 bird, the phoenix, inhabits,—single, but it lives reproduced by its own death. It
obeys and submits2015 to Phoebus, a remarkable attendant. Its parent nature has given it to
possess this office. When at its first rising the saffron morn grows red, when it puts to flight
the stars with its rosy light, thrice and four times she plunges her body into the sacred waves,
thrice and four times she sips water from the living stream.2016 She is raised aloft, and takes
her seat on the highest top of the lofty tree, which alone looks down upon the whole grove;
and turning herself to the fresh risings of the nascent Phoebus, she awaits his rays and rising
beam. And when the sun has thrown back the threshold of the shining gate, and the light
gleam2017 of the first light has shone forth, she begins to pour strains of sacred song, and
to hail2018 the new light with wondrous voice, which neither the notes of the nightingale2019
nor the flute of the Muses can equal with Cyrrhæan2020 strains. But neither is it thought
that the dying swan can imitate it, nor the tuneful strings of the lyre of Mercury. After that
Phoebus has brought back his horses to the open heaven,2021 and continually advancing,
has displayed2022 his whole orb; she applauds with thrice-repeated flapping of her wings,
and having thrice adored the fire-bearing head, is silent. And she also distinguishes the swift
hours by sounds not liable to error by day and night: an overseer2023 of the groves, a venerable
priestess of the wood, and alone admitted to thy secrets, O Phoebus. And when she has now
accomplished the thousand years of her life, and length of days has rendered her burdensome,
2024 in order that she may renew the age which has glided by, the fates pressing2025
her, she flees from the beloved couch of the accustomed grove. And when she has left the
sacred places, through a desire of being born2026 again, then she seeks this world, where
death reigns. Full of years, she directs her swift flight into Syria, to which Venus herself has

given the name of Phoenice;2027 and through trackless deserts she seeks the retired groves
in the place, where a remote wood lies concealed through the glens. Then she chooses a lofty
palm, with top reaching to the heavens, which has the pleasing2028 name of phoenix from
the bird, and where2029 no hurtful living creature can break through, or slimy serpent, or
any bird of prey. Then Æolas shuts in the winds in hanging caverns, lest they should injure
the bright2030 air with their blasts, or lest a cloud collected by the south wind through the
empty sky should remove the rays of the sun, and be a hindrance2031 to the bird. Afterwards
she builds for herself either a nest or a tomb, for she perishes that she may live; yet she
produces herself. Hence she collects juices and odours, which the Assyrian gathers from the
rich wood, which the wealthy Arabian gathers; which either the Pygmæan2032 nations, or
India crops, or the Sabæan land produces from its soft bosom. Hence she heaps together
cinnamon and the odour of the far-scented amomum, and balsams with mixed leaves.
Neither the twig of the mild cassia nor of the fragrant acanthus is absent, nor the tears and
rich drop of frankincense. To these she adds tender ears2033 of flourishing spikenard, and
joins the too pleasing pastures2034 of myrrh. Immediately she places her body about to be
changed on the strewed nest, and her quiet limbs on such2035 a couch. Then with her mouth
she scatters juices around and upon her limbs, about to die with her own funeral rites. Then
amidst various odours she yields up2036 her life, nor fears the faith of so great a deposit. In
the meantime her body, destroyed by death, which proves the source of life,2037 is hot, and
the heat itself produces a flame; and it conceives fire afar off from the light of heaven: it
blazes, and is dissolved into burnt ashes. And these ashes collected in death it fuses,2038 as
it were, into a mass, and has an effect2039 resembling seed. From this an animal is said to
arise without limbs, but the worm is said to be of a milky colour. And it suddenly increases

rounded egg. After this it is formed again, such as its figure was before, and the phoenix,
having burst her shell,2041 shoots forth, even as caterpillars2042 in the fields, when they are
fastened by a thread to a stone, are wont to be changed into a butterfly. No food is appointed
for her in our world, nor does any one make it his business to feed her while unfledged. She
sips the delicate2043 ambrosial dews of heavenly nectar which have fallen from the starbearing
pole. She gathers these; with these the bird is nourished in the midst of odours,
until she bears a natural form. But when she begins to flourish with early youth, she flies
forth now about to return to her native abode. Previously, however, she encloses in an
ointment of balsam, and in myrrh and dissolved2044 frankincense, all the remains of her
own body, and the bones or ashes, and relics2045 of herself, and with pious mouth brings it
into a round form,2046 and carrying this with her feet, she goes to the rising of the sun, and
tarrying at the altar, she draws it forth in the sacred temple. She shows and presents herself
an object of admiration to the beholder; such great beauty is there, such great honour
abounds. In the first place, her colour is like the brilliancy2047 of that which the seeds of the
pomegranate when ripe take under the smooth rind;2048 such colour as is contained in the
leaves which the poppy produces in the fields, when Flora spreads her garments beneath
the blushing sky. Her shoulders and beautiful breasts shine with this covering; with this her
head, with this her neck, and the upper parts of her back shine. And her tail is extended,
varied with yellow metal, in the spots of which mingled purple blushes. Between her wings
there is a bright2049 mark above, as2050 Tris on high is wont to paint a cloud from above.
She gleams resplendent with a mingling of the green emerald, and a shining beak2051 of

pure horn opens itself. Her eyes are large;2052 you might believe that they were two
jacinths;2053 from the middle of which a bright flame shines. An irradiated crown is fitted2054
to the whole of her head, resembling on high the glory of the head of Phoebus.2055 Scales
cover her thighs spangled with yellow metal, but a rosy2056 colour paints her claws with
honour. Her form is seen to blend the figure of the peacock with that of the painted bird of
Phasis.2057 The winged creature which is produced in the lands of the Arabians, whether it
be beast or bird, can scarcely equal her magnitude.2058 She is not, however, slow, as birds
which through the greatness of their body have sluggish motions, and a very heavy2059
weight. But she is light and swift, full of royal beauty. Such she always shows herself2060 in
the sight of men. Egypt comes hither to such a wondrous2061 sight, and the exulting crowd
salutes the rare bird. Immediately they carve her image on the consecrated marble, and
mark both the occurrence and the day with a new title. Birds of every kind assemble together;
none is mindful of prey, none of fear. Attended by a chorus of birds, she flies through the
heaven, and a crowd accompanies her, exulting in the pious duty. But when she has arrived
at the regions of pure ether, she presently returns;2062 afterwards she is concealed in her
own regions. But oh, bird of happy lot and fate,2063 to whom the god himself granted to be

<head>A POEM ON THE PASSION OF THE LORD</head>
<p>FORMERLY ASCRIBED TO LACTANTIUS</p>
<p>Whoever you are who approach, and are entering the precincts2065 of the middle of the
temple, stop a little and look upon me, who, though innocent, suffered for your crime; lay
me up in your mind, keep me in your breast. I am He who, pitying the bitter misfortunes
of men, came hither as a messenger2066 of offered peace, and as a full atonement2067 for the
fault of men.2068 Here the brightest light from above is restored to the earth; here is the
merciful image of safety; here I am a rest to you, the right way, the true redemption, the
banner2069 of God, and a memorable sign of fate. It was on account of you and your life
that I entered the Virgin’s womb, was made man, and suffered a dreadful death; nor did I
find rest anywhere in the regions of the earth, but everywhere threats, everywhere labours.
First of all a wretched dwelling2070 in the land of Judæa was a shelter for me at my birth,
and for my mother with me: here first, amidst the outstretched sluggish cattle, dry grass
gave me a bed in a narrow stall. I passed my earliest years in the Pharian2071 regions, being
an exile in the reign of Herod; and after my return to Judæa I spent the rest of my years, always
engaged2072 in fastings, and the extremity of poverty itself, and the lowest circumstances;
always by healthful admonitions applying the minds of men to the pursuit of genial uprightness,
uniting with wholesome teaching many evident miracles: on which account impious
Jerusalem, harassed by the raging cares of envy and cruel hatred, and blinded by madness,
dared to seek for me, though innocent, by deadly punishment, a cruel death on the dreadful
cross. And if you yourself wish to discriminate these things more fully,2073 and if it delights
you to go through all my groans, and to experience griefs with me, put together2074 the
designs and plots, and the impious price of my innocent blood, and the pretended kisses of
a disciple,2075 and the insults and strivings of the cruel multitude; and, moreover, the blows,

accursed2077 judgment of the blinded Pilate, and the immense cross pressing my shoulders
and wearied back, and my painful steps to a dreadful death. Now survey me from head to
foot, deserted as I am, and lifted up afar from my beloved mother. Behold and see my locks
clotted with blood, and my blood-stained neck under my very hair, and my head drained2078
with cruel thorns, and pouring down like rain2079 from all sides a stream2080 of blood over
my divine face. Survey my compressed and sightless eyes, and my afflicted cheeks; see my
parched tongue poisoned with gall, and my countenance pale with death. Behold my hands
pierced with nails, and my arms drawn out, and the great wound in my side; see the blood
streaming from it, and my perforated2081 feet, and blood-stained limbs. Bend your knee,
and with lamentation adore the venerable wood of the cross, and with lowly countenance
stooping2082 to the earth, which is wet with innocent blood, sprinkle it with rising tears,
and at times2083 bear me and my admonitions in your devoted heart. Follow the footsteps

pangs of body and soul, learn to endure hardships,2084 and to watch over your own
safety. These memorials,2085 if at any time you find pleasure in thinking over them, if in
your mind there is any confidence to bear anything like my sufferings),2086 if the piety due,
and gratitude worthy of my labours shall arise, will be incitements2087 to true virtue, and
they will be shields against the snares of an enemy, aroused2088 by which you will be safe,
and as a conqueror bear off the palm in every contest. If these memorials shall turn away
your senses, which are devoted to a perishable2089 world, from the fleeting shadow of earthly
beauty, the result will be, that you will not venture,2090 enticed by empty hope, to trust the

<p>There is no ms authority for ascribing the above to Lactantius. “It does not, in the least,
come up to the purity and eloquence of his style,” says Dupin; and the same candid author
notes the “adoration of the cross” as fatal to any such claim.2098</p>
<p>Of the following poem, on Easter, Dupin says: “It is attributed to Venantius upon the
testimony of some mss. in the Vatican Library.” This writer became known to Gregory of
Tours, who died about a.d. 595, and seems to have succeeded him as bishop, dying soon
after. Bede quotes his verse on St. Alban,2099—
<lg>
<l>“Albanum egregium fecunda Britannia profert,”</l>
</lg>
but styles him “presbyter Fortunatus.” He was the author of a poem on St. Martin, and another,
In Laude Virginum. His works were edited by Brouverius, a Jesuit.</p>

<p>The seasons blush varied with the flowery, fair weather6, and the gate of the pole lies
open with greater light. His path in the heaven raises the fire-breathing7 sun higher, who
goes forth on his course,8 and enters the waters of the ocean. Armed with rays traversing
the liquid elements, in this9 brief night he stretches out the day in a circle. The brilliant
firmament10 puts forth its clear countenance, and the bright stars show their joy. The
fruitful earth pours forth its gifts with varied increase,11 when the year has well returned its
vernal riches.12 Soft beds of violets paint the purple plain; the meadows are green with
plants,13 and the plant shines with its leaves. By degrees gleaming brightness of the flowers14
comes forth; all the herbs smile with their blossoms.15 The seed being deposited, the corn
springs up far and wide16 in the fields, promising to be able to overcome the hunger of the
husbandman. Having deserted its stem, the vine-shoot bewails its joys; the vine gives water
only from the source from which it is wont to give wine. The swelling bud, rising with tender
down from the back of its mother, prepares its bosom for bringing forth. Its foliage17 having
been torn off in the wintry season, the verdant grove now renews its leafy shelter. Mingled
together, the willow, the fir, the hazel, the osier,18 the elm, the maple, the walnut, each tree

hive, humming over the flowers, carries off honey with its leg. The bird which, having closed
its song, was dumb, sluggish with the wintry cold, returns to its strains. Hence Philomela
attunes her notes with her own instruments,19 and the air becomes sweeter with the reechoed
melody. Behold, the favour of the reviving world bears witness that all gifts have
returned together with its Lord. For in honour of Christ rising triumphant after His descent
to the gloomy Tartarus, the grove on every side with its leaves expresses approval, the plants
with their flowers express approval.20 The light, the heaven, the fields, and the sea duly
praise the God ascending above the stars, having crushed the laws of hell. Behold, He who
was crucified reigns as God over all things, and all created objects offer prayer to their Creator.
Hail, festive day, to be reverenced throughout the world,21 on which God has conquered
hell, and gains the stars! The changes of the year and of the months, the bounteous light of
the days, the splendour of the hours, all things with voice applaud.22 Hence, in honour of
you, the wood with its foliage applauds; hence the vine, with its silent shoot, gives thanks.

heapest together the soil, Thou dost pour forth the seas, by whose27 government all things
which are fixed in their places flourish. Who seeing that the human race was plunged in the

born and to die. Thou dost undergo30 funeral obsequies, Thyself the author of life and
framer of the world, Thou dost enter31 the path of death, in giving the aid of salvation. The
gloomy chains of the infernal law yielded, and chaos feared to be pressed by the presence32
of the light. Darkness perishes, put to flight by the brightness of Christ; the thick pall of
eternal33 night falls. But restore the promised34 pledge, I pray Thee, O power benign! The
third day has returned; arise, my buried One; it is not becoming that Thy limbs should lie
in the lowly sepulchre, nor that worthless stones should press that which is the ransom35 of
the world. It is unworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining36 rock, and cover Him
in whose fist37 all things are enclosed. Take away the linen clothes, I pray; leave the napkins
in the tomb: Thou art sufficient for us, and without Thee there is nothing. Release the chained
shades of the infernal prison, and recall to the upper regions38 whatever sinks to the lowest
depths. Give back Thy face, that the world may see the light; give back the day which flees
from us at Thy death. But returning, O holy conqueror! Thou didst altogether fill the heaven!
39 Tartarus lies depressed, nor retains its rights. The ruler of the lower regions, insatiably
opening his hollow jaws, who has always been a spoiler, becomes40 a prey to Thee. Thou
rescuest an innumerable people from the prison of death, and they follow in freedom to the
place whither their leader41 approaches. The fierce monster in alarm vomits forth the multitude
whom he had swallowed up, and the Lamb42 withdraws the sheep from the jaw of
the wolf. Hence re-seeking the tomb from the lower regions,43 having resumed Thy flesh,
as a warrior Thou carriest back ample trophies to the heavens. Those whom chaos held in
punishment44 he45 has now restored; and those whom death might seek, a new life holds.

Oh, sacred King, behold a great part of Thy triumph shines forth, when the sacred laver
blesses pure souls! A host, clad in white,46 come forth from the bright waves, and cleanse
their old47 fault in a new stream. The white garment also designates bright souls, and the
shepherd has enjoyments from the snow-white flock. The priest Felix is added sharing48 in
this reward, who wishes to give double talents to his Lord. Drawing those who wander in
Gentile error to better things, that a beast of prey may not carry them away, He guards the
fold of God. Those whom guilty Eve had before infected, He now restores, fed49 with
abundant milk at the bosom of the Church. By cultivating rustic hearts with mild conversations,
a crop is produced from a briar by the bounty of Felix. The Saxon, a fierce nation,
living as it were after the manner of wild beasts, when you, O sacred One! apply a remedy,
the beast of prey resembles50 the sheep. About to remain with you through an age with the
return51 of a hundred-fold, you fill the barns with the produce of an abundant harvest. May
this people, free from stain, be strengthened52 in your arms, and may you bear to the stars
a pure pledge to God. May one crown be bestowed on you from on high gained from yourself53,
may another flourish gained from your people.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE</head>
<p>[Circa a.d. 232] Finding these fragments relegated, by the Edinburgh editors, to a place
(unaccountably chosen) among the spurious Decretals54 and dismissed as of dubious
character, it looked as if modern light had been shed upon this author, and as if he had
better, perhaps, be classed with the apocryphal works of our concluding volume. But, after
considerable inquiry, I see no reason to dismiss Asterius from the respectable position assigned
him by Lardner;55 and I now wish I had appended these fragments to those of the
Roman presbyter Caius, to which the reader is referred.56 It is true, Lardner is quite undecided
as to this author, though he accepts Tillemont’s conjecture as probable; viz., that the Asterius
Urbanus mentioned by Eusebius is the author of the fragments, and that his work against
the Montanists was written in the eleventh year of the Emperor Alexander, circa 232. It is
doubtful whether the author was a presbyter or a bishop. On some occasions he seems to
have been at Ancyra in Galatia, where he reluctantly consented to write is treatise at the
solicitation of the presbytery there, and particularly of Abercius57 Marcellus, to whom it is
inscribed.</p>
<p>The translator is not named, but here follows the very unsatisfactory preface of the Edinburgh
edition:—</p>
<p>Nothing is known of Asterius Urbanus. The name occurs in Fragment IV.;58 and from
the allusion made to him there, some have inferred that he was the author of the work against
Montanists, from which Eusebius has made these extracts. The inference is unfounded.
There is no clue to the authorship. It has been attributed by different critics to Apollinaris,
Apollonius, and Rhodon.</p>

<head>THE EXTANT WRITINGS OF ASTERIUS URBANUS59</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>I. THE EXORDIUM.</head>
<p>Having now for a very long and surely a very sufficient period had the charge pressed
upon me by thee, my dear Avircius60 Marcellus, to write some sort of treatise against the
heresy that bears the name of Miltiades,61 I have somehow been very doubtfully disposed
toward the task up till now; not that I felt any difficulty in refuting the falsehood, and in
bearing my testimony to the truth, but that I was apprehensive and fearful lest I should appear
to any to be adding some new word or precept62 to the doctrine of the Gospel of the New
Testament, with respect to which indeed it is not possible for one who has chosen to have
his manner of life in accordance with the Gospel itself, either to add anything to it or to take
away anything from it. Being recently, however, at Ancyra, a town of Galatia, and finding
the church in Pontus63 greatly agitated64 by this new prophecy, as they call it, but which
should rather be called this false prophecy, as shall be shown presently, I discoursed to the
best of my ability, with the help of God, for many days in the church, both on these subjects
and on various others65 which were brought under my notice by them. And this I did in
such manner that the church rejoiced and was strengthened in the truth, while the adversaries66
were forthwith routed, and the opponents put to grief. And the presbyters of the place
accordingly requested us to leave behind us some memorandum of the things which we al-

heresy of the Cataphrygians, and some consequently have conjectured that we should read here Alcibiades, as

<head>II. FROM BOOK I.</head>
<p>Now the attitude of opposition68 which they have assumed, and this new heresy of theirs
which puts them in a position of separation from the Church, had their origin in the following
manner. There is said to be a certain village called Ardaba69 in the Mysia, which touches
Phrygia.70 There, they say, one of those who had been but recently converted to the faith,
a person of the name of Montanus, when Gratus was proconsul of Asia, gave the adversary
entrance against himself by the excessive lust of his soul after taking the lead. And this person
was carried away in spirit;71 and suddenly being seized with a kind of frenzy and ecstasy,
he raved, and began to speak and to utter strange things, and to prophesy in a manner
contrary to the custom of the Church, as handed down from early times and preserved
thenceforward in a continuous succession. And among those who were present on that occasion,
and heard those spurious utterances, there were some who were indignant, and rebuked
him as one frenzied, and under the power of demons, and possessed by the spirit of
delusion, and agitating the multitude, and debarred him from speaking any more; for they
were mindful of the Lord’s distinction72 and threatening, whereby He warned them to be
on their guard vigilantly against the coming of the false prophets. But there were others too,
who, as if elated by the Holy Spirit and the prophetic gift, and not a little puffed up, and
forgetting entirely the Lord’s distinction, challenged the maddening and insidious and seductive
spirit, being themselves cajoled and misled by him, so that there was no longer any
checking him to silence.73 And thus by a kind of artifice, or rather by such a process of craft,
the devil having devised destruction against those who were disobedient to the Lord’s
warning, and being unworthily honoured by them, secretly excited and inflamed their minds
that had already left the faith which is according to truth, in order to play the harlot with

so that they too spoke in a frenzy and unseasonably, and in a strange manner, like the person
already mentioned, while the spirit called them happy as they rejoiced and exulted proudly
at his working, and puffed them up by the magnitude of his promises; while, on the other
hand, at times also he condemned them skilfully and plausibly, in order that he might seem
to them also to have the power of reproof.75 And those few who were thus deluded were
Phrygians. But the same arrogant spirit taught them to revile the Church universal under
heaven, because that false spirit of prophecy found neither honour from it nor entrance into
it. For when the faithful throughout Asia met together often and in many places of Asia for
deliberation on this subject, and subjected those novel doctrines to examination, and declared
them to be spurious, and rejected them as heretical, they were in consequence of that expelled
from the Church and debarred from communion.76</p>

<p>Wherefore, since they stigmatized us as slayers of the prophets77 because we did not
receive their loquacious78 prophets,—for they say that these are they whom the Lord
promised to send to the people,—let them answer us in the name of God, and tell us, O
friends, whether there is any one among those who began to speak from Montanus and the
women onward that was persecuted by the Jews or put to death by the wicked? There is not
one. Not even one of them is there who was seized and crucified for the name79 of Christ.
No; certainly not. Neither assuredly was there one of these women who was ever scourged
in the synagogues of the Jews, or stoned. No; never anywhere. It is indeed by another kind
of death that Montanus and Maximilla are said to have met their end. For the report is, that
by the instigation of that maddening spirit both of them hung themselves; not together indeed,
but at the particular time of the death of each80 as the common story goes. And thus

of old by the Lord, that when the Spirit came He would convince or reprove the world of sin; and hence this
false spirit, with the view of confirming his hearers in the belief that he was the true Spirit of God, sometimes
rebuked and condemned them. See a passage in Ambrose’s Epistle to the Thessal., ch. v. (Migne).</note>

they died, and finished their life like the traitor Judas. Thus, also, the general report gives it
that Theodotus—that astonishing person who was, so to speak, the first procurator81 of
their so-called prophecy, and who, as if he were sometime taken up and received into the
heavens, fell into spurious ecstasies,82 and gave himself wholly over to the spirit of delusion—
was at last tossed by him83 into the air, and met his end miserably. People say then
that this took place in the way we have stated. But as we did not see84 them ourselves, we
do not presume to think that we know any of these things with certainty. And it may
therefore have been in this way perhaps, and perhaps in some other way, that Montanus

let him constrain to a confession those who were present at that time for the very purpose
of trying and holding converse with the talkative spirit—those men so highly reputed as
men and bishops—namely, Zoticus of the village of Comana86, and Julian of Apamea, whose

from being confuted by them.</p>

<p>But as they have been refuted in all their allegations, and are thus at a loss what to say,
they try to take refuge in their martyrs. For they say that they have many martyrs, and that
this is a sure proof of the power of their so-called prophetic spirit. But this allegation, as it
seems, carries not a whit more truth with it than the others. For indeed some of the other
heresies have also a great multitude of martyrs; but yet certainly we shall not on that account
agree with them, neither shall we acknowledge that they have truth in them. And those first
heretics, who from the heresy of Marcion are called Marcionites, allege that they have a

<p>Hence, also, whenever those who have been called to martyrdom for the true faith by
the Church happen to fall in with any of those so-called martyrs of the Phrygian heresy,
they always separate from them, and die without having fellowship with them, because they
do not choose to give their assent to the spirit of Montanus and the women. And that this
is truly the case, and that it has actually taken place in our own times at Apamea, a town on

<head>ELUCIDATION.</head>
<p>(Aviricius Marcellus, p. 335, supra)</p>
<p>Like his great predecessor in Patristic research (Bishop Pearson), the learned and indefatigable
Bishop Lightfoot will leave us gold-dust in the mere sweepings of his literary
work. His recent voluminous edition of the Apostolic Fathers93 is encyclopedic in its treatment
of the subject; and I had hardly corrected the last proofs of the fragments ascribed to Asterius
Urbanus when I discovered, in one of his notes on Polycarp, a most brilliant elucidation of
a matter which I had supposed involved in twofold obscurity. Asterius is a mere name embedded
in Eusebius, and in his fragments there preserved is embedded the yet obscurer
name of Aviricius Marcellus, which the reader will find, with its various spellings, in one of
the translator’s notes.94 Who could have supposed that even the learning and ingenuity of
Lightfoot could fish out of very dark waters such shining booty as fills the network about
“Abercius of Hierapolis?” While he does not even name Asterius, the mere nominis umbra
of Aviricius Marcellus is material for a truly remarkable dissertation covering nine pages of
fine print, and enabling us to conclude that this Aviricius is none other than the same
“bishop of Hierapolis” about whom there is such a long story in the Bollandist Acta Sanctorum
95 The story is a silly legend, but Lightfoot understands the art ex fumo dare lucem; and
any one who enjoys following up such elaborations will find most curious and delightful
reading in the pages to which I have referred. Our Aviricius, then, was bishop of “Hierapolis
of Lesser Phrygia,” not of Hierapolis on the Mæander, and flourished about a.d.163, during
the reign of M. Aurelius. This date, therefore, must correct the conjecture of Tillemont and
the date which I had accepted from him on the authority of Dr. Lardner.96</p>

<head>ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD97</head>
<p>To me, as I meditate and consider in my mind concerning the creation of this world in
which we are kept enclosed, even such is the rapidity of that creation; as is contained in the
book of Moses, which he wrote about its creation, and which is called Genesis. God produced
that entire mass for the adornment of His majesty in six days; on the seventh to which He
consecrated it . . . with a blessing. For this reason, therefore, because in the septenary number
of days both heavenly and earthly things are ordered, in place of the beginning I will consider
of this seventh day after the principle of all matters pertaining to the number of seven; and
as far as I shall be able, I will endeavour to portray the day of the divine power to that consummation.</p>
<p>In the beginning God made the light, and divided it in the exact measure of twelve hours
by day and by night, for this reason, doubtless, that day might bring over the night as an
occasion of rest for men’s labours; that, again, day might overcome, and thus that labour
might be refreshed with this alternate change of rest, and that repose again might be tempered
by the exercise of day. “On the fourth day He made two lights in the heaven, the greater and
the lesser, that the one might rule over the day, the other over the night,”98—the lights of
the sun and moon and He placed the rest of the stars in heaven, that they might shine upon
the earth, and by their positions distinguish the seasons, and years, and months, and days,
and hours.</p>
<p>Now is manifested the reason of the truth why the fourth day is called the Tetras, why
we fast even to the ninth hour, or even to the evening, or why there should be a passing over
even to the next day. Therefore this world of ours is composed of four elements—fire, water,
heaven, earth. These four elements, therefore, form the quaternion of times or seasons. The
sun, also, and the moon constitute throughout the space of the year four seasons—of spring,
summer, autumn, winter; and these seasons make a quaternion. And to proceed further still
from that principle, lo, there are four living creatures before God’s throne,99 four Gospels,
four rivers flowing in paradise;100 four generations of people from Adam to Noah, from

Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Christ the Lord, the Son of
God; and four living creatures, viz., a man, a calf, a lion, an eagle; and four rivers, the Pison,
the Gihon, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. The man Christ Jesus, the originator of these things
whereof we have above spoken, was taken prisoner by wicked hands, by a quaternion of
soldiers. Therefore on account of His captivity by a quaternion, on account of the majesty
of His works,—that the seasons also, wholesome to humanity, joyful for the harvests, tranquil
for the tempests, may roll on,—therefore we make the fourth day a station or a supernumerary
fast.</p>
<p>On the fifth day the land and water brought forth their progenies. On the sixth day the
things that were wanting were created; and thus God raised up man from the soil, as lord
of all the things which He created upon the earth and the water. Yet He created angels and
archangels before He created man, placing spiritual beings before earthly ones. For light
was made before sky and the earth. This sixth day is called parasceve,101 that is to say, the
preparation of the kingdom. For He perfected Adam, whom He made after His image and
likeness. But for this reason He completed His works before He created angels and fashioned
man, lest perchance they should falsely assert that they had been His helpers. On this day
also, on account of the passion of the Lord Jesus Christ, we make either a station to God,
or a fast. On the seventh day He rested from all His works, and blessed it, and sanctified it.
On the former day we are accustomed to fast rigorously, that on the Lord’s day we may go
forth to our bread with giving of thanks. And let the parasceve become a rigorous fast, lest
we should appear to observe any Sabbath with the Jews, which Christ Himself, the Lord of
the Sabbath, says by His prophets that “His soul hateth;”102 which Sabbath He in His body
abolished, although, nevertheless, He had formerly Himself commanded Moses that circumcision
should not pass over the eighth day, which day very frequently happens on the Sabbath,
as we read written in the Gospel.103 Moses, foreseeing the hardness of that people, on the
Sabbath raised up his hands, therefore, and thus figuratively fastened himself to a cross.104
And in the battle they were sought for by the foreigners on the Sabbath-day, that they might
be taken captive, and, as if by the very strictness of the law, might be fashioned to the
avoidance of its teaching.105</p>
<p>And thus in the sixth Psalm for the eighth day,106 David asks the Lord that He would
not rebuke him in His anger, nor judge him in His fury; for this is indeed the eighth day of

that future judgment, which will pass beyond the order of the sevenfold arrangement. Jesus
also, the son of Nave, the successor of Moses, himself broke the Sabbath-day; for on the
Sabbath-day he commanded the children of Israel107 to go round the walls of the city of
Jericho with trumpets, and declare war against the aliens. Matthias108 also, prince of Judah,
broke the Sabbath; for he slew the prefect of Antiochus the king of Syria on the Sabbath,
and subdued the foreigners by pursuing them. And in Matthew we read, that it is written
Isaiah also and the rest of his colleagues broke the Sabbath109—that that true and just Sabbath
should be observed in the seventh millenary of years. Wherefore to those seven days the
Lord attributed to each a thousand years; for thus went the warning: “In Thine eyes, O Lord,
a thousand years are as one day.”110 Therefore in the eyes of the Lord each thousand of
years is ordained, for I find that the Lord’s eyes are seven.111 Wherefore, as I have narrated,
that true Sabbath will be in the seventh millenary of years, when Christ with His elect shall
reign. Moreover, the seven heavens agree with those days; for thus we are warned: “By the
word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the powers of them by the spirit of His
mouth.”112 There are seven spirits. Their names are the spirits which abode on the Christ
of God, as was intimated in Isaiah the prophet: “And there rests upon Him the spirit of
wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of wisdom113 and
of piety, and the spirit of God’s fear hath filled Him.”114 Therefore the highest heaven is the
heaven of wisdom; the second, of understanding; the third, of counsel; the fourth, of might;
the fifth, of knowledge; the sixth, of piety; the seventh, of God’s fear. From this, therefore,
the thunders bellow, the lightnings are kindled,115 the fires are heaped together; fiery darts116
appear, stars gleam, the anxiety caused by the dreadful comet is aroused.117 Sometimes it
happens that the sun and moon approach one another, and cause those more than frightful
appearances, radiating with light in the field of their aspect. But the author of the whole
creation is Jesus. His name is the Word; for thus His Father says: “My heart hath emitted a
good word.”118 John the evangelist thus says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the

things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made that was made.”119 Therefore,
first, was made the creation; secondly, man, the lord of the human race, as says the apostle.120
Therefore this Word, when it made light, is called Wisdom; when it made the sky, Understanding;

<p>Now, therefore, you may see that it is being told you of the unerring glory of God in
providence; yet, as far as my small capacity shall be able, I will endeavour to set it forth. That
He might re-create that Adam by means of the week, and bring aid to His entire creation,
was accomplished by the nativity of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Who, then, that is taught
in the law of God, who that is filled with the Holy Spirit, does not see in his heart, that on
the same day on which the dragon seduced Eve, the angel Gabriel brought the glad tidings
to the Virgin Mary; that on the same day the Holy Spirit overflowed the Virgin Mary, on
which He made light; that on that day He was incarnate in flesh, in which He made the land
and water; that on the same day He was put to the breast, on which He made the stars; that
on the same day He was circumcised,139 on which the land and water brought forth their
offspring; that on the same day He was incarnated, on which He formed man out of the
ground; that on the same day Christ was born, on which He formed man; that on that day
He suffered, on which Adam fell; that on the same day He rose again from the dead, on
which He created light? He, moreover, consummates His humanity in the number seven:
of His nativity, His infancy, His boyhood, His youth, His young-manhood, His mature age,
His death. I have also set forth His humanity to the Jews in these manners: since He is
hungry, is thirsty; since He gave food and drink; since He walks, and retired; since He slept
upon a pillow;140 since, moreover, He walks upon the stormy seas with His feet, He commands
the winds, He cures the sick and restores the lame, He raises the blind by His
speech,141—see ye that He declares Himself to them to be the Lord.</p>
<p>The day, as I have above related, is divided into two parts by the number twelve—by
the twelve hours of day and night; and by these hours too, months, and years, and seasons,
and ages are computed. Therefore, doubtless, there are appointed also twelve angels of the
day and twelve angels of the night, in accordance, to wit, with the number of hours. For
these are the twenty-four witnesses of the days and nights142 which sit before the throne of
God, having golden crowns on their heads, whom the Apocalypse of John the apostle and
evangelist calls elders, for the reason that they are older both than the other angels and than
men.</p>

things which must shortly come to pass, and signified it. Blessed are they who read and hear
the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written.”<del status="error"> The</del> beginning of the
book promises blessing to him that reads and hears and keeps, that he who takes pains about
the reading may thence learn to do works, and may keep the precepts.</p>
<p>4. “Grace unto you, and peace, from Him which is, and which was, and which is to
come.”<del status="error"> He</del> is, because He endures continually; He was, because with the Father He made
all things, and has at this time taken a beginning from the Virgin; He is to come, because
assuredly He will come to judgment.</p>
<p>“And from the seven spirits which are before His throne.”<del status="error"> We</del> read of a sevenfold
spirit in Isaiah,143—namely, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel
and might, of knowledge and of piety, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>5. “And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first-begotten of the dead.”<del status="error">
In </del>taking upon Him manhood, He gave a testimony in the world, wherein also having
suffered, He freed us by His blood from sin; and having vanquished hell, He was the first
who rose from the dead, and “death shall have no more dominion over Him,”144 but by His
own reign the kingdom of the world is destroyed.</p>
<p>6. “And He made us a kingdom and priests unto God and His Father.”<del status="error"> That</del> is to say,
a Church of all believers; as also the Apostle Peter says: “A holy nation, a royal priesthood.”145</p>
<p>7. “Behold, He shall come with clouds, and every eye shall see Him.”] For He who at
first came hidden in the manhood that He had undertaken, shall after a little while come to
judgment manifest in majesty and glory. And what saith He?</p>
<p>12. “And I turned, and saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven
golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of man.”<del status="error"> He</del> says that He was like Him after His
victory over death, when He had ascended into the heavens, after the union in His body of
the power which He received from the Father with the spirit of His glory.</p>
<p>13. “As it were the Son of man walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks.”<del status="error"> He</del>
says, in the midst of the churches, as it is said in Solomon, “I will walk in the midst of the
paths of the just,”146 whose antiquity is immortality, and the fountain of majesty.</p>

<p>“Clothed with a garment down to the ankles.”<del status="error"> In </del>the long, that is, the priestly garment,
these words very plainly deliver the flesh which was not corrupted in death, and has the
priesthood through suffering.</p>
<p>“And He was girt about the paps with a golden girdle.”<del status="error"> His</del> paps are the two testaments,
and the golden girdle is the choir of saints, as gold tried in the fire. Otherwise the golden
girdle bound around His breast indicates the enlightened conscience, and the pure and
spiritual apprehension that is given to the churches.</p>
<p>14. “And His head and His hairs were white as it were white wool, and as it were snow.”<del status="error">
On</del> the head the whiteness is shown; “but the head of Christ is God.”147 In the white hairs
is the multitude of abbots148 like to wool, in respect of simple sheep; to snow, in respect of
the innumerable crowd of candidates taught from heaven.
“His eyes were as a flame of fire.”<del status="error"> God’s</del> precepts are those which minister light to believers,
but to unbelievers burning.<gap reason=" omitted"/></p>
<p>16. “And in His face was brightness as the sun.”<del status="error"> That</del> which He called brightness was
the appearance of that in which He spoke to men face to face. But the glory of the sun is less
than the glory of the Lord. Doubtless on account of its rising and setting, and rising again,
that He was born and suffered and rose again, therefore the Scripture gave this similitude,
likening His face to the glory of the sun.</p>
<p>15. “His feet were like unto yellow brass, as if burned in a furnace.”<del status="error"> He</del> calls the apostles
His feet, who, being wrought by suffering, preached His word in the whole world; for He
rightly named those by whose means the preaching went forth, feet. Whence also the
prophet anticipated this, and said: “We will worship in the place where His feet have
stood.”149 Because where they first of all stood and confirmed the Church, that is, in Judea,
all the saints shall assemble together, and will worship their Lord.</p>
<p>16. “And out of His mouth was issuing a sharp two-edged sword.”<del status="error"> By</del> the twicesharpened
sword going forth out of His mouth is shown, that it is He Himself who has both
now declared the word of the Gospel, and previously by Moses declared the knowledge of
the law to the whole world. But because from the same word, as well of the New as of the
Old Testament, He will assert Himself upon the whole human race, therefore He is spoken
of as two-edged. For the sword arms the soldier, the sword slays the enemy, the sword
punishes the deserter. And that He might show to the apostles that He was announcing
judgment, He says: “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”150 And after He had completed
His parables, He says to them: “Have ye understood all these things? And they said, We

have. And He added, Therefore is every scribe instructed in the kingdom of God like unto
a man that is a father of a family, bringing forth from his treasure things new and
old,”151—the new, the evangelical words of the apostles; the old, the precepts of the law and
the prophets: and He testified that these proceeded out of His mouth. Moreover, He also
says to Peter: “Go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that shall first come
up; and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater (that is, two denarii), and thou
shalt give it for me and for thee.”152 And similarly David says by the Spirit: “God spake
once, twice I have heard the same.”153 Because God once decreed from the beginning what
shall be even to the end. Finally, as He Himself is the Judge appointed by the Father, on account
of His assumption of humanity, wishing to show that men shall be judged by the word
that He had declared, He says: “Think ye that I will judge you at the last day? Nay, but the
word,” says He, “which I have spoken unto you, that shall judge you in the last day.”154 And
Paul, speaking of Antichrist to the Thessalonians, says: “Whom the Lord Jesus will slay by
the breath of His mouth.”155 And Isaiah says: “By the breath of His lips He shall slay the
wicked.”156 This, therefore, is the two-edged sword issuing out of His mouth.</p>
<p>15. “And His voice as it were the voice of many waters.”] The many waters are understood
to be many peoples, or the gift of baptism that He sent forth by the apostles, saying: “Go ye,
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.”157</p>
<p>16. “And He had in His right hand seven stars.”] He said that in His right hand He had
seven stars, because the Holy Spirit of sevenfold agency was given into His power by the
Father. As Peter exclaimed to the Jews: “Being at the right hand of God exalted, He hath
shed forth this Spirit received from the Father, which ye both see and hear.”158 Moreover,
John the Baptist had also anticipated this, by saying to his disciples: “For God giveth not
the Spirit by measure unto Him. The Father,” says he, “loveth the Son, and hath given all
things into His hands.”159 Those seven stars are the seven churches, which he names in his
addresses by name, and calls them to whom he wrote epistles. Not that they are themselves
the only, or even the principal churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are

in no respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to the larger number
of similar small ones. In the whole world Paul taught that all the churches are arranged by
sevens, that they are called seven, and that the Catholic Church is one. And first of all, indeed,
that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did not exceed that
number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Ephesians,
to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual
persons, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And abridging in a short space
his announcement, he thus says to Timothy: “That thou mayest know how thou oughtest
to behave thyself in the Church of the living God.”160 We read also that this typical number
is announced by the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Isaiah: “Of seven women which took hold
of one man.”161 The one man is Christ, not born of seed; but the seven women are seven
churches, receiving His bread, and clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach
should be taken away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the
Holy Spirit, which nourishes to eternal life, promised to them, that is, by faith. And His
garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are the glory of immortality, of which Paul
the apostle says: “For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
on immortality.”162 Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be taken away—that is, that
they may be cleansed from their sins: for the reproach is the original sin which is taken away
in baptism, and they begin to be called Christian men, which is, “Let thy name be called
upon us.” Therefore in these seven churches, of one Catholic Church are believers, because
it is one in seven by the quality of faith and election. Whether writing to them who labour
in the world, and live163 of the frugality of their labours, and are patient, and when they see
certain men in the Church wasters, and pernicious, they hear them, lest there should become
dissension, he yet admonishes them by love, that in what respects their faith is deficient
they should repent; or to those who dwell in cruel places among persecutors, that they should
continue faithful; or to those who, under the pretext of mercy, do unlawful sins in the
Church, and make them manifest to be done by others; or to those that are at ease in the
Church; or to those who are negligent, and Christians only in name; or to those who are
meekly instructed, that they may bravely persevere in faith; or to those who study the
Scriptures, and labour to know the mysteries of their announcement, and are unwilling to
do God’s work that is mercy and love: to all he urges penitence, to all he declares judgment.</p>

<head>FROM THE SECOND CHAPTER.</head>
<p>2. “I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience.”] In the first epistle He speaks
thus: I know that thou sufferest and workest, I see that thou art patient; think not that I am
staying long from thee.</p>
<p>“And that thou canst not bear them that are evil, and who say that they are Jews and
are not, and thou has found them liars, and thou hast patience for My name’s sake.”] All
these things tend to praise, and that no small praise; and it behoves such men, and such a
class, and such elected persons, by all means to be admonished, that they may not be defrauded
of such privileges granted to them of God. These few things He said that He had
against them.</p>
<p>4, 5. “And thou hast left thy first love: remember whence thou hast fallen.”] He who
falls, falls from a height: therefore He said whence: because, even to the very last, works of
love must be practised; and this is the principal commandment. Finally, unless this is done,
He threatened to remove their candlestick out of its place, that is, to disperse the congregation.</p>
<p>6. “This thou hast also, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes.”] But because
thou thyself hatest those who hold the doctrines of the Nicolaitanes, thou expectest praise.
Moreover, to hate the works of the Nicolaitanes, which He Himself also hated, this tends
to praise. But the works of the Nicolaitanes were in that time false and troublesome men,
who, as ministers under the name of Nicolaus, had made for themselves a heresy, to the effect
that what had been offered to idols might be exorcised and eaten, and that whoever should
have committed fornication might receive peace on the eighth day. Therefore He extols
those to whom He is writing; and to these men, being such and so great, He promised the
tree of life, which is in the paradise of His God.</p>
<p>The following epistle unfolds the mode of life and habit of another order which follows.
He proceeds to say:—</p>
<p>9. “I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich.”] For He knows that with
such men there are riches hidden with Him, and that they deny the blasphemy of the Jews,
who say that they are Jews and are not; but they are the synagogue of Satan, since they are
gathered together by Antichrist; and to them He says:—</p>
<p>10. “Be thou faithful unto death.”] That they should continue to be faithful even unto
death.</p>
<p>11. “He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.”] That is, he shall
not be chastised in hell.</p>
<p>The third order of the saints shows that they are men who are strong in faith, and who
are not afraid of persecution; but because even among them there are some who are inclined
to unlawful associations, He says:—</p>

<pb n="790"/>
<p>14–16. “Thou hast there some who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught in the case
of Balak that he should put a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat and to
commit fornication. So also hast thou them who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes; but
I will fight with them with the sword of my mouth.”] That is, I will say what I shall command,
and I will tell you what you shall do. For Balaam,164 with his doctrine, taught Balak to cast
a stumbling-block before the eyes of the children of Israel, to eat what was sacrificed to idols,
and to commit fornication,—a thing which is known to have happened of old. For he gave
this advice to the king of the Moabites, and they caused stumbling to the people. Thus, says
He, ye have among you those who hold such doctrine; and under the pretext of mercy, you
would corrupt others.</p>
<p>17. “To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna, and I will give him a white
stone.”] The hidden manna is immortality; the white gem is adoption to be the son of God;
the new name written on the stone is “Christian.”</p>
<p>The fourth class intimates the nobility of the faithful, who labour daily, and do greater
works. But even among them also He shows that there are men of an easy disposition to
grant unlawful peace, and to listen to new forms of prophesying; and He reproves and warns
the others to whom this is not pleasing, who know the wickedness opposed to them: for
which evils He purposes to bring upon the head of the faithful both sorrows and dangers;
and therefore He says:—</p>
<p>24. “I will not put upon you any other burden.”] That is, I have not given you laws, observances,
and duties, which is another burden.</p>
<p>25, 26. “But that which ye have, hold fast until I come; and he that overcometh, to him
will I give power over all peoples.”] That is, him I will appoint as judge among the rest of
the saints.</p>
<p>28. “And I will give him the morning star.”] To wit, the first resurrection. He promised
the morning star, which drives away the night, and announces the light, that is, the beginning
of day.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="791"/>
<head>FROM THE THIRD CHAPTER.</head>
<p>The fifth class, company, or association of saints, sets forth men who are careless, and
who are carrying on in the world other transactions than those which they ought—Christians
only in name. And therefore He exhorts them that by any means they should be turned
away from negligence, and be saved; and to this effect He says:—</p>
<p>2. “Be watchful, and strengthen the other things which were ready to die; for I have not
found thy works perfect before God.”] For it is not enough for a tree to live and to have no
fruit, even as it is not enough to be called a Christian and to confess Christ, but not to have
Himself in our work, that is, not to do His precepts.</p>
<p>The sixth class is the mode of life of the best election. The habit of saints is set forth; of
those, to wit, who are lowly in the world, and unskilled in the Scriptures, and who hold the
faith immoveably, and are not at all broken down by any chance, or withdrawn from the
faith by any fear. Therefore He says to them:—</p>
<p>8. “I have set before thee an open door, because thou hast kept the word of my patience.”]
In such little strength.</p>
<p>10. “And I will keep thee from the hour of temptation.”] That they may know His glory
to be of this kind, that they are not indeed permitted to be given over to temptation.</p>
<p>12. “He that overcometh shall be made a pillar in the temple of God.”] For even as a
pillar is an ornament of the building, so he who perseveres shall obtain a nobility in the
Church.</p>
<p>Moreover, the seventh association of the Church declares that they are rich men placed
in positions of dignity, but believing that they are rich, among whom indeed the Scriptures
are discussed in their bedchamber, while the faithful are outside; and they are understood
by none, although they boast themselves, and say that they know all things,—endowed with
the confidence of learning, but ceasing from its labour. And thus He says:—</p>
<p>15. “That they are neither cold nor hot.”] That is, neither unbelieving nor believing, for
they are all things to all men. And because he who is neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm,
gives nausea, He says:—</p>
<p>16. “I will vomit thee out of My mouth.”] Although nausea is hateful, still it hurts no
one; so also is it with men of this kind when they have been cast forth. But because there is
time of repentance, He says:—</p>
<p>18. “I persuade thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire.”] That is, that in whatever
manner you can, you should suffer for the Lord’s name tribulations and passions.</p>
<p>“And anoint thine eyes with eye-salve.”] That what you gladly know by the Scripture,
you should strive also to do the work of the same. And because, if in these ways men return
out of great destruction to great repentance, they are not only useful to themselves, but they
are able also to be of advantage to many, He promised them no small reward,—to sit, namely,
on the throne of judgment.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="792"/>
<head>FROM THE FOURTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>1. “After this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven.”<del status="error"> The</del> new testament is
announced as an open door in heaven.</p>
<p>“And the first voice which I heard was, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me, saying,
Come up hither.”<del status="error"> Since</del> the door is shown to be opened, it is manifest that previously it
had been closed to men. And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended
with His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first voice which he had heard when
he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns those who say that one
spoke in the prophets, another in the Gospel; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that
is the same who spoke in the prophets. For John was of the circumcision, and all that people
which had heard the announcement of the Old Testament was edified with his word.</p>
<p>“That very same voice,” said he, “that I had heard, that said unto me, Come up hither.”<del status="error">
That</del> is the Spirit, whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the Son of
man in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been
foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the former prophets,
and opens up the Scriptures. And because our Lord invited in His own name all believers
into heaven, He forthwith poured out the Holy Spirit, who should bring them to heaven.
He says:—</p>
<p>2. “Immediately I was in the Spirit.”<del status="error"> And</del> since the mind of the faithful is opened by
the Holy Spirit, and that is manifested to them which was also foretold to the fathers, he
distinctly says:—
“And, behold, a throne was set in heaven.”<del status="error"> The</del> throne set: what is it but the throne of
judgment and of the King?</p>
<p>3. “And He that sat upon the throne was, to look upon, like a jasper and a sardine stone.”<del status="error">
Upon</del> the throne he says that he saw the likeness of a jasper and a sardine stone. The jasper
is of the colour of water, the sardine of fire. These two are thence manifested to be placed
as judgments upon God’s tribunal until the consummation of the world, of which judgments
one is already completed in the deluge of water, and the other shall be completed by fire.</p>
<p>“And there was a rainbow about the throne.”<del status="error"> Moreover,</del> the rainbow round about the
throne has the same colours. The rainbow is called a bow from what the Lord spake to Noah
and to his sons,165 that they should not fear any further deluge in the generation of God,
but fire. For thus He says: I will place my bow in the clouds, that ye may now no longer fear
water, but fire.</p>
<p>6. “And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal.”<del status="error"> That</del> is the
gift of baptism which He sheds forth through His Son in time of repentance, before He executes
judgment. It is therefore before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says
<note type="footnote">165 Gen. ix. [Wordsworth, Lect. iv.]</note>

<pb n="793"/>
a sea of glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not agitated by the wind,
not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be immoveable as the house of God.</p>
<p>“And round about the throne were four living creatures.”<del status="error"> The</del> four living creatures are
the four Gospels.</p>
<p>7–10. “The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was like to a calf, and
the third had a face like to a man, and the fourth was like to a flying eagle; and they had six
wings, and round about and within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy,
holy, holy, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, falling down before the throne,
adored God.”<del status="error"> The</del> four and twenty elders are the twenty-four books of the prophets and
of the law, which give testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four
fathers—twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs. And in that the living creatures are different
in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to a lion designates Mark, in whom
is heard the voice of the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of a man, Matthew
strives to declare to us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in
enumerating from Abraham to David, and thence to Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man:
therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. Luke, in narrating the priesthood
of Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that appears to him with
respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf.
John the evangelist, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues
about the Word of God. Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus beginning, “The beginning
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet;”166 The voice of one
crying in the wilderness,”167—has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, “The book of the generation
of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:”168 this is the form of a man.
But Luke said, “There was a priest, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife
was of the daughters of Aaron:”169 this is the likeness of a calf. But John, when he begins,
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,”170
sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their
four similitudes in their respective openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God
the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in
the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion’s whelp.
And when for man’s salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set all men free,
<note type="footnote">166 Mark i. 3. [On the Zoa, see p. 341, supra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">167 Isa. xl. 3.</note>

<note type="footnote">169 Luke i. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">170 John i. 1.</note>

<pb n="794"/>
and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And
that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting
His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they
are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise,
although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the
New Testament those living creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual
providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are
coming after that are within and without.</p>
<p>8. “Six wings.”<del status="error"> These</del> are the testimonies of the books of the Old Testament. Thus,
twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal
cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no
faith unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is
lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards
found to have happened, that begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached
to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what
the prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was vain. For the
Catholic Church holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished.
And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth.
But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there
are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the
Jews who do not receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings;
but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not adjusting facts to their
words. And the books of the Old Testament that are received are twenty-four, which you
will find in the epitomes of Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty
elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles, when they asked,
saying, “We have forsaken all that we had, and followed Thee: what shall we have?” our
Lord replied, “When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”171 But of the fathers also who
should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, “Dan also himself shall judge his people among his
brethren, even as one of the tribes in Israel.”172</p>
<p>5. “And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and seven
torches of fire burning.”<del status="error"> And</del> the lightnings, and voices, and thunders proceeding from the
throne of God, and the seven torches of fire burning, signify announcements, and promises
of adoption, and threatenings. For lightnings signify the Lord’s advent, and the voices the
announcements of the New Testament, and the thunders, that the words are from heaven.

The burning torches of fire signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, that it is given by the wood of
the passion. And when these things were doing, he says that all the elders fell down and
adored the Lord; while the living creatures—that is, of course, the actions recorded in the
Gospels and the teaching of the Lord—gave Him glory and honour.173 In that they had
fulfilled the word that had been previously foretold by them, they worthily and with reason
exult, feeling that they have ministered the mysteries and the word of the Lord. Finally, also,
because He had come who should remove death, and who alone was worthy to take the
crown of immortality, all for the glory of His most excellent doing had crowns.</p>
<p>10. “And they cast their crowns under His feet.”<del status="error"> That is,</del> on account of the eminent
glory of Christ’s victory, they cast all their victories under His feet. This is what in the Gospel
the Holy Spirit consummated by showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had
come to Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the road with
palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments, doubtless these were setting
forth two peoples—the one of the patriarchs, the other of the prophets; that is to say, of the
great men who had any kind of palms of their victories against sin, and cast them under the
feet of Christ, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown signify the same things, and
these are not given save to the victor.</p>

<head>FROM THE FIFTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>1. “And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, a book written within
and without, sealed with seven seals.”<del status="error"> This</del> book signifies the Old Testament, which has
been given into the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who received from the Father judgment.</p>
<p>2, 3. “And I saw an angel full of strength proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy
to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no one was found worthy, neither in
the earth nor under the earth, to open the book.”<del status="error"> Now</del> to open the book is to overcome
death for man.</p>
<p>4. “There was none found worthy to do this.”<del status="error"> Neither</del> among the angels of heaven, nor
among men in earth, nor among the souls of the saints in rest, save Christ the Son of God
alone, whom he says that he saw as a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns.
What had not been then announced, and what the law had contemplated for Him by its
various oblations and sacrifices, it behoved Himself to fulfil. And because He Himself was
the testator, who had overcome death, it was just that Himself should be appointed the
Lord’s heir, that He should possess the substance of the dying man, that is, the human
members.</p>
<p>5. “Lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed.”<del status="error"> We</del> read in
Genesis that this lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered, when the patriarch Jacob says,
“Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee; thou hast lain down and slept, and hast risen up again
as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp.”174 For He is called a lion for the overcoming of death; but
for the suffering for men He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. But because He overcame
death, and anticipated the duty of the executioner, He was called as it were slain. He therefore
opens and seals again the testament, which He Himself had sealed. The legislator Moses
intimating this, that it behoved Him to be sealed and concealed, even to the advent of His
passion, veiled his face, and so spoke to the people; showing that the words of his announcement
were veiled even to the advent of His time. For he himself, when he had read to the
people, having taken the wool purpled with the blood of the calf, with water sprinkled the
whole people, saying, “This is the blood of His testament who hath purified you.”175 It
should therefore be observed that the Man is accurately announced, and that all things
combine into one. For it is not sufficient that that law is spoken of, but it is named as a
testament. For no law is called a testament, nor is any thing else called a testament, save
what persons make who are about to die. And whatever is within the testament is sealed,
even to the day of the testator’s death. Therefore it is with reason that it is only sealed by
the Lamb slain, who, as it were a lion, has broken death in pieces, and has fulfilled what had
<note type="footnote">174 Gen. xlix. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">175 Ex. xxiv. 7, 8.</note>

<pb n="797"/>
been foretold; and has delivered man, that is, the flesh, from death, and has received as a
possession the substance of the dying person, that is, of the human members; that as by one
body all men had fallen under the obligation of its death, also by one body all believers
should be born again unto life, and rise again. Reasonably, therefore, His face is opened and
unveiled to Moses; and therefore He is called Apocalypse, Revelation. For now His book is
unsealed—now the offered victims are perceived—now the fabrication of the priestly chrism;
moreover the testimonies are openly understood.</p>
<p>8, 9. “Twenty-four elders and four living creatures, having harps and phials, and singing
a new song.”<del status="error"> The</del> proclamation of the Old Testament associated with the New, points out
the Christian people singing a new song, that is, bearing their confession publicly. It is a
new thing that the Son of God should become man. It is a new thing to ascend into the
heavens with a body. It is a new thing to give remission of sins to men. It is a new thing for
men to be sealed with the Holy Spirit. It is a new thing to receive the priesthood of sacred
observance, and to look for a kingdom of unbounded promise. The harp, and the chord
stretched on its wooden frame, signifies the flesh of Christ linked with the wood of the
passion. The phial signifies the Confession,176 and the race of the new Priesthood. But it is
the praise of many angels, yea, of all, the salvation of all, and the testimony of the universal
creation, bringing to our Lord thanksgiving for the deliverance of men from the destruction
of death. The unsealing of the seals, as we have said, is the opening of the Old Testament,
and the foretelling of the preachers of things to come in the last times, which, although the
prophetic Scripture speaks by single seals, yet by all the seals opened at once, prophecy takes
its rank.</p>

<head>FROM THE SIXTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>1, 2. “And when the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, I saw, and heard one of
the four living creatures saying, Come and see. And, lo, a white horse, and He who sat upon
him had a bow.” <del status="error"> The</del> first seal being opened, he says that he saw a white horse, and a
crowned horseman having a bow. For this was at first done by Himself. For after the Lord
ascended into heaven and opened all things, He sent the Holy Spirit, whose words the
preachers sent forth as arrows reaching to the human heart, that they might overcome unbelief.
And the crown on the head is promised to the preachers by the Holy Spirit. The
other three horses very plainly signify the wars, famines, and pestilences announced by our
Lord in the Gospel. And thus he says that one of the four living creatures said (because all
four are one), “Come and see.” “Come” is said to him that is invited to faith; “see” is said to
him who saw not. Therefore the white horse is the word of preaching with the Holy Spirit
sent into the world. For the Lord says, “This Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole
world for a testimony to all nations, and then shall come the end.”177</p>
<p>3, 4. “And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying,
Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red, and to him that sat upon
him was given a great sword.”<del status="error"> The</del> red horse, and he that sat upon him, having a sword,
signify the coming wars, as we read in the Gospel: “For nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be great earthquakes in divers places.”178 This is
the ruddy horse.</p>
<p>5. “And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying,
Come and see. And, lo, a black horse; and he who sat upon it had a balance in his hand.”<del status="error">
The</del> black horse signifies famine, for the Lord says, “There shall be famines in divers places;”
but the word is specially extended to the times of Antichrist, when there shall be a great
famine, and when all shall be injured. Moreover, the balance in the hand is the examining
scales, wherein He might show forth the merits of every individual. He then says:—</p>
<p>6. “Hurt not the wine and the oil.”] That is, strike not the spiritual man with thy inflictions.
This is the black horse.</p>
<p>7, 8. “And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying,
Come and see. And, lo, a pale horse; and he who sat upon him was named Death.”<del status="error"> For</del> the
pale horse and he who sat upon him bore the name of Death. These same things also the
Lord had promised among the rest of the coming destructions—great pestilences and deaths;
since, moreover, he says:—</p>
<p>“And hell followed him.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, it was waiting for the devouring of many unrighteous
souls. This is the pale horse.</p>
<note type="footnote">177 Matt. xxiv. 14</note>

<pb n="799"/>
<p>9. “And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that
were slain.”<del status="error"> He</del>p relates that he saw under the altar of God, that is, under the earth, the souls
of them that were slain. For both heaven and earth are called God’s altar, as saith the law,
commanding in the symbolical form of the truth two altars to be made,—a golden one
within, and a brazen one without. But we perceive that the golden altar is thus called heaven,
by the testimony that our Lord bears to it; for He says, “When thou bringest thy gift to the
altar” (assuredly our gifts are the prayers which we offer), “and there rememberest that thy
brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar.”179 Assuredly prayers
ascend to heaven. Therefore heaven is understood to be the golden altar which was within;
for the priests also were accustomed to enter once in the year—as they who had the
anointing—to the golden altar, the Holy Spirit signifying that Christ should do this once
for all. As the golden altar is acknowledged to be heaven, so also by the brazen altar is understood
the earth, under which is the Hades,—a region withdrawn from punishments and
fires, and a place of repose for the saints, wherein indeed the righteous are seen and heard
by the wicked, but they cannot be carried across to them. He who sees all things would have
us to know that these saints, therefore—that is, the souls of the slain—are asking for vengeance
for their blood, that is, of their body, from those that dwell upon the earth; but because
in the last time, moreover, the reward of the saints will be perpetual, and the condemnation
of the wicked shall come, it was told them to wait. And for a solace to their body, there were
given unto each of them white robes. They received, says he, white robes, that is, the gift of
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>12. “And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake.”<del status="error"> In</del>
the sixth seal, then, was a great earthquake: this is that very last persecution.</p>
<p>“And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair.”<del status="error"> The</del> sun becomes as sackcloth; that
is, the brightness of doctrine will be obscured by unbelievers.</p>
<p>“And the entire moon became as blood.”<del status="error"> By</del> the moon of blood is set forth the Church
of the saints as pouring out her blood for Christ.</p>
<p>13. “And the stars fell to the earth.”<del status="error"> The</del> falling of the stars are the faithful who are
troubled for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p>“Even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs.”<del status="error"> The</del> fig-tree, when shaken, loses its untimely
figs—when men are separated from the Church by persecution.</p>
<p>14. “And the heaven withdrew as a scroll that is rolled up.”<del status="error"> For</del> the heaven to be rolled
away, that is, that the Church shall be taken away.</p>
<p>“And every mountain and the islands were moved from their places.”<del status="error"> Mountains</del> and
islands removed from their places intimate that in the last persecution all men departed
from their places; that is, that the good will be removed, seeking to avoid the persecution.</p>

<head>FROM THE SEVENTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>2. “And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.”<del status="error">
He</del> speaks of Elias the prophet, who is the precursor of the times of Antichrist, for the restoration
and establishment of the churches from the great and intolerable persecution. We
read that these things are predicted in the opening of the Old and New Testament; for He
says by Malachi: “Lo, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite, to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children, according to the time of calling, to recall the Jews to the faith of the people
that succeed them.”180 And to that end He shows, as we have said, that the number of those
that shall believe, of the Jews and of the nations, is a great multitude which no man was able
to number. Moreover, we read in the Gospel that the prayers of the Church are sent from
heaven by an angel, and that they are received against wrath, and that the kingdom of Antichrist
is cast out and extinguished by holy angels; for He says: “Pray that ye enter not into
temptation: for there shall be a great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of
the world; and except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved.”181
Therefore He shall send these seven great archangels to smite the kingdom of Antichrist;
for He Himself also thus said: “Then the Son of man shall send His messengers; and they
shall gather together His elect from the four corners of the wind, from the one end of
heaven even to the other end thereof.”182 For, moreover, He previously says by the prophet:
“Then shall there be peace for our land, when there shall arise in it seven shepherds and
eight attacks of men; and they shall encircle Assur,” that is, Antichrist, “in the trench of
Nimrod,”183 that is, in the nation of the devil, by the spirit of the Church. Similarly when
the keepers of the house shall be moved. Moreover, the Lord Himself, in the parable to the
apostles, when the labourers had come to Him and said, “Lord, did not we sow good seed
in Thy field? whence, then, hath it tares? answered them, An enemy hath done this. And
they said to Him, Lord, wilt Thou, then, that we go and root them up? And He said, Nay,
but let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the
reapers, that they gather the tares and make bundles of them, and burn them with fire
everlasting, but that they gather the wheat into my barns.”184 The Apocalypse here shows,
therefore, that these reapers, and shepherds, and labourers, are the angels. And the trumpet
is the word of power. And although the same thing recurs in the phials, still it is not said as
if it occurred twice, but because what is decreed by the Lord to happen shall be once for all;
for this cause it is said twice. What, therefore, He said too little in the trumpets, is here found

in the phials. We must not regard the order of what is said, because frequently the Holy
Spirit, when He has traversed even to the end of the last times, returns again to the same
times, and fills up what He had before failed to say.185 Nor must we look for order in the
Apocalypse; but we must follow the meaning of those things which are prophesied. Therefore
in the trumpets and phials is signified either the desolation of the plagues that are sent upon
the earth, or the madness of Antichrist himself, or the cutting off of the peoples, or the diversity
of the plagues, or the hope in the kingdom of the saints, or the ruin of states, or the
great overthrow of Babylon, that is, the Roman state.</p>
<p>9. “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man was able to number, of
every nation, tribe, and people, and tongue, clothed with white robes.”<del status="error"> What</del> the great
multitude out of every tribe implies, is to show the number of the elect out of all believers,
who, being cleansed by baptism in the blood of the Lamb, have made their robes white,
keeping the grace which they have received.</p>

<p>1, 2. “I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and
a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of
fire: and he had in his hand an open book: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his
left foot upon the earth.”<del status="error"> He</del> signifies that that mighty angel who, he says, descended from
heaven, clothed with a cloud, is our Lord, as we have above narrated.</p>
<p>“His face was as it were the sun.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, with respect to the resurrection.</p>
<p>“Upon his head was a rainbow.”<del status="error"> He</del> points to the judgment which is executed by Him,
or shall be.</p>
<p>“An open book.”<del status="error"> A</del> revelation of works in the future judgment, or the Apocalypse
which John received.</p>
<p>“His feet,”<del status="error"> as</del> we have said above, are the apostles. For that both things in sea and land
are trodden under foot by Him, signifies that all things are placed under His feet. Moreover,
he calls Him an angel, that is, a messenger, to wit, of the Father; for He is called the Messenger
of great counsel. He says also that He cried with a loud voice. The great voice is to tell the
words of the Omnipotent God of heaven to men, and to bear witness that after penitence
is closed there will be no hope subsequently.</p>
<p>3. “Seven thunders uttered their voices.”<del status="error"> The</del> seven thunders uttering their voices signify
the Holy Spirit of sevenfold power, who through the prophets announced all things to
come, and by His voice John gave his testimony in the world; but because he says that he
was about to write the things which the thunders had uttered, that is, whatever things had
been obscure in the announcements of the Old Testament; he is forbidden to write them,
but he was charged to leave them sealed, because he is an apostle, nor was it fitting that the
grace of the subsequent stage should be given in the first. “The time,” says he, “is at hand.”187
For the apostles, by powers, by signs, by portents, and by mighty works, have overcome
unbelief. After them there is now given to the same completed Churches the comfort of
having the prophetic Scriptures subsequently interpreted, for I said that after the apostles
there would be interpreting prophets.</p>
<p>For the apostle says: “And he placed in the Church indeed, first, apostles; secondly,
prophets; thirdly, teachers,”188 and the rest. And in another place he says: “Let the prophets
speak two or three, and let the others judge.”189 And he says: “Every woman that prayeth
or prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head.”190 And when he says,
<note type="footnote">187 Rev. i. 3, xxii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">188 1 Cor. xii. 28.</note>

<pb n="805"/>
“Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge,” he is not speaking in respect
of the Catholic prophecy of things unheard and unknown, but of things both announced
and known. But let them judge whether or not the interpretation is consistent with the
testimonies of the prophetic utterance.191 It is plain, therefore, that to John, armed as he
was with superior virtue, this was not necessary, although the body of Christ, which is the
Church, adorned with His members, ought to respond to its position.</p>
<p>10. “I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up.”<del status="error"> To</del> take the book and
eat it up, is, when exhibition of a thing is made to one, to commit it to memory.</p>
<p>“And it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.”<del status="error"> To</del> be sweet in the mouth is the reward
of the preaching of the speaker, and is most pleasant to the hearers; but it is most bitter both
to those that announce it, and to those that persevere in its commandments through suffering.</p>
<p>11. “And He says unto me, Thou must again prophesy to the peoples, and to the tongues,
and to the nations, and to many kings.”<del status="error"> He</del> says this, because when John said these things
he was in the island of Patmos, condemned to the labour of the mines by Cæsar Domitian.
There, therefore, he saw the Apocalypse; and when grown old, he thought that he should
at length receive his quittance by suffering, Domitian being killed, all his judgments were
discharged. And John being dismissed from the mines, thus subsequently delivered the same
Apocalypse which he had received from God. This, therefore, is what He says: Thou must
again prophesy to all nations, because thou seest the crowds of Antichrist rise up; and against
them other crowds shall stand, and they shall fall by the sword on the one side and on the
other.</p>

<head>FROM THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>1. “And there was shown unto me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying,
Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.”<del status="error"> A</del> reed
was shown like to a rod. This itself is the Apocalypse which he subsequently exhibited to
the churches; for the Gospel of the complete faith he subsequently wrote for the sake of our
salvation. For when Valentinus, and Cerinthus, and Ebion, and others of the school of Satan,
were scattered abroad throughout the world, there assembled together to him from the
neighbouring provinces all the bishops, and compelled him himself also to draw up his
testimony. Moreover, we say that the measure of God’s temple is the command of God to
confess the Father Almighty, and that His Son Christ was begotten by the Father before the
beginning of the world, and was made man in very soul and flesh, both of them having
overcome misery and death; and that, when received with His body into heaven by the
Father, He shed forth the Holy Spirit, the gift and pledge of immortality, that He was announced
by the prophets, He was described by the law, He was God’s hand, and the Word
of the Father from God, Lord over all, and founder of the world: this is the reed and the
measure of faith; and no one worships the holy altar save he who confesses this faith.</p>
<p>2. “The court which is within the temple leave out.”<del status="error"> The</del> space which is called the court
is the empty altar within the walls: these being such as were not necessary, he commanded
to be ejected from the Church.</p>
<p>“It is given to be trodden down by the Gentiles.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, to the men of this world, that
it may be trodden under foot by the nations, or with the nations. Then he repeats about the
destruction and slaughter of the last time, and says:—</p>
<p>3. “They shall tread the holy city down for forty and two months; and I will give to my
two witnesses, and they shall predict a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed
in sackcloth.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, three years and six months: these make forty-two months. Therefore
their preaching is three years and six months, and the kingdom of Antichrist as much again.</p>
<p>5. “If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their
enemies.”<del status="error"> That</del> fire proceedeth out of the mouth of those prophets against the adversaries,
bespeaks the power of the world. For all afflictions, however many there are, shall be sent
by their messengers in their word. Many think that there is Elisha, or Moses, with Elijah;
but both of these died; while the death of Elijah is not heard of, with whom all our ancients
have believed that it was Jeremiah. For even the very word spoken to him testifies to him,
saying, “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of
the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.”192 But he was
<note type="footnote">192 Jer i. 5.</note>

<pb n="807"/>
not a prophet unto the nations; and thus the truthful word of God makes it necessary, which
it has promised to set forth, that he should be a prophet to the nations.</p>
<p>4. “These are the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.”<del status="error"> These</del> two
candlesticks and two olive trees He has to this end spoken of, and admonished you that if,
when you have read of them elsewhere, you have not understood, you may understand here.
For in Zechariah, one of the twelve prophets, it is thus written: “These are the two olive trees
and two candlesticks which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth;”193 that is, they
are in paradise. Also, in another sense, standing in the presence of the lord of the earth, that

<p>7. “And the beast which ascendeth from the abyss.”<del status="error"> After</del> many plagues completed in
the world, in the end he says that a beast ascended from the abyss. But that he shall ascend
from the abyss is proved by many testimonies; for he says in the thirty-first chapter of Ezekiel:
“Behold, Assur was a cypress in Mount Lebanon.” Assur, deeply rooted, was a lofty and
branching cypress—that is, a numerous people—in Mount Lebanon, in the kingdom of
kingdoms, that is, of the Romans. Moreover, that he says he was beautiful in offshoots, he
says he was strong in armies. The water, he says, shall nourish him, that is, the many thousands
of men which were subjected to him; and the abyss increased him, that is, belched
him forth. For even Isaiah speaks almost in the same words; moreover, that he was in the
kingdom of the Romans, and that he was among the Cæsars. The Apostle Paul also bears
witness, for he says to the Thessalonians: “Let him who now restraineth restrain, until he
be taken out of the way; and then shall appear that Wicked One, even he whose coming is
after the working of Satan, with signs and lying wonders.”194 And that they might know
that he should come who then was the prince, he added: “He already endeavours after the
secret of mischief”195—that is, the mischief which he is about to do he strives to do secretly;
but he is not raised up by his own power, nor by that of his father, but by command of God,
of which thing Paul says in the same passage: “For this cause, because they have not received
the love of God, He will send upon them a spirit of error, that they all may be persuaded of
a lie, who have not been persuaded of the truth.”196 And Isaiah saith: “While they waited
for the light, darkness arose upon them.”197 Therefore the Apocalypse sets forth that these
prophets are killed by the same, and on the fourth day rise again, that none might be found
equal to God.</p>

called Sodom and Egypt.”<del status="error"> But</del> He calls Jerusalem Sodom and Egypt, since it had become
the heaping up of the persecuting people. Therefore it behooves us diligently, and with the
utmost care, to follow the prophetic announcement, and to understand what the Spirit from
the Father both announces and anticipates, and how, when He has gone forward to the last
times, He again repeats the former ones. And now, what He will do once for all, He sometimes
sets forth as if it were done; and unless you understand this, as sometimes done, and sometimes
as about to be done, you will fall into a great confusion. Therefore the interpretation
of the following sayings has shown therein, that not the order of the reading, but the order
of the discourse, must be understood.</p>
<p>19. “And the temple of God was opened which is in heaven.”<del status="error"> The</del> temple opened is a
manifestation of our Lord. For the temple of God is the Son, as He Himself says: “Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” And when the Jews said, “Forty and six years
was this temple in building,” the evangelist says, “He spake of the temple of His body.”198</p>

<head>FROM THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.</head>
<p>1. “And there was seen a great sign in heaven. A woman clothed with the sun, and the
moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. And being with child, she
cried out travailing, and bearing torments that she might bring forth.”<del status="error"> The</del> woman clothed
with the sun, and having the moon under her feet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars upon
her head, and travailing in her pains, is the ancient Church of fathers, and prophets, and
saints, and apostles,199 which had the groans and torments of its longing until it saw that
Christ, the fruit of its people according to the flesh long promised to it, had taken flesh out
of the selfsame people. Moreover, being clothed with the sun intimates the hope of resurrection
and the glory of the promise. And the moon intimates the fall of the bodies of the saints
under the obligation of death, which never can fail. For even as life is diminished, so also it
is increased. Nor is the hope of those that sleep extinguished absolutely, as some think, but
they have in their darkness a light such as the moon. And the crown of twelve stars signifies
the choir of fathers, according to the fleshly birth, of whom Christ was to take flesh.</p>
<p>3. “And there appeared another sign in heaven; and behold a red dragon, having seven
heads.”<del status="error"> Now,</del> that he says that this dragon was of a red colour—that is, of a purple colour—
the result of his work gave him such a colour. For from the beginning (as the Lord
says) he was a murderer; and he has oppressed the whole of the human race, not so much
by the obligation of death, as, moreover, by the various forms of destruction and fatal mischiefs.
His seven heads were the seven kings of the Romans, of whom also is Antichrist, as
we have said above.</p>
<p>“And ten horns.”<del status="error"> He</del> says that the ten kings in the latest times are the same as these, as
we shall more fully set forth there.</p>
<p>4. “And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them upon the earth.”<del status="error">
Now,</del> that he says that the dragon’s tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, this may
be taken in two ways. For many think that he may be able to seduce the third part of the
men who believe.200 But it should more truly be understood, that of the angels that were
subject to him, since he was still a prince when he descended from his estate, he seduced
the third part; therefore what we said above, the Apocalypse says.</p>
<p>“And the dragon stood before the woman who was beginning to bring forth, that, when
she had brought forth, he might devour her child.”<del status="error"> The</del> red dragon standing and desiring
to devour her child when she had brought him forth, is the devil,—to wit, the traitor angel,
who thought that the perishing of all men would be alike by death; but He, who was not
born of seed, owed nothing to death: wherefore he could not devour Him—that is, detain

Him in death—for on the third day He rose again. Finally, also, and before He suffered, he
approached to tempt Him as man; but when he found that He was not what he thought
Him to be, he departed from Him, even till the time. Whence it is here said:—</p>
<p>5. “And she brought forth a son, who begins to rule all nations with a rod of iron.”<del status="error"> The</del>
rod of iron is the sword of persecution.</p>
<p>“I saw that all men withdrew from his abodes.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, the good will be removed, flying
from persecution.201</p>
<p>“And her son was caught up to God, and to His throne.”<del status="error"> We</del> read also in the Acts of
the Apostles that He was caught up to God’s throne, just as speaking with the disciples He
was caught up to heaven.</p>
<p>6. “But the woman fled into the wilderness, and there were given to her two great eagle’s
wings.”<del status="error"> The</del> aid of the great eagle’s wings—to wit, the gift of prophets—was given to that
Catholic Church, whence in the last times a hundred and forty-four thousands of men
should believe on the preaching of Elias; but, moreover, he here says that the rest of the
people should be found alive on the coming of the Lord. And the Lord says in the Gospel:
“Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains;”202 that is, as many as should be
gathered together in Judea, let them go to that place which they have ready, and let them
be supported there for three years and six months from the presence of the devil.</p>
<p>14. “Two great wings”<del status="error"> are</del> the two prophets—Elias, and the prophet who shall be with
him.</p>
<p>15. “And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a flood, that he
might carry her away with the flood.”<del status="error"> He</del> signifies by the water which the serpent cast out
of his mouth, the people who at his command would persecute her.</p>
<p>16. “And the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the
flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.”<del status="error"> That</del> the earth opened her month and
swallowed up the waters, sets forth the vengeance for the present troubles. Although,
therefore, it may signify this woman bringing forth, it shows her afterwards flying when her
offspring is brought forth, because both things did not happen at one time; for we know
that Christ was born, but that the time should arrive that she should flee from the face of
the serpent: (we do not know) that this has happened as yet. Then he says:—</p>
<p>7–9. “There was a battle in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and
the dragon warred, and his angels, and they prevailed not; nor was their place found any
more in heaven. And that great dragon was cast forth, that old serpent: he was cast forth
into the earth.”<del status="error"> This</del> is the beginning of Antichrist; yet previously Elias must prophesy, and
there must be times of peace. And afterwards, when the three years and six months are

completed in the preaching of Elias, he also must be cast down from heaven, where up till
that time he had had the power of ascending; and all the apostate angels, as well as Antichrist,
must be roused up from hell. Paul the apostle says: “Except there come a falling away first,
and the man of sin shall appear, the son of perdition; and the adversary who exalted himself
above all which is called God, or which is worshipped.”203</p>

kingdom of that time of Antichrist, and the people mingled with the variety of nations.</p>
<p>2. “His feet were as the feet of a bear.”<del status="error"> A</del> strong and most unclean beast, the feet are to
be understood as his leaders.</p>
<p>“And his mouth as the mouth of a lion.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, his mouth armed for blood is his

six.”<del status="error"> As</del> they have it reckoned from the Greek characters, they thus find it among many to
be τειταν, for τειταν has this number, which the Gentiles call Sol and Phoebus; and it is
reckoned in Greek thus: τ three hundred, ε five, ι ten, τ three hundred, α one, ν fifty,—which
taken together become six hundred and sixty-six. For as far as belongs to the Greek letters,
they fill up this number and name; which name if you wish to turn into Latin, it is understood
by the antiphrase DICLUX, which letters are reckoned in this manner: since D figures five
hundred, I one, C a hundred, L fifty, V five, X ten,—which by the reckoning up of the letters
makes similarly six hundred and sixty-six, that is, what in Greek gives τειταν, to wit, what
in Latin is called DICLUX; by which name, expressed by antiphrases, we understand Antichrist,
who, although he be cut off from the supernal light, and deprived thereof, yet transforms
himself into an angel of light, daring to call himself light.205 Moreover, we find in a
certain Greek codex αντεμος, which letters being reckoned up, you will find to give the
number as above: α one, ν fifty, τ three hundred, ε five, μ forty, ο seventy, ς two hundred,—
which together makes six hundred and sixty-six, according to the Greeks. Moreover,
there is another name in Gothic of him, which will be evident of itself, that is, γενσήρικος,
which in the same way you will reckon in Greek letters: γ three, ε five, ν fifty, σ two hundred,
η eight, ρ a hundred, ι ten, κ twenty, ο seventy, ς also two hundred, which, as has been said
above, make six hundred and sixty-six.</p>

<p>“And he had two horns like a lamb—that is, the appearance within of a man—and he
spoke like a dragon.”<del status="error"> But</del> the devil speaks full of malice; for he shall do these things in the
presence of men, so that even the dead appear to rise again.</p>
<p>13. “And he shall make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men.”<del status="error"> Yes</del> (as I also
have said), in the sight of men. Magicians do these things, by the aid of the apostate angels,
even to this day. He shall cause also that a golden image of Antichrist shall be placed in the
temple at Jerusalem, and that the apostate angel should enter, and thence utter voices and
oracles. Moreover, he himself shall contrive that his servants and children should receive
as a mark on their foreheads, or on their right hands, the number of his name, lest any one
should buy or sell them. Daniel had previously predicted his contempt and provocation of
God. “And he shall place,” says he, “his temple within Samaria, upon the illustrious and
holy mountain that is at Jerusalem, an image such as Nebuchadnezzar had made.”206 Thence
here he places, and by and by here he renews, that of which the Lord, admonishing His
churches concerning the last times and their dangers, says: “But when ye shall see the contempt
which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place, let him who
readeth understand.”207 It is called a contempt when God is provoked, because idols are
worshipped instead of God, or when the dogma of heretics is introduced in the churches.
But it is a turning away because stedfast men, seduced by false signs and portents, are turned
away from their salvation.</p>

the midst of heaven, whom he says that he saw, we have already treated of above, as being
the same Elias who anticipates the kingdom of Antichrist in his prophecy.</p>
<p>8. “And another angel following him.”<del status="error"> The</del> other angel following, he speaks of as the
same prophet who is the associate of his prophesying. But that he says,—</p>
<p>15. “Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather in the grapes of the vine,”<del status="error"> he</del> signifies it of
the nations that should perish on the advent of the Lord. And indeed in many forms he
shows this same thing, as if to the dry harvest, and the seed for the coming of the Lord, and
the consummation of the world, and the kingdom of Christ, and the future appearance of
the kingdom of the blessed.</p>
<p>19, 20. “And the angel thrust in the sickle, and reaped the vine of the earth, and cast it
into the wine-press of the wrath of God. And the wine-press of His fury was trodden down
without the city.”<del status="error"> In</del> that he says that it was cast into the wine-press of the wrath of God,
and trodden down without the city, the treading of the wine-press is the retribution on the
sinner.</p>
<p>“And blood went out from the wine-press, even unto the horse-bridles.”<del status="error"> The</del> vengeance
of shed blood as was before predicted, “In blood thou hast sinned, and blood shall follow
thee.”208</p>
<p>“For a thousand and six hundred furlongs.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, through all the four parts of the

and these shall be in the last time, when the Church shall have gone out of the midst.</p>

me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of that great whore who sitteth upon many
waters. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the
martyrs.”<del status="error"> The</del> decrees of that senate are always accomplished against all, contrary to the
preaching of the true faith; and now already mercy being cast aside, itself here gave the decree
among all nations.</p>
<p>3. “And I saw the woman herself sitting upon the scarlet-coloured beast, full of names
of blasphemy.”<del status="error"> But</del> to sit upon the scarlet beast, the author of murders, is the image of the
devil. Where also is treated of his captivity, concerning which we have fully considered. I
remember, indeed, that this is called Babylon also in the Apocalypse, on account of confusion;
and in Isaiah also; and Ezekiel called it Sodom. In fine, if you compare what is said against
Sodom, and what Isaiah says against Babylon, and what the Apocalypse says, you will find
that they are all one.209</p>
<p>9. “The seven heads are the seven hills, on which the woman sitteth.”<del status="error"> That</del> is, the city
of Rome.</p>
<p>10. “And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come;
and when he is come, he will be for a short time.”<del status="error"> The</del> time must be understood in which
the written Apocalypse was published, since then reigned Cæsar Domitian; but before him
had been Titus his brother, and Vespasian, Otho, Vitellius, and Galba. These are the five
who have fallen. One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was written—Domitian, to wit.
“The other has not yet come,” speaks of Nerva; “and when he is come, he will be for a short
time,” for he did not complete the period of two years.</p>
<p>11. “And the beast which thou sawest is of the seven.”<del status="error"> Since</del> before those kings Nero
reigned.</p>
<p>“And he is the eighth.”<del status="error"> He</del> says only when this beast shall come, reckon it the eighth
place, since in that is the completion. He added:—</p>
<p>“And shall go into perdition.”<del status="error"> For</del> that ten kings received royal power when he shall
move from the east, he says. He shall be sent from the city of Rome with his armies. And
Daniel sets forth the ten horns and the ten diadems. And that these are eradicated from the
former ones,—that is, that three of the principal leaders are killed by Antichrist: that the
other seven give him honour and wisdom and power, of whom he says:—</p>
<p>16. “These shall hate the whore, to wit, the city, and shall burn her flesh with fire.”<del status="error"> Now</del>
that one of the heads was, as it were, slain to death, and that the stroke of his death was
directed, he speaks of Nero. For it is plain that when the cavalry sent by the senate was
pursuing him, he himself cut his throat. Him therefore, when raised up, God will send as a
<note type="footnote">209 [Apparently in conflict with what our author says supra, pp. 352 and 355.]</note>

<pb n="817"/>
worthy king, but worthy in such a way as the Jews merited. And since he is to have another
name, He shall also appoint another name, that so the Jews may receive him as if he were
the Christ. Says Daniel: “He shall not know the lust of women, although before he was most
impure, and he shall know no God of his fathers: for he will not be able to seduce the people
of the circumcision, unless he is a judge of the law.”210 Finally, also, he will recall the saints,
not to the worship of idols, but to undertake circumcision, and, if he is able, to seduce any;
for he shall so conduct himself as to be called Christ by them. But that he rises again from
hell, we have said above in the word of Isaiah: “Water shall nourish him, and hell hath increased
him;” who, however, must come with name unchanged, and doings unchanged, as
says the Spirit.</p>

chain in his hand. And he held the dragon, that old serpent, which is called the Devil and
Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up,
and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years
should be finished: after this he must be loosed a little season.”<del status="error"> Those</del> years wherein Satan
is bound are in the first advent of Christ, even to the end of the age; and they are called a
thousand, according to that mode of speaking, wherein a part is signified by the whole, just
as is that passage, “the word which He commanded for a thousand generations,”211 although
they are not a thousand. Moreover that he says, “and he cast him into the abyss,” he says
this, because the devil, excluded from the hearts of believers, began to take possession of
the wicked, in whose hearts, blinded day by day, he is shut up as if in a profound abyss. And
he shut him up, says he, and put a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations
until the thousand years should be finished. “He shut the door upon him,” it is said, that is,
he forbade and restrained his seducing those who belong to Christ. Moreover, he put a seal
upon him, because it is hidden who belong to the side of the devil, and who to that of Christ.
For we know not of those who seem to stand whether they shall not fall, and of those who
are down it is uncertain whether they may rise. Moreover, that he says that he is bound and
shut up, that he may not seduce the nations, the nations signify the Church, seeing that of
them it itself is formed, and which being seduced, he previously held until, he says, the
thousand years should be completed, that is, what is left of the sixth day, to wit, of the sixth
age, which subsists for a thousand years; after this he must be loosed for a little season. The
little season signifies three years and six months, in which with all his power the devil will
avenge himself under Antichrist against the Church. Finally, he says, after that the devil
shall be loosed, and will seduce the nations in the whole world, and will entice war against
the Church, the number of whose foes shall be as the sand of the sea.212</p>
<p>4, 5. “And I saw thrones, and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given unto
them; and I saw the souls of them that were slain on account of the testimony of Jesus, and
for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received
his writing on their forehead or in their hand; and they reigned with Christ for a
thousand years: the rest of them lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This
is the first resurrection.”<del status="error"> There</del> are two resurrections. But the first resurrection is now of
the souls that are by the faith, which does not permit men to pass over to the second death.
Of this resurrection the apostle says: “If ye have risen with Christ, seek those things which
are above.”213</p>

<p>6. “Blessed and holy is he who has part in this resurrection: on them the second death
shall have no power, but they shall be priests of God and Christ, and they shall reign with
Him a thousand years.”<del status="error"> I</del> do not think the reign of a thousand years is eternal; or if it is
thus to be thought of, they cease to reign when the thousand years are finished. But I will
put forward what my capacity enables me to judge. The tenfold number signifies the decalogue,
and the hundredfold sets forth the crown of virginity: for he who shall have kept the
undertaking of virginity completely, and shall have faithfully fulfilled the precepts of the
decalogue, and shall have destroyed the untrained nature or impure thoughts within the
retirement of the heart, that they may not rule over him, this is the true priest of Christ, and
accomplishing the millenary number thoroughly, is thought to reign with Christ; and truly
in his case the devil is bound. But he who is entangled in the vices and the dogmas of heretics,
in his case the devil is loosed. But that it says that when the thousand years are finished he
is loosed, so the number of the perfect saints being completed, in whom there is the glory
of virginity in body and mind, by the approaching advent of the kingdom of the hateful one,
many, seduced by that love of earthly things, shall be overthrown, and together with him
shall enter the lake of fire.</p>
<p>8–10. “And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of
the saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and
devoured them. And the devil who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where both the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever and
ever.”<del status="error"> This</del> belongs to the last judgment. And after a little time the earth was made holy,
as being at least that wherein lately had reposed the bodies of the virgins, when they shall
enter upon an eternal kingdom with an immortal King, as they who are not only virgins in
body, but, moreover, with equal inviolability have protected themselves, both in tongue and
thought, from wickedness; and these, it shows, shall dwell in rejoicing for ever with the

<head>FROM THE TWENTY-FIRST AND TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTERS.</head>
<p>16. “And the city is placed in a square.”<del status="error"> The</del> city which he says is squared, he says also
is resplendent with gold and precious stones, and has a sacred street, and a river through
the midst of it, and the tree of life on either side, bearing twelve manner of fruits throughout
the twelve months; and that the light of the sun is not there, because the Lamb is the light
of it; and that its gates were of single pearls; and that there were three gates on each of the
four sides, and that they could not be shut. I say, in respect of the square city, he shows forth
the united multitude of the saints, in whom the faith could by no means waver. As Noah is
commanded to make the ark of squared beams,214 that it might resist the force of the deluge,
by the precious stones he sets forth the holy men who cannot waver in persecution, who
could not be moved either by the tempest of persecutors, or be dissolved from the true faith
by the force of the rain, because they are associated of pure gold, of whom the city of the
great King is adorned. Moreover, the streets set forth their hearts purified from all uncleanness,
transparent with glowing light, that the Lord may justly walk up and down in them.
The river of life sets forth that the grace of spiritual doctrine flowed through the minds of
the faithful, and that manifold flourishing forms of odours germinated therein. The tree of
life on either bank sets forth the Advent of Christ, according to the flesh, who satisfied the
peoples wasted with famine, that received life from One by the wood of the Cross, with the
announcement of God’s word. And in that he says that the sun is not necessary in the city,
he shows, evidently, that the Creator as the immaculate light shines in the midst of it, whose
brightness no mind has been able to conceive, nor tongue to tell.</p>
<p>In that he says there are three gates placed on each of the four sides, of single pearls, I
think that these are the four virtues,215 to wit, prudence, fortitude, justice, temperance,
which are associated with one another. And, being involved together, they make the number
twelve. But the twelve gates we believe to be the number of the apostles, who, shining in the
four virtues as precious stones, manifesting the light of their doctrine among the saints,
cause it to enter the celestial city, that by intercourse with them the choir of angels may be
gladdened. And that the gates cannot be shut, it is evidently shown that the doctrine of the
apostles can be separated from rectitude by no tempest of contradiction. Even though the
floods of the nations and the vain superstitions of heretics should revolt against their true
faith, they are overcome, and shall be dissolved as the foam, because Christ is the Rock216
by which, and on which, the Church is founded.217 And thus it is overcome by no traces of
maddened men. Therefore they are not to be heard who assure themselves that there is to

<head>GENERAL NOTES BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR</head>
<p>1. The whole subject of the Apocalypse is so treated,219 in the Speaker's Commentary,
as to elucidate many questions suggested by the primitive commentators of this series, and
to furnish the latest judgments of critics on the subject. It is so immense a matter, however,
as to render annotations on patristic specialties impossible in a work like this. Every reader
must feel how apposite is the sententious saying of Augustine: “Apocalypsis Joannis tot
sacramenta quot verba.”</p>
<p>2. The seven spirits, p. 344, ver. 4. That is, the one Spirit in His seven-fold gifts. He now
fulfills the promise of Christ, “He shall show you things to come.” Without this complement
the Church would lack assurance that her great Head upon the throne has ordered and
limited the whole course of this world for her conflicts and her final triumph by the Spirit's
power. St. John’s rapture was the Spirit’s work: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day.”220
The whole Apocalypse is an Easter sermon (on the text, i. 18) and an Easter song (vers. 9-
14, and passim). It supplements the appearances of the risen Redeemer for identification,
by a manifestation, which is the Church’s assurance of His glorification, and of His perpetual
work in her and for her, as well as of His presence with her, by the Spirit.</p>
<p>3. Seven golden candlesticks, p. 344, ver. 12. The symbol of the seven-fold Spirit in the
Church. On the Arch of Titus this symbol had just been set up as proof of its removal from
the Mosaic Church. It is now found to be transferred to the “seven churches,” a symbol of
the Catholic Church221 or the “communion of saints.” The threatening of removal from
particular churches derives force from the (then) recent removal out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>4. All the Saints shall assemble, p. 345, ver. 15. Our author clings to the purer Chiliasm
of Commodian, to which Augustine had now given the death-blow by his famous retraction.</p>
<p>5. New forms of prophesying, p. 347, ver.17. A retrospective glance at Montanism, and
a caveat against the mistakes of Tertullian.</p>
<p>6. I will vomit thee, p. 347, ver. 17. Bishop Wordsworth suggests, that, if the canon of
Scripture compiled by the church of Laodicea lacks the Apocalypse, its terrible reproof of
that church may have influenced its unwillingness to accept it. Accordingly she was vomited,
and perished in the Saracen invasion.</p>

<p>7. That is the Spirit, p. 348, ver. 1. Christ’s divine nature as distinguished from his flesh.223
“In a word,” says Professor Milligan,224 “πνευμα is a short expression for our Lord’s resurrection
state.” A truth, but based on the distinction between the flesh of Christ and His
spiritual nature as the Word. See Tertullian,225 vol. iii. p. 609, note 5, and p. 610, note 5:
also 2 Cor. iii. 17-18.</p>
<p>8. The genealogy of Mary, p. 348, vers. 7-10. It is remarkable that St. Matthew should be
credited with this, and not St. Luke, who in the sixteenth century226 began to be regarded
as giving the ancestry of Mary. See Africanus227 on the subject, and my elucidation,228 in
which I followed Wordsworth. Though I had already prepared the pages of Victorinus for
the press, I failed to note at that time this modification of the general truth, that antiquity
regards both genealogies as those of Joseph.</p>
<p>9. Dan himself, p. 349, ver. 8. Here is a touch of Chiliasm again, i.e., of the better sort.
Even Dan is promised a restoration: and the use of Gen. xlix. 16 for that intent is noteworthy,
as compared with Rev. vii. 5-8, where Dan is omitted. But Hippolytus takes a very different
view of the same text.229</p>
<p>10. Hades, p. 351. “A region withdrawn from punishment and fires,” says our author.
He identifies it with paradise, and shows that in his day the Latin churches knew of no
purgatorial fires. He knows of nothing but a place for those “who die in the Lord,” and a
place for the wicked. It is perpetually overlooked, that, in the fiction of “purgatory,” it is
only the righteous who are entitled to it: none but those dying in full communion with the
Church having any portion in it, or any title to Masses for their repose. Of all this our author
had no conception.230</p>
<p>11. To take the book and eat it up, p. 353, ver. 10. We must not fail to note with this the
passage Jer. xv. 16, where the Revised Version pedantically sacrifices the Septuagint reading,
ὁ λόγος σου, (which is followed by the Vulgate), distinguishing “sermones tui” from “Verbum
tuum.” The Seventy have testified to this distinction in their day, and their copies of the
Hebrew must have supported it. So understood, what riches in the text of Jeremiah!</p>

<p>12. Thessalonians, p. 354, ver. 7. On which much that is suggestive is said by St.
Augustine, though he confesses, concerning what St. Paul had said to the Thessalonians,
“Ego prorsus quid dixerit me fateor ignorare.” See De Civ. Dei, lib. xx. cap. 19, p. 685, ed.
Migne.</p>
<p>13. The woman, p. 355, ver. 1. Compare vol. vi. p. 337, note 4, and Elucidation II. p. 355.
It is quite important to observe the voice of antiquity on a matter which, in our own times,
has been made a stumbling-block to souls by a wanton, personal act of the Bishop of Rome
and his dogma of the “Immaculate Conception.”</p>
<p>14. The hope of those that sleep, p. 355, ver. 1. To make our author consistent with
himself (see note 10, supra), we should read thus: “But they have in their darkness a light
(some think) such as the moon.” Here, however, it seems to me, he is giving his mind to
“the Church of Fathers and Prophets” exclusively, in which its “saints and apostles” were
for a time waiting and looking for the Man-child. Even that Church of the Hebrews had, in
Hades, light “like that of the moon,” where they reposed in Abraham’s bosom; but Christ
removed them into a fairer region, i.e., Paradise, when He illuminated Hades, and then became
“the first-fruits of them that slept.” Such seems to be the sense.</p>
<p>15. In a certain Greek codex, p. 357, ver. 18. Can αντεμος here be a reference to
Anthemius, of the kindred of Julian (d. a.d. 472)? His history, mixed up with that of Ricimer,
connects with Genseric, who died a.d. 477.</p>
<p>16. Sea of the north, p. 358, ver. 11. The Mediterranean, near Mount Carmel, is “the sea
of Phoenice,” I suppose: but how the Arabian Gulf can be called the sea of the north, I do
not comprehend. As Routh says, the manuscripts must have been much corrupted.</p>
<p>17. Two resurrections, p. 359, ver. 5. Here our author, who is supposed to be the contemporary
of St. Augustine, accepts his final judgment.231 But Victorinus was a Chiliast of the
better sort, according to St. Jerome. This confirms the corruption of the mss. Indeed, if the
Victorinus mentioned by Jerome be the same as our author, the mention of Genseric proves
the subsequent interpolation of his works.</p>
<p>18. It is evident that the fragment which is here preserved, if, indeed, it be the work of
Caius Marius Victorinus, surnamed Afer, is full of the corrections of some pious disciple
of St. Augustine who lived much later. The reader must consult Lardner,232 and compare
Routh, whose notes on this treatise are indeed few. He does not think the reference to abbots233
of any consequence in determining its age, because he finds albatorum elsewhere
sustained as the true reading, i.e., those “made white in the blood of the Lamb.” But the great
probability that there were two authors of the name living in different ages seems more than

Fabius by the English translator), leaves one yet more in a mist as to the identity of our author
with the one he writes about.</p>

<pb n="828"/>
<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE
TO
DIONYSIUS, BISHOP OF ROME.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 259-269.</del> Dionysius is no exception to the rule that Latin Christianity had no place
in Rome till after the Nicene Council. He was a Greek by birth, and reflects the spirit and
orthodoxy of the Greek Fathers; and what we have from him is written in the Greek language.
We find it in Athanasius, where, remarks Waterland,1 its genuineness cannot be suspected,
because “Athanasius did not entirely approve of it, and would certainly never have forged
an interpretation different from his own.” He concurred with the Easterns in the discipline
of Paul of Samosata. Waterland says of the following fragment: “It is of admirable use for
showing the doctrine of the Trinity as professed by the Church of Christ at that time.”</p>
<p>The purely receptive character of the Roman See during the Ante-Nicene period must
be sufficiently apparent to the possessors of the volumes of this series. Until after the
Council of Nice, as a Roman pontiff has testified, she was unfelt in the churches as a teaching
church.2 Irenæus has justly stated her case: as the focus of the empire, she was the natural
center of exchange and social commerce among all nations. Thither all Christians converged,
and there at all times might be found representatives of all the churches,—those of Gaul
and Britain; those of Asia Minor and Syria; those of Alexandria and Egypt; those of North
Africa, where Latin Christianity had begun to exist, and where it had reached a vigorous
maturity at the Nicene period. Hence, from all these churches came into Rome a Catholic
testimony, which was thus preserved at the metropolis by the pressure from without.</p>
<p>This is the fact which gives importance to the earliest dogmatic testimony proceeding
from the See of Rome.3 Dionysius has the great distinction of sustaining the orthodoxy
which Hippolytus and other comprovincial bishops had established against the heresy of
two of his predecessors; and this little essay, embedded in the works of Athanasius, comes
forth as a genuine “bee” out of his precious amber, sweet with the honey of truth, and pungent
with the sting of an acute and piercing testimony against error.</p>
<p>For the necessary preface to this essay or synodical letter, the reader must turn to the
history of Dionysius of Alexandria, surnamed the Great, and to the letters he wrote to his

namesake of Rome.4 For a complete view of the whole matter, and for the originals of both
these great prelates, the student will not fail to consult Routh.5 Athanasius, the touchstone
of orthodoxy, does not altogether commend the idioms of either; but he sustains the essential
orthodoxy of both with that vast sweep of genius which could insist upon Nicene idioms
after the council, but sustain those who, in defective language, fought previously for essential
truth.</p>
<p>For a just view of Novatian and of the orthodoxy of Rome in the times of Dionysius, as
that unhappy but competent witness sets it forth, the reader would do well to consult Dr.
Waterland.6 For a vindication of the Alexandrian Dionysius, to whom his contemporaries
gave the surname Magnus, see the same lucid expounder of antiquity.7 For a sententious
statement of the subordination of the Son, on which so much hinges in these inquiries,
consult the same theologian.8</p>
<p>I might have suffixed this essay to the works of the great Dionysius but for several important
considerations: (1) I was glad to give due prominence to this exceptional voice from
old Rome, and to place Dionysius with due dignity before the reader; (2) as the Bishop of
Rome was without a hearing at Nicæa, I was anxious to show what good Sylvester would
have said had he been able to attend the council; (3) I was not willing, therefore, to hide this
writer’s light under the bushel of the pages devoted to the Alexandrian school; (4) I was
anxious to close this important volume by a just exhibition of the Ante-Nicene doctrine,
previous to the compilation of the Great Symbol; (5) I considered it judicious to elucidate
Dionysius by the doctrines of Athanasius, to whom we owe the preservation of the fragment
itself; and (6) I felt that here was the place to record the “Athanasian Confession” (so called),
which, apocryphal though it be, as a “creed” under his name is allowed to embody the
principles for which the whole life of Athanasius was a contest unparalleled in the history
of Christianity.</p>

<head>AGAINST THE SABELLIANS.9</head>
<p>1 Now truly it would be just to dispute against those who, by dividing and rending the
monarchy, which is the most august announcement of the Church of God, into, as it were,
three powers, and distinct substances (hypostases), and three deities, destroy it.10 For I have
heard that some who preach and teach the word of God among you are teachers of this
opinion, who indeed diametrically, so to speak, are opposed to the opinion of Sabellius. For
he blasphemes in saying that the Son Himself is the Father, and vice versa; but these in a
certain manner announce three gods, in that they divide the holy unity into three different
substances, absolutely separated from one another. For it is essential that the Divine Word
should be united to the God of all, and that the Holy Spirit should abide and dwell in God;
and thus that the Divine Trinity should be reduced and gathered into one, as if into a certain
head—that is, into the omnipotent God of all. For the doctrine of the foolish Marcion, which
cuts and divides the monarchy into three elements, is assuredly of the devil, and is not of
Christ’s true disciples, or of those to whom the Saviour’s teaching is agreeable. For these
indeed rightly know that the Trinity is declared in the divine Scripture, but that the doctrine
that there are three gods is neither taught in the Old nor in the New Testament.</p>
<p>2 But neither are they less to be blamed who think that the Son was a creation, and decided
that the Lord was made just as one of those things which really were made; whereas
the divine declarations testify that He was begotten, as is fitting and proper, but not that He
was created or made. It is therefore not a trifling, but a very great impiety, to say that the
Lord was in any wise made with hands. For if the Son was made, there was a time when He
was not; but He always was, if, as He Himself declares,11 He is undoubtedly in the Father.
And if Christ is the Word, the Wisdom, and the Power,—for the divine writings tell us that
Christ is these, as ye yourselves know,—assuredly these are powers of God. Wherefore, if
the Son was made, there was a time when these were not in existence;12 and thus there was
a time when God was without these things, which is utterly absurd. But why should I discourse
at greater length to you about these matters, since ye are men filled with the Spirit,
and especially understanding what absurd results follow from the opinion which asserts
that the Son was made? The leaders of this view seem to me to have given very little heed
to these things, and for that reason to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the passage

otherwise than as the divine and prophetic Scripture demands. “The Lord created me the
beginning of His ways.”13 For, as ye know, there is more than one signification of the word
“created;” and in this place “created” is the same as “set over” the works made by Himself—
made, I say, by the Son Himself. But this “created” is not to be understood in the same
manner as “made.” For to make and to create are different from one another. “Is not He
Himself thy Father, that hath possessed thee and created thee?”14 says Moses in the great
song of Deuteronomy. And thus might any one reasonably convict these men. Oh reckless
and rash men! was then “the first-born of every creature”15 something made?—“He who
was begotten from the womb before the morning star?”16—He who in the person of Wisdom
says, “Before all the hills He begot me?”17 Finally, any one may read in many parts of the
divine utterances that the Son is said to have been begotten, but never that He was made.
From which considerations, they who dare to say that His divine and inexplicable generation
was a creation, are openly convicted of thinking that which is false concerning the generation
of the Lord.</p>
<p>3 That admirable and divine unity, therefore, must neither be separated into three divinities,
nor must the dignity and eminent greatness of the Lord be diminished by having
applied to it the name of creation, but we must believe on God the Father Omnipotent, and
on Christ Jesus His Son, and on the Holy Spirit. Moreover, that the Word is united to the
God of all, because He says, “I and the Father are one;”18 and, “I am in the Father, and the
Father is in Me.”19 Thus doubtless will be maintained in its integrity the doctrine of the divine
Trinity, and the sacred announcement of the monarchy.</p>

<head>ELUCIDATIONS.</head>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The Confession, improperly called the “Creed of Athanasius,” is acknowledged to embody
the (Athanasian) doctrine of the Nicene Council; and I append it here as an index to the
state of theology at the period which is the limit of our series. Nothing is properly a “creed”
which has never been accepted as such by the whole Church, and the Greeks knew no other
creed than that called Nicene. The Anglo-American Church has ceased to recite this Confession
in public worship, but does not depart from it as doctrine. The “Reformed” communion
in America20 retains it among her liturgical forms, and I suppose the same is true of the
Lutherans. It is a Western Confession, and, like the Te Deum, is a hymn rather than a symbol,
though breathing the spirit of the Creed.</p>
<p>Usher adopts a.d. 447 as its date, and Beveridge assigns it to the fourth century. Dupin
gives it a later origin than Usher, and a considerable number of eminent authorities agree
with him in the date a.d. 484.</p>
<p>What are called the anathemas are the enacting clauses (so to speak), and, like the same
in the Nicene Creed, may be regarded as no part of the Confession itself. If they have disappeared
from the Great Symbol itself, as unsuitable to liturgical recitation, why not apply the
same rule here?</p>

Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled: without doubt he shall perish

<p>And the Catholick Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in
Unity;</p>
<p>Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the Substance.</p>
<p>For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>But the God-head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one: the Glory
equal, the Majesty co-eternal.</p>
<p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.</p>
<p>As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three un-created: but one un-created,
and one incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the Holy Ghost Almighty.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.</p>
<p>So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord: and the Holy Ghost is Lord.</p>
<p>And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.</p>
<p>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge every Person by
Himself to be God and Lord;</p>
<p>So we are forbidden by the Catholick Religion: to say, there be three Gods, or three
Lords.</p>
<p>The Father is made of none: neither created, nor begotten.</p>
<p>The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son:21 neither made, nor created, nor begotten,
but proceeding.</p>
<p>So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghost, not
three Holy Ghosts.</p>
<p>And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater, or less than another;</p>
<p>But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together: and co-equal.</p>
<p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to
be worshipped.</p>

<p>II.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also believe rightly the Incarnation
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, is God and Man;</p>
<p>God, of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and Man, of the Substance
of His Mother, born in the world;</p>
<note type="footnote">21 The words italicized have never been accepted by the whole Church.</note>

<pb n="834"/>
<p>Perfect God, and perfect Man: of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting;</p>
<p>Equal to the Father, as touching His God-head: and inferior to the Father, as touching
His Manhood.</p>
<p>Who although He be God and Man: yet He is not two, but one Christ;</p>
<p>One; not by conversion of the God-head into flesh: but by taking of the Manhood into
God;</p>
<p>One altogether; not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of Person.</p>
<p>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and Man is one Christ;</p>
<p>Who suffered for our Salvation: descended into hell, rose again the third day from the
dead.</p>
<p>He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty:
from whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies: and shall give account for
their own works.</p>
<p>And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil
into everlasting fire.</p>
<p>¶ This is the Catholick Faith: which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>It is with regret that I am forced to take exception to the most useful Ecclesiastical History
of the learned Professor Schaff, in this connection. I quote from that work22 as follows:—</p>
<p>“He, Dionysius, maintained distinctly, in (a) controversy with Dionysius of Alexandria,
at once the unity of essence and the real personal distinction, etc., . . . and avoided tritheism,
Sabellianism, and (b) subordination, with the instinct of orthodoxy, and also with the art of
anathematizing, (c) already familiar to (d) the popes.”</p>
<p>Such a paragraph must convey to the youthful student a great confusion of ideas; all the
greater, because the same valuable work elsewhere invites him to conclusions quite the reverse.
Thus, (a) there was no controversy whatever between the two Dionysii; with a holy
jealousy they entered into fraternal explanations of the same truth, held by each, but by
neither very technically elucidated. The mere reader would probably infer that the greater
of the two was guilty of tritheism or Sabellianism, although that is not the meaning of these
unguarded expressions. But (b) the “subordinationism” which he repudiated was the doctrine
of the subjection of the Son, not of the subordination, which orthodoxy has always maintained.
<note type="footnote">22 Vol. ii. p. 570.</note>

<pb n="835"/>
Again, (c) I see no such “anathematizing” in the letter of Dionysius as is here charged; indeed,
it contains no anathema23 whatever, much less the artificial cursing of the Papacy which is
thus assumed. And last, (d) what can be meant by the expression, “already familiar to the
popes?” The learned pages of the same author sufficiently prove that there were no such
things24 as “popes” till a much later period of history; and, as to the “art of anathematizing,”
if it existed at all in those days, we find it much more freely exemplified by the Greek Fathers
than by bishops of Rome. I say, if it existed at all, because the primitive anathema was a
purely scriptural enforcement of St. Paul’s great canon (Gal. i. 8, 9); while the “art of anathematizing,”
so justly credited to “the popes,” was a vindictive and monstrous assertion,
at a later date, of prerogatives which they impiously arrogated to themselves, against other
churches.</p>

<head>THE TEACHING OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.</head>

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE
TO
THE TEACHING OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.</head>
<p>The interest so generally excited in the learned world by the (“Bryennios”) discovery of
a very primitive document, rendered it indispensable that this republication should be enriched
by it, in connection with the Apostolic Constitutions (so called), which had been reserved
for the concluding volume of the series. The critics were greatly divided as to the
genuineness of the Bryennios ms ; and, in order to gain time, I had relegated the Constitutions,
with this document as its sequel or its preface, to a place with the Apocrypha Dissatisfied
with my own impressions and conjectures, I soon decided that the task of editing the
Teaching, as the Bryennios document is entitled, must be entrusted to an “expert,” and that,
if possible, it should be taken in hand with the Constitutions In order to give sufficient time,
I entrusted the task, a year ago, to the well-qualified head and hands of Professor Riddle of
Hartford, who most kindly accepted my proposals, and who now enables me to present his
completed work to the public with the volume to which it properly belongs. It will be hailed
by literary men generally as a timely reviewal of the whole subject, nor should I be surprised
to find Dr. Riddle’s estimate of the Teaching accepted as the most important contribution
yet made to the literature of inquiry touching its worth and character. Appearing, as it does
in this place, in close relations with the Constitutions, and with the editorial comparisons
so felicitously introduced by the learned annotator, the student will find himself in a position
to weigh and to decide for himself all the questions that have been raised in previous examinations
of the case. Without risking any judgment of my own upon the decisions which
have been reached by Dr. Riddle in the exercise of his great critical skill, I cannot withhold
an expression of gratitude for the impartiality and scientific conscientiousness with which
he has handled the matter. Uninfluenced by prepossessions, he presents the case with judicial
calmness and with due consideration of what others have suggested. I am gratified to find
that impressions of my own are strengthened by his conclusions. In an early notice of the
Bryennios discovery, contributed to a leading publication, I stated my surmise that the
Teaching, and its parallels in the Constitutions and other primitive writings, would prove
to be based upon some original document, common to all. Even Lactantius, in his Institutes,
shapes his instructions to Constantine by the Duoe Vioe, which seem to have been formulated
in the earliest ages for the training of catechumens. The elementary nature and the “child-

<pb n="838"/>
ishness” of the work are thus accounted for, and I am sure that the “mystagogic” teaching
of Cyril receives light from this view of the matter. This work was “food for lambs:” it was
not meant to meet the wants of those “of full age.” It may prove, as Dr. Riddle hints, that
the Teaching as we have it, in the Bryennios document, is tainted by the views of some nascent
sect or heresy, or by the incompetency of some obscure local church as yet unvisited by
learned teachers and evangelists. It seems to me not improbably influenced by views of the
charismata, which ripened into Montanism, and which are illustrated by the warnings and
admonitions of Hermas.234</p>
<note type="footnote">234 The reader has observed that all my notes, except the “General Notes,” are bracketed when they illustrate
any other text except that of my own original prefaces, elucidations, etc. This rule will apply to Professor Riddle’s

<head>SECTION 1.—THE DISCOVERY OF THE CODEX, AND ITS CONTENTS.</head>
<p>In 1873 Philotheos Bryennios, then Head Master of the higher Greek school at Constantinople,
but now Metropolitan of Nicomedia, discovered a remarkable collection of
manuscripts in the library of the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople.
This collection is bound in one volume, and written by the same hand. It is
signed “Leon, notary and sinner,” and bears the Greek date of 6564 = a.d. 1056. There is no
reason to doubt the age of the manuscripts. The documents have been examined by Professor
Albert L. Long of Robert College, Constantinople;235 and some of the pages, reproduced
by photography, were published by the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, April, 1885.
The jealousy of its guardians does not imply any lack of confidence in the age and value of
the Codex. The contents of the 120 folios (240 pp.) are as follows:—</p>
<p>I. Synopsis of the Old and New Testaments,
by St. Chrysostom (fol. 1–32).</p>
<p>II. The Epistle of Barnabas (fol. 33–51b).</p>
<p>III. The two Epistles of Clement to the Corinthians
fol. 51b-76a).</p>
<p>IV. The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (fol.
76a-80).</p>
<p>V. The Epistle of Mary of Cassoboli to
Ignatius (fol. 81–82a).</p>
<p>VI Twelve Epistles of Ignatius (fol.
82a-120a).</p>
<p>The last part of fol. 120a contains the signature and date; then follows an account of the
genealogy of Joseph, continued on the other page of the leaf.</p>
<p>Schaff (p. 6) gives a facsimile of fol. 120a.</p>
<p>Of these, I. supplies some unpublished portions, and furnishes matter for textual criticism.
II. gives the second Greek copy of Barnabas, also furnishing new readings. III. is very
valuable; the text of both Epistles is now complete. Two-fifths of that of the second was
previously unknown.236 The value for purposes of textual criticism is also great. IV. is the
Teaching, the value of which is discussed below. V. and VI. both belong to the Ignatian literature,
and furnish new readings, which have already appeared in the editions of Funk
(Opera Patr. Apost., ii., Tübingen, 1881) and Lightfoot (Epistles of St. Ignatius, London and
Cambridge, 1885).</p>

<head>SECTION 2.—PUBLICATION OF THE DISCOVERED WORKS: THE EFFECT.</head>
<p>In 1875 Bryennios, who had been chosen Metropolitan of Serræ during his absence at
the Old Catholic conference in Bonn, published at Constantinople the two Epistles of
Clement, with prolegomena and notes; giving the text found in the Jerusalem Codex, as he
termed it. All patristic scholars welcomed his work, which bore every mark of care and
learning; showing the results of his contact, as a student, with German methods. Bishop
Lightfoot and many others at once made use of this new material. The remaining contents
of the Codex were named in the volume of Bryennios, and some interest awakened by the
mention of the Teaching. The learned Metropolitan furnished new readings from other
parts of the Codex to German scholars. At the close of 1883 he published in Constantinople
the text of the Teaching, with prolegomena and notes. A copy of the volume was received
in Germany in January, 1884; was translated into German, and published Feb. 3, 1884;
translated from German into English, and published in America, Feb. 28, 1884; Archdeacon
Farrar published (Contemporary Review) a version from the Greek in May, 1884. Before the
close of the year the literature on the subject, exclusive of newspaper articles, covered fifty
titles (given by Schaff) in Western Europe and America.237</p>

<pb n="842"/>
<head>SECTION 3.—CONTENTS OF TEACHING, AND RELATION TO OTHER WORKS.</head>
<p>In the Babel of conflicting opinions, it is best to notice first the obvious internal phenomena.
The first part of the Teaching (now distinguished as chaps. i.-vi.) sets forth the duty of
the Christian; in chaps. vii.-x., xiv., we find a directory for worship; chaps. xi.-xiii., xv., give
advice respecting church officers, extraordinary and local, and the reception of Christians;
the closing chapter (xvi.) enjoins watchfulness in view of the coming of Christ, which is
then described.</p>
<p>The amount of matter is not so great as that of the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of language are marked, but can only be indicated here in footnotes.
They point to a period of transition from New-Testament usage to that of ecclesiastical
Greek. The citations from the Scriptures resemble those of the Apostolic Fathers. The Gospel
of Matthew is most frequently used, especially chaps. v.-vii. and xxiv.; but some of the passages
fairly imply a knowledge of the Gospel of Luke. There are some remarkable correspondences
with expressions and thoughts found in the Gospel of John, while there is good
reason for inferring the writer’s acquaintance with all the groups of Pauline Epistles. His
allusions to the other New-Testament books are less marked. There is nothing to prove that
he did not know all of our canonical books. If an early date is accepted, the tone of the whole
opposes the tendency-theory of the Tübingen school.</p>
<p>The most striking internal phenomena are, however, the correspondences of this document
with early Christian writings, from a.d. 125 to the fourth century. With the so-called
Epistle to Barnabas, chaps. xviii.-xx., the resemblances are so marked as to demand a critical
theory which can account for them. A few passages in the Shepherd of Hermas show some
resemblance; but only two sentences, in Commandment Second, are verbally the same.
There is a still greater agreement with the so-called Apostolical Church Order, of Egyptian
origin, probably as old as the third century. It is now known in the Coptic (Memphitic),
and also in Arabic and Greek.238 The first thirteen canons correspond quite closely, both
in order and words, with chaps. i.-iv. of the Teaching</p>
<p>Most noteworthy, however, is the parallel with the Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 1–32,
which contain more than half the Teaching, in precisely the same order, with very close verbal
resemblances. The parts omitted are in most cases such as had lost their pertinence in the
fourth century, while they seem appropriate to a much earlier period. The details will be found
in the footnotes to the Teaching in this volume. These phenomena have called forth voluminous
discussions, and are the most important facts in determining the authenticity and age of the
Teaching</p>
<note type="footnote">238 The Church Order is to be distinguished from the Ethiopic collection of Apostolic canons; see Introductory
Notice to Apostolic Constitutions.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<pb n="843"/>
<head>SECTION 4.—AUTHENTICITY.</head>
<p>By this is meant, in this case, the substantial identity of the recently discovered document
with the work known and referred to by early Christian writers under the same (or a similar)
title. Of apostolic origin no one should presume to speak, since the text of the document
makes no such claim, and internal evidence is obviously against such a suggestion. On the
other hand, there is no reason for doubting the age of the Codex, or the accuracy of the
edition published by Bryennios.</p>
<p>Eusebius (d. 340) of Cæsarea, in the famous passage of his history (iii. 25) which treats
of the canonical books of the New Testament, names among the “spurious” works (νόθοι)
“the so-called Teachings of the Apostles” (τω̑ν ἀποστόλων αἱ λεγόμεναι διδαχαί). The
plural form does not forbid a reference to the work under discussion, since Athanasius (d.
373) has a notice clearly pointing to the same writing, in which he uses the singular (Festal
Epistle, 39). Rufinus (d. 410) speaks of a brief work called The Two Ways, or The Judgment
of Peter; and this fact, in view of the contents of the Teaching, furnishes one of the most
important data for the critical discussion. The last notice of the Teaching was made by
Nicephorus (d. 828) more than two hundred years before Leon made this copy. Clement of
Alexandria (d. circa 216) and Irenæus (mart. 202) use expressions that may indicate an acquaintance
with this writing. The more extended correspondences with Barnabas and later
disciplinary works are noticed above (sec. 3). The existence of an old Latin translation of
the Teaching, of the tenth century, a fragment of which has been preserved, furnishes general
evidence to the authenticity of the Greek copy, but by its variations suggests the presence
of many textual corruptions. Its closer correspondence with Barnabas has led to the theory
that the translator used both documents. Others suppose that its form points to a document
which was the common source of the Greek form of the Teaching and of Barnabas.</p>
<p>The various theories based on the above facts cannot even be stated. The following positions
seem, on the whole, most tenable:—</p>
<p>1. The Greek Codex presents substantially the writing referred to by Eusebius and
Athanasius.</p>
<p>2. Owing to an absence of other copies, we cannot determine the purity of the text; but
there is every probability of many minor corruptions.</p>
<p>3. This probability calls for care that we do not infer too much from verbal resemblances.</p>
<p>4. The resemblances to book vii., Apostolic Constitutions, are, however, of such a character
as establish, not only a literary connection between the two works, but also the priority
of the Teaching</p>
<p>5. In the case of Barnabas, the resemblances can be accounted for (a) by accepting the
priority of the Teaching, or (b) by assuming a common (earlier and unknown) source, or (c)
by accepting the priority of Barnabas, and assuming such corruptions in the Greek copy of the

<pb n="844"/>
Teaching as will account for the supposed marks of its priority. Despite the general adoption
of (a), there remains a strong probability that (b) is the correct solution of the problem.</p>
<p>6. The Duæ Viæ, spoken of by Rufinus, may be the common source. We have no positive
evidence, but the “two ways” form so prominent a topic in most of these documents which
indicate literary relationship, as to encourage this theory. If there was a common source, it
probably contained only matter similar to chaps. i.-v., which was variously used by the
subsequent compilers. Here a number of theories have been suggested.239 None of them,
however, necessarily call for a very late date of the Teaching, or compel us to deny that
Eusebius and Athanasius referred to substantially the same work as that now existing in the
Codex at Constantinople. Many resemblances have been noticed in other works. Probably
in the course of a few years all the data will have been collected, and a well-defined result
based upon them. But, even in this period of discussion, there is remarkable agreement
among critics in regard to the main question of authenticity.</p>

Review, vol. v. pp. 430–442.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<pb n="845"/>
<head>SECTION 5.—TIME AND PLACE OF COMPOSITION.</head>
<p>Granting the general authenticity of the Greek work, the time of composition must be
at least as early as the first half of the second century. If the Teaching is older than Barnabas,
then it cannot be later than a.d. 120. If both are from a common source, the interval of time
was probably not very great.240 The document itself bears many marks of an early date:—</p>
<p>(1) Its simplicity, almost amounting to childishness, not only discountenances all idea
of forgery, but points to the sub-apostolic age, during which Christianity manifested this
characteristic. The fact is an important one in the discussion of the canon of the New Testament.</p>
<p>(2) The undeveloped Christian thought, as well as the indications of undeveloped
heresy,241 confirms this position. Christianity was at first a life, for which the Apostles furnished
a basis of revealed thought. But the Christians of the sub-apostolic age had not consciously
assimilated the thought to any large extent, while their ethical striving was stimulated
by the gross sins surrounding them.242</p>
<p>(3) The Church polity indicated in the Teaching is less developed than that of the
genuine Ignatian Epistles, and shows the existence of extraordinary travelling teachers
(“Apostles” and “Prophets,” chap. xi.). This points to a date not later than the first half of
the second century, probably as early as the first quarter.243</p>
<p>Most of these phenomena would, however, consist with a date as late as that of the Ignatian
Epistles on the theory that the Teaching was written for a community of Christians
in some obscure locality. But this theory must admit that there existed for a long time great
variety of Church polity and worship.244 Of this there is, indeed, considerable evidence.
The undeveloped form of the doctrinal elements of the work constitutes the most serious
objection to the theory of a late origin. On the other hand, it seems on many accounts improbable
that the work, in its present form, was written earlier than the beginning of the
second century: (1) Such a document would not be penned during the lifetime of any of the
Apostles. (2) There is no allusion in chap. xvi. to the destruction of Jerusalem. If the author
was a Jewish Christian, as seems most probable, such silence implies an interval of at least
one generation. (3) The position of the document in the Codex is after the Clementine
Epistles, and before the Ignatian. This probably marks the chronological position. (4) The

<pb n="846"/>
extreme simplicity scarcely consists with the view that the author was nearly contemporary
with the Apostles.</p>
<p>Bryennios and Harnack assign, as the date, between 120 and 160; Hilgenfeld, 160 and
190; English and American scholars vary between a.d. 80 and 120. Until the priority to
Barnabas is more positively established, the two may be regarded as of the same age, about
120, although a date slightly later is not impossible. All attempts to discover the author are,
with our present lack of data, necessarily futile. Even the region in and for which it was
composed cannot be determined. Jewish-Christian tendencies are not sufficiently indicated
to warrant the assumption of a polemical aim.245 The document has been assigned to Alexandria,
to Antioch, to Jerusalem; indeed, many other places have been named. In favour of
the Syrian origin is the literary connection with the Apostolic Constitutions, while the correspondences
with the Epistle to Barnabas suggest Egypt as the locality. If the Teaching and
Barnabas have a common basis, e.g., the Duæ Viæ, the last may be assigned to Egypt, and
the Teaching, in its present form, to Syria. The Palestinian origin is urged by those who lay
stress upon the absence of Pauline doctrine in the Teaching <del>If meant for catechumens only,
this fact is sufficiently accounted for.</del></p>
<p>The question is still an open one.</p>
<p>As regards the doctrine, polity, usages, and ethics expressed and implied in the Teaching,
the reader can judge for himself. The writer is of the opinion that the work represents, on
many of these points, only a very small fraction of the Christians during the second century,
and that, while it casts some light upon usages of that period, it cannot be regarded as an
authoritative witness concerning the universal faith and practice of believers at the date
usually assigned to it. The few notices of it, and its 
early disappearance, confirm this position.
The theory of a composite origin also accords with this estimate of the document as a whole.</p>
<p>The version of the Teaching here given is that of Professor Isaac H. Hall and Mr. John
T. Napier, which first appeared in the Sunday-School Times (Philadelphia), April 12, 1884.
It is now republished by permission of the editor of that periodical and of the joint authors.
A few slight changes have been made, some of them in accordance with suggestions from
Professor Hall, others to indicate correspondences with book vii. of Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
<p>The division of verses agrees with that of Harnack as given by Schaff. The headings to
the chapters have been inserted by the editor. The Scripture references have been selected
and verified. The notes have been kept within narrow limits. They serve to indicate the relation
of the matter to that in other early writings, mainly the Apostolic Constitutions, and to
give various readings and renderings. Occasionally explanations and comments have been

<pb n="847"/>
inserted. In dealing with this, as with most other books, the best method of study is historicoexegetical.
To read the book intelligently is better than to read about it. The editor has sought
to furnish some help in this method.</p>

ethical side of Christianity to the exclusion of its doctrinal basis, it disappeared very soon. From the nature of

faith and immortality, which Thou madest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee

interpretations either rest on textual emendations or are open to grammatical objections. Of the two given above,
that of Hall and Napier seems preferable.</note>
<note type="footnote">394 “Truth” might refer to Christ Himself, but the personal advent is spoken of in verse 8; it is better, then,
to refer it to the truth respecting the parousia held by the early Christians. For this belief they were mocked, and
hence dwelt upon it and the prophecies respecting it. The verse is probably based upon Matt. xxiv. 30, 31; but
some find here, as in verse 4, an allusion to Paul’s eschatological statements in the Epistles to the Thessalonians.</note>
<note type="footnote">395 Professor Hall now prefers to render ἐκπετάσεως, “outspreading,” instead of “unrolling,” as in his version
originally. Hitchcock and Brown, Schaff, and others, prefer “opening;” that is, the apparent o pening in heaven
through which the Lord will descend. “Outspreading” is usually explained (so Professor Hall) as meaning the
expanded sign of the cross in the heavens, the patristic interpretation of Matt. xxiv. 30. Bryennios and Farrar
refer it to the flying forth of the saints to meet the Lord. There are other interpretations based on textual
emendations. As the word is very rare, it is difficult to determine the exact sense. “Opening” seems lexically allowable
and otherwise free from objection.</note>

to the first resurrection. Comp. 1 Thess. iv. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 23; Rev. xx. 5. Probably it is based upon the Pauline
eschatology rather than upon that of the Apocalypse. At all events, there is no allusion to the millennial statement
of the latter. Since there was in the early Church, in connection with the expectation of the speedy coming of
Christ, a marked tendency to Chiliasm, the silence respecting the millennium may indicate that the writer was
not acquainted with the Apocalypse. This inference is allowable, however, only on the assumption of the early
date of the Teaching.</note>
<note type="footnote">397 Comp. Matt. xxiv. 30. The conclusion is abrupt, and in Apostolic Constitutions the New-Testament
doctrine of future punishment and reward is added. The absence of all reference to the destruction of Jerusalem
would indicate that some time had elapsed since that event. An interval of from thirty to sixty years may well
be claimed.</note>

<p>I
(Thus baptize ye, p. 379.)</p>
<p>If we compare this chapter with the corresponding one in the Apostolic Constitutions,
the Teaching seems to me to be a somewhat abridged form of a common original. This being
designed for the catechumens, there is an omission of what they are afterwards to know. A
form originally drawn up for clergy and people has been very inartificially expurgated for
the instruction of young disciples. This appears from the ninth chapter (p. 380), where only
certain receptive or responsive forms are given. The liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutions,
book viii., embodies what was studiously kept from all but the τέλειοι, i.e., those “of full
age.”</p>

<p>II
(Concerning Apostles, p. 380, note 16.)</p>
<p>The reference to “apostles,” probably itinerant, in Rev. ii. 2, corresponds with this. There
were officers known in the Apostolic day (compare 2 Cor. viii. 23, Greek) as ἀπόστολοι
ἐκκλησιω̑ν, for the pseud-apostles of the Apocalypse could not have pretended what they
did had it been otherwise. Neither would it have been needful to “try those who said they
were apostles,” in that case: the mere assertion of such a pretence would have sufficiently
convicted them.</p>
<p>The very childish directions (suited to mere catechumens) given in the text illustrates
Rev ii. 2, and is, so far, evidence of the very early origin of the Teaching.</p>
<p>The name apostles was made technical by Christ Himself: “He named them Apostles”
(Luke vi. 13). And the word is never used in the loose way which Bishop Lightfoot hazardously
suggests, as I must venture to believe.</p>

(Incipient fanaticism, p. 381, note 25.)</p>
<p>Unquestionably, for even in St. Paul’s day his admonitions imply nothing less. See 1
Cor. cap. xiv., passim. But, as in the Introductory Notice398 I hinted my suspicions of incipient
Montanism in the Teaching, so I am strengthened in this idea by the learned critic to
whose note I venture to append this remark for the purpose of asking a reference to my
annotations of Hermas in vol. ii. of this series. May I also ask a reference to the same volume,
pp. 4, 5, and 6? The “meal” (note 23, p. 380) of the Teaching is doubtless the Agape, which

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE
TO
CONSTITUTIONS OF THE HOLY APOSTLES.</head>
<p>Having learned from the erudite Beveridge what I long supposed to be a just view of
the Constitutions, I have found in the recent literature of the subject not a little to increase
my confidence in the general conclusions to which he was led by all that could be known
in his times. The treatise of Krabbe guided me to some results of more modern investigations;
and Dr. Bunsen, though not apart from his critics, has enabled me still further to correct
some of my impressions. But, in connection with the late discovery of Bryennios, the field
of discussion and inquiry has been so much enlarged, that I have felt it due to the readers
and students of this republication to invoke the aid of Professor Riddle, who is able to enrich
the work with the results of genuine learning and much patient research. Whatever may be
my own convictions on some subordinate points, I have been glad to secure the judgment
of a critical scholar who, I am persuaded, aims to shed upon the subject the colourless light
of scientific investigation. This is all I can desire, anxious only to see facts clearly established
and historic truth illustrated, no matter to what results they may seem to point. Where the
professor’s decisions coincide with my own impressions, I am naturally gratified by his
valued and independent corroboration: where the case is otherwise, I am hardly less gratified
to present my indulgent readers with opinions deserving of their highest respect, and by
which they will be stimulated, as well as influenced, in forming convictions for themselves.</p>
<p>The Constitutions are so full of material on which it is well for one in my position not
to speak very freely in such a work as this, that I rejoice all the more to confide the task of
annotation almost exclusively to another and to one from whom American Christians must
ever be glad to hear on subjects requiring in an almost equal degree the skill of an expert
critic and the candour of a conscientious Christian.</p>
<p>I prefix Professor Riddle’s Preface to the Introductory Notice of the Edinburgh editor,
as follows:—</p>
<p>New interest has been awakened in the Apostolic Constitutions by the discovery of an
ancient manuscript in Constantinople.401 While it does not contain the Constitutions, it
<note type="footnote">401 See the brief account prefixed to the version of the Teaching, p. 372, supra.</note>

<pb n="873"/>
affords much material for discussion respecting the sources and authorship of this compilation.
The so-called Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, found in the Codex at Constantinople,
and published by Bryennios in 1883, is recognised as the basis of the seventh book of the
Constitutions. The verbal coincidences, the order of topics, and other obvious phenomena,
leave little room for reasonable doubt on this point. That the reader may be in possession
of the main facts, the corresponding portions have been indicated both in book vii. of the
Constitutions and in the version of the Teaching inserted in this volume. This literary con-
nection has some bearing on the discussion as to the age of the Constitutions. If the Teaching
is substantially the early work bearing that name, then some of the references by early writers
which have been applied to the larger work must now be regarded as pointing to the
Teaching; still, this only bears against the theory of a date as early as the third century. The
new critical material furnished by the Bryennios manuscript for the Ignatian controversy
has a bearing on the question respecting the work before us. The opinion has been
strengthened (see below), that the same hand enlarged the Ignatian Epistles and adapted
earlier matter (such as the Teaching) for the Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
<p>We may accept as established the following positions:—</p>
<p>1. The Apostolic Constitutions are a compilation, the material being derived from sources
differing in age.</p>
<p>2. The first six books are the oldest; the seventh, in its present form, somewhat later,
but, from its connection with the Teaching, proven to contain matter of a very ancient date.
The eighth book is of latest date.</p>
<p>3. It now seems to be generally admitted that the entire work is not later than the fourth
century, although the usual allowance must be made for later textual changes, whether by
accident or design.</p>
<p>Dr. Von Drey402 regards the first six books as of Eastern origin (mainly Syrian), and to
be assigned to the second half of the third century. The seventh and eighth were more recent,
he thinks, but united with the others before a.d. 325. With this, Schaff (in his Church History,
vol. ii, rev. ed., p. 185) substantially agreed; but, in his later work on the Teaching, seems to
assign the completion of the compilation to a date somewhat later. This is the view of
Harnack, who, “by a critical analysis and comparison, comes to the conclusion403 that
pseudo-Clement, alias pseudo-Ignatius, was a Eusebian, a semi-Arian, and rather worldlyminded
anti-ascetic Bishop of Syria, a friend of the Emperor Constantius between 340 and
360; that he enlarged and adapted the Didascalia of the third and the Didache of the second

<pb n="874"/>
century, as well as the Ignatian Epistles, to his own view of morals, worship, and discipline,
and clothed them with Apostolic authority.”404</p>
<p>This is, at all events, a more reasonable view than that of Krabbe, who assigns the first
six books to the end of the third century, and the eighth to the beginning of the fifth. The
latter, it is true, he regards a compilation from older sources. The purpose of the whole, in
his view, was to confirm the episcopal hierarchy, and to establish the unity of the Catholic
Church on the basis of the unity of the priesthood, etc. But it is now generally held that the
purpose of the compilation was merely to present a manual of instruction, worship, polity,
and usage for both clergy and laity. Had it been designed to further some ecclesiastical
tendency, it would be far less valuable, since it would less fairly reproduce the ecclesiastical
life of the age or ages in which it originated. Bishop Beveridge at first attributed the Constitutions
to Clemens Alexandrinus (end of second century), but afterwards accepted the third
century as the more probable date. The views now prevalent do full justice to his opinions,
but seem to be better sustained in detail.</p>
<p>The collection of Canons at the close of the Constitutions is undoubtedly a compilation.
Some are evidently much more ancient than others, and there is every evidence that various
collections or recensions existed. That of Dionysius (about a.d. 500), in Latin, contained
fifty canons; that of John (Scholasticus) of Antioch (about a.d. 565) contained eighty-five
canons: and “it is undeniable that the Greek copy which Dionysius had before him belonged
to a different family of collections from that used by John Scholasticus, for they differ frequently,
if not essentially, both in text and in the way of numbering the canons.”405</p>
<p>Bishop Beveridge sought to trace these to the synods of the first two centuries, while
Daillé held that the collection was made as late as the fifth century. The latter view is not
generally accepted, though the existence of a variety of collections tells against some of the
views of Bishop Beveridge.406 It is impossible to enter into a full discussion here. It seemed

use of the edition of Winand Fell (Cologne, 1871) with a Latin version. The Canons in this form contain most

fifty-seven, in many cases several Greek canons being combined as one in the Ethiopic. Some modifications are

better to annotate the Canons from the results of Drey and Hefele, two most candid and
scholarly Roman-Catholic investigators.407 The brief notes indicate the sources according
to these authors. The reader will at once perceive from the views thus suggested, as well as
from the contents of the Canons, that, while some canons are presumably quite ancient, a
number belong to the fourth century, and that, as a complete collection, they cannot antedate
the compilation of the Apostolic Constitutions. Indeed, Drey, who accepts the latter as Ante-
Nicene (see above), thinks five of the canons (30, 67, 74, 81, 83) were derived from the
canons of the Fourth OEcumenical Council at Chalcedon, a.d. 451, and quite a number of
others he traces to synods and councils of the fourth century. Hefele doubts the positions
taken by Drey in regard to most of these. He does not, however, insist that the collection is
Ante-Nicene, while he traces the origin of many of the canons to the Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
<p><del>The following is Dr. Donaldson’s Introductory Notice:—</del></p>
<p>There has always existed a great diversity of opinion as to the author and date of the
Apostolical Constitutions Earlier writers were inclined to assign them to the apostolic age,
and to Clement; but much discussion ensued, and the questions to which they give rise are
still unsettled.</p>
<p>The most peculiar opinion in regard to them is that of Whiston, who devoted a volume
(vol. iii.) of his Primitive Christianity Revived to prove that “they are the most sacred of the
canonical books of the New Testament;” for “these sacred Christian laws or constitutions
were delivered at Jerusalem, and in Mount Sion, by our Saviour to the eleven apostles there
assembled after His resurrection.”</p>
<p>Krabbe, who wrote an elaborate treatise on the origin and contents of the Apostolical
Constitutions, tried to show that the first seven books were written “towards the end of the
third century.” The eighth book, he thinks, must have been written at the end of the fourth
or beginning of the fifth.</p>
<p>Bunsen thinks that, if we expunge a few interpolations of the fourth and fifth centuries,
“we find ourselves unmistakeably in the midst of the life of the Church of the second and
third centuries.”408 “I think,” he says, “I have proved in my analysis, more clearly than has
been hitherto done, the Ante-Nicene origin of a book, or rather books, called by an early
fiction Apostolical Constitutions, and consequently the still higher antiquity of the materials,
both ecclesiastical and literary, which they contain. I have shown that the compilers made
use of the Epistle of Barnabas,409 which belongs to the first half of the second century; that

<note type="footnote">409 [Evidently the Teaching must now be substituted for the Epistle of Barnabas.—R.]</note>

<pb n="876"/>
the eighth is an extract or transcript of Hippolytus; and that the first six books are so full of
phrases found in the second interpolation of the Ignatian Epistles, that their last compiler,
the author of the present text, must either have lived soon after that interpolation was made,
or vice versa, or the interpolator and compiler must have been one and the same person.410
This last circumstance renders it probable that at least the first six books of the Greek
compilation, like the Ignatian forgeries,411 were the produce of Asia Minor. Two points are
self-evident—their Oriental origin, and that they belong neither to Antioch nor to Alexandria.
I suppose nobody now will trace them to Palestine.”412</p>
<p>Modern critics are equally at sea in determining the date of the collections of canons
given at the end of the eighth book. Most believe that some of them belong to the apostolic
age, while others are of a comparatively late date. The subject is very fully discussed in
Krabbe.</p>
<p>Bovius first gave a complete edition of the Constitutions (Venice, 1563), but only in a
Latin form. The Greek was first edited by the Jesuit Turrianus (Venice, 1563). It was reprinted
several times. Cotelerius gave it in his Apostolical Fathers. In the second edition of this work,
as prepared by Clericus (1724), the readings of two Vienna manuscripts were given. These
V. mss. and Oxford ms. of book viii. are supposed by Bunsen to be nearer the original than
the others, alike in what they give and in what they omit. The Constitutions have been edited
by Ültzen (1853), and by Lagarde in Bunsen’s Analecta Ante-Nicoena, vol. ii. (1854). Lagarde
has partially introduced readings from the Syriac, Arabic, Æthiopic, and Coptic forms of
the Constitutions. Whiston devoted the second volume of his Primitive Christianity to the
Constitutions and Canons, giving both the Greek and English. It is his translation which we
have republished, with considerable alterations. We have not deemed it necessary to give a
tithe of the various readings, but have confined ourselves to those that seem important. We
have also given no indication of the Syriac form of the first six books. We shall give this
form by itself. The translation of Whiston was reprinted by Irah Chase, D.D., very carefully
revised, with a translation of Krabbe’s Essay on the Origin and Contents of the Constitutions,
and his Dissertation on the Canons (New York, 1848).413</p>

everlasting kingdom; who are partakers of His divine influence, and of the communication

<p>I. Abstain, therefore, from all unlawful desires and injustice. For it is written in the law,
“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maidservant,
nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour’s;”417 for all coveting of
these things is from the evil one. For he that covets his neighbour’s wife, or his man-servant,
or his maid-servant, is already in his mind an adulterer and a thief; and if he does not repent,
is condemned by our Lord Jesus Christ: through whom418 glory be to God for ever, Amen.
For He says in the Gospel, recapitulating, and confirming, and fulfilling the ten commandments
of the law: “It is written in the law, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto
you, that is, I said in the law, by Moses. But now I say unto you myself, Whosoever shall
look on his neighbour’s wife to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in
his heart.”419 Such a one is condemned of adultery, who covets his neighbour’s wife in his
mind. But does not he that covets an ox or an ass design to steal them? to apply them to his
own use, and to lead them away? Or, again, does not he that covets a field, and continues

in such a disposition, wickedly contrive how to remove the landmarks, and to compel the
possessor to part with somewhat for nothing? For as the prophet somewhere speaks: “Woe
to those who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may deprive their neighbour
of somewhat which was his.”420 Wherefore he says: “Must you alone inhabit the earth? For
these things have been heard in the ears of the Lord of hosts.” And elsewhere: “Cursed be
he who removeth his neighbour’s landmarks: and all the people shall say, Amen.”421
Wherefore Moses says: “Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmarks422 which thy
fathers have set.”423 Upon this account, therefore, terrors, death, tribunals, and condemnations
follow such as these from God. But as to those who are obedient to God, there is one
law of God, simple,424 true, living, which is this: “Do not that to another which thou hatest
another should do to thee.”425 Thou wouldst not that any one should look upon thy wife
with an evil design to corrupt her; do not thou, therefore, look upon thy neighbour’s wife
with a wicked intention. Thou wouldst not that thy garment should be taken away; do not
thou, therefore, take away another’s. Thou wouldst not be beaten, reproached, affronted;
do not thou, therefore, serve any other in the like manner.</p>

<head>CONCERNING THE ADORNMENT OF OURSELVES, AND THE SIN WHICH ARISES
FROM THENCE.</head>
<p>Let the husband not be insolent nor arrogant towards his wife; but compassionate,
bountiful, willing to please his own wife alone,430 and treat her honourably and obligingly,
endeavouring to be agreeable to her; (III.) not adorning thyself in such a manner as may
entice another woman to thee. For if thou art overcome by her, and sinnest with her,
eternal death will overtake thee from God; and thou wilt be punished with sensible and
bitter torments. Or if thou dost not perpetrate such a wicked act, but shakest her off, and
refusest her, in this case thou art not wholly innocent, even though thou art not guilty of
the crime itself, but only in so far as through thy adorning thou didst entice the woman to
desire thee. For thou art the cause that the woman was so affected, and by her lusting after
thee was guilty of adultery with thee: yet art thou not so guilty, because thou didst not send
to her, who was ensnared by thee; nor didst thou desire her. Since, therefore, thou didst not
deliver up thyself to her, thou shalt find mercy with the Lord thy God, who hath said, “Thou
shalt not commit adultery,” and, “Thou shalt not covet.”431 For if such a woman, upon sight
of thee, or unseasonable meeting with thee, was smitten in her mind, and sent to thee, but
thou as a religious person didst refuse her,432 if she was wounded in her heart by thy beauty,
and youth, and adorning, and fell in love with thee, thou wilt be found guilty of her transgressions,
as having been the occasion of scandal to her,433 and shalt inherit a woe.434
Wherefore pray thou to the Lord God that no mischief may befall thee upon this account:
for thou art not to please men, so as to commit sin; but God, so as to attain holiness of life,
and be partaker of everlasting rest. That beauty which God and nature has bestowed on
thee, do not further beautify; but modestly diminish it before men. Thus, do not thou permit
the hair of thy head to grow too long, but rather cut it short; lest by a nice combing thy hair,
and wearing it long, and anointing thyself, thou draw upon thyself such ensnared or ensnaring
women. Neither do thou wear over-fine garments to seduce any; neither do thou, with an
evil subtilty, affect over-fine stockings or shoes for thy feet, but only such as suit the measures
of decency and usefulness. Neither do thou put a gold ring upon thy fingers; for all these
ornaments are the signs of lasciviousness, which if thou be solicitous about in an indecent
manner, thou wilt not act as becomes a good man: for it is not lawful for thee, a believer

and a man of God, to permit the hair of thy head to grow long, and to brush it up together,
nor to suffer it to spread abroad, nor to puff it up, nor by nice combing and platting to make
it curl and shine; since that is contrary to the law, which says thus, in its additional precepts:
“You shall not make to yourselves curls and round rasures.”435 Nor may men destroy the
hair of their beards, and unnaturally change the form of a man. For the law says: “Ye shall
not mar your beards.”436 For God the Creator has made this decent for women, but has
determined that it is unsuitable for men. But if thou do these things to please men, in contradiction
to the law, thou wilt be abominable with God, who created thee after His own
image. If, therefore, thou wilt be acceptable to God, abstain from all those things which He
hates, and do none of those things that are unpleasing to Him.</p>

fables? For if thou hast a mind to read history, thou hast the books of the Kings; if books of
wisdom or poetry, thou hast those of the Prophets, of Job, and the Proverbs, in which thou
wilt find greater depth of sagacity than in all the heathen poets and sophisters, because these
are the words of the Lord, the only wise God. If thou desirest something to sing, thou hast
the Psalms; if the origin of things, thou hast Genesis; if laws and statutes, thou hast the
glorious law of the Lord God. Do thou therefore utterly abstain from all strange and
diabolical books. Nay, when thou readest the law, think not thyself bound to observe the
additional precepts; though not all of them, yet some of them. Read those barely for the sake
of history, in order to the knowledge of them, and to glorify God that He has delivered thee
from such great and so many bonds. Propose to thyself to distinguish what rules were from
the law of nature, and what were added afterwards, or were such additional rules as were
introduced and given in the wilderness to the Israelites after the making of the calf; for the
law contains those precepts which were spoken by the Lord God before the people fell into
idolatry, and made a calf like the Egyptian Apis—that is, the ten commandments. But as to
those bonds which were further laid upon them after they had sinned, do not thou draw
them upon thyself: for our Saviour came for no other reason but that He might deliver those
that were obnoxious thereto from the wrath which was reserved far them, that438 He might
fulfil the Law and the Prophets, and that He might abrogate or change those secondary
bonds which were superadded to the rest of the law. For therefore did He call to us and say,
“Come unto me,439 all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”440 When,
therefore, thou hast read the Law, which is agreeable to the Gospel and to the Prophets, read
also the books of the Kings, that thou mayest thereby learn which of the kings were righteous,
and how they were prospered by God, and how the promise of eternal life continued with
them from Him; but those kings which went a-whoring from God did soon perish in their
apostasy by the righteous judgment of God, and were deprived of His life, inheriting, instead
of rest, eternal punishment. Wherefore by reading these books thou wilt be mightily
strengthened in the faith, and edified in Christ, whose body and member thou art. Moreover,
when thou walkest abroad in public, and hast a mind to bathe, make use of that bath which
is appropriated to men, lest, by discovering thy body in an unseemly manner to women, or
by seeing a sight not seemly for men, either thou beest ensnared, or thou ensnarest and enticest
to thyself those women who easily yield to such temptations.441 Take care, therefore,

my words, and hide my commandments with thee. Say unto Wisdom, Thou art my sister;
and make understanding familiar with thee: that she may keep thee from the strange and
wicked woman, in case such a one accost thee with sweet words. For from the window of
her house she looks into the street, to see if she can espy some young man among the foolish
children, without understanding, walking in the market-place, in the meeting of the street
near her house, and talking in the dusk of the evening, or in the silence and darkness of the
night. A woman meets him in the appearance of an harlot, who steals away the hearts of
young persons. She rambles about, and is dissolute; her feet abide not in her house: sometimes
she is without, sometimes in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner. Then she catches
him, and kisses him, and with an impudent face says unto him, I have peace-offerings with
me; this day do I pay my vows: therefore came I forth to meet thee; earnestly I have desired
thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my bed with coverings; with tapestry from
Egypt have I adorned it. I have perfumed my bed with saffron, and my house with cinnamon.
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; come, let us solace ourselves with love,”
etc. To which he adds: “With much discourse she seduced him, with snares from her lips
she forced him. He goes after her like a silly bird.”442 And again: “Do not hearken to a wicked
woman; for though the lips of an harlot are like drops from an honey-comb, which for a
while is smooth in thy throat, yet afterwards thou wilt find her more bitter than gall, and
sharper than any two-edged sword.”443 And again: “But get away quickly, and tarry not; fix
not thine eyes upon her: for she hath thrown down many wounded; yea, innumerable
multitudes have been slain by her.”444 “If not,” says he, “yet thou wilt repent at the last,
when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, and wilt say, How have I hated instruction, and
my heart has avoided the reproofs of the righteous! I have not hearkened to the voice of my
instructor, nor inclined mine ear to my teacher. I have almost been in all evil.”445 But we
will make no more quotations; and if we have omitted any, be so prudent as to select the
most valuable out of the Holy Scriptures, and confirm yourselves with them, rejecting all
things that are evil, that so you may be found holy with God in eternal life.</p>

precious than costly stones. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that she
shall have no need of spoil: for she does good to her husband all the days of her life. She
buyeth wool and flax, and worketh profitable things with her hands. She is like the merchants’
ships, she bringeth her food from far. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat
to her household, and food to her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with the
fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and
strengtheneth her arms. She tasteth that it is good to labour; her lamp goeth not out all the
whole night. She stretcheth out her arms for useful work, and layeth her hands to the spindle.
She openeth her hands to the needy; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the poor. Her
husband takes no care of the affairs of his house; for all that are with her are clothed with
double garments. She maketh coats for her husband, clothings of silk and purple. Her husband
is eminent in the gates, when he sitteth with the elders of the land. She maketh fine
linen, and selleth it to the Phoenicians, and girdles to the Canaanites. She is clothed with
glory and beauty, and she rejoices in the last days. She openeth her mouth with wisdom and
discretion, and puts her words in order. The ways of her household are strict; she eateth not

tongue are the laws of mercy. Her children arise up and praise her for her riches, and her
husband joins in her praises. Many daughters have obtained wealth and done worthily, but
thou surpassest and excellest them all. May lying flatteries and the vain beauty of a wife be

God. If thou desirest to be one of the faithful, and to please the Lord, O wife, do not superadd
ornaments to thy beauty, in order to please other men; neither affect to wear fine broidering,
garments, or shoes, to entice those who are allured by such things. For although thou dost
not these wicked things with design of sinning thyself, but only for the sake of ornament
and beauty, yet wilt thou not so escape future punishment, as having compelled another to
look so hard at thee as to lust after thee, and as not having taken care both to avoid sin thyself,
and the affording scandal to others. But if thou yield thyself up, and commit the crime, thou
art both guilty of thy own sin, and the cause of the ruin of the other’s soul also. Besides,
when thou hast committed lewdness with one man, and beginnest to despair, thou wilt
again turn away from thy duty, and follow others, and grow past feeling; as says the divine
word: “When a wicked man comes into the depth of evil, he becomes a scorner, and then
disgrace and reproach come upon him.”452 For such a woman afterward being wounded,
ensnares without restraint the souls of the foolish. Let us learn, therefore, how the divine
word triumphs over such women, saying: “I hated a woman who is a snare and net to the
heart of men worse than death; her hands are fetters.”453 And in another passage: “As a
jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is beauty in a wicked woman.”454 And again: “As a worm
in wood, so does a wicked woman destroy her husband.”455 And again: “It is better to dwell
in the corner of the house-top, than with a contentious and an angry woman.”456 You,
therefore, who are Christian women, do not imitate such as these. But thou who designest
to be faithful to thine own husband, take care to please him alone. And when thou art in
the streets, cover thy head; for by such a covering thou wilt avoid being viewed of idle persons.
Do not paint thy face, which is God’s workmanship; for there is no part of thee which wants
ornament, inasmuch as all things which God has made are very good. But the lascivious
additional adorning of what is already good is an affront to the bounty of the Creator. Look
downward when thou walkest abroad, veiling thyself as becomes women.</p>

<head>THAT A WOMAN MUST NOT BATHE WITH MEN.</head>
<p>IX. Avoid also that disorderly practice of bathing in the same place with men; for many
are the nets of the evil one. And let not a Christian woman bathe with an hermaphrodite;
for if she is to veil her face, and conceal it with modesty from strange men, how can she bear
to enter naked into the bath together with men? But if the bath be appropriated to women,
let her bathe orderly, modestly, and moderately. But let her not bathe without occasion, nor
much, nor often, nor in the middle of the day, nor, if possible, every day; and let the tenth
hour of the day be the set time for such seasonable bathing. For it is convenient that thou,
who art a Christian woman, shouldst ever constantly avoid a curiosity which has many eyes.</p>

or of blaspheming God, and thou be partaker of a woe from God. For, says He, “Woe to
him by whom My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles;”457 and lest, if thy husband be
a Christian, he be forced, from his knowledge of the Scriptures, to say that which is written
in the book of Wisdom: “It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and
an angry woman.”458 You wives, therefore, demonstrate your piety by your modesty and
meekness to all without the Church, whether they be women or men, in order to their conversion
and improvement in the faith. And since we have warned you, and instructed you
briefly, whom we do esteem our sisters, daughters, and members, as being wise yourselves,

<head>THAT A BISHOP MUST BE WELL INSTRUCTED AND EXPERIENCED IN THE
WORD.</head>
<p>I. But concerning bishops, we have heard from our Lord, that a pastor who is to be ordained
a bishop for the churches in every parish, must be unblameable, unreprovable, free
from all kinds of wickedness common among men, not under fifty years of age; for such a
one is in good part past youthful disorders, and the slanders of the heathen, as well as the
reproaches which are sometimes cast upon many persons by some false brethren, who do
not consider the word of God in the Gospel: “Whosoever speaketh an idle word shall give
an account thereof to the Lord in the day of judgment.”459 And again: “By thy words thou
shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”460 Let him therefore, if it is
possible, be well educated; but if he be unlettered, let him at any rate be461 skilful in the word,
and of competent age. But if in a small parish one advanced in years is not to be found,462
let some younger person, who has a good report among his neighbours, and is esteemed by
them worthy of the office of a bishop,—who has carried himself from his youth with
meekness and regularity, like a much elder person,—after examination, and a general good
report, be ordained in peace. For Solomon at twelve years of age was king of Israel,463 and
Josiah at eight years of age reigned righteously,464 and in like manner Joash governed the
people at seven years of age.465 Wherefore, although the person be young, let him be meek,
gentle, and quiet. For the Lord God says by Esaias: “Upon whom will I look, but upon him
who is humble and quiet, and always trembles at my words?”466 In like manner it is in the
Gospel also: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”467 Let him also be
merciful; for again it is said: “Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.”468 Let
him also be a peacemaker; for again it is said: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be

but gentle; not a brawler, not covetous; “not a novice, lest, being puffed up with pride, he
fall into condemnation, and the snare of the devil: for every one that exalteth himself shall
be abased.”471 Such a one a bishop ought to be, who has been the “husband of one wife,”472
who also has herself had no other husband, “ruling well his own house.”473 In this manner
let examination be made when he is to receive ordination, and to be placed in his bishopric,
whether he be grave, faithful, decent; whether he hath a grave and faithful wife, or has
formerly had such a one; whether he hath educated his children piously, and has “brought
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;”474 whether his domestics do fear and
reverence him, and are all obedient to him: for if those who are immediately about him for
worldly concerns are seditious and disobedient, how will others not of his family, when they
are under his management, become obedient to him?</p>

<p>On which account let him also be void of anger; for Wisdom says: “Anger destroys even
the prudent.”476 Let him also be merciful, of a generous and loving temper; for our Lord
says: “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another.”477 Let him
be also ready to give, a lover of the widow and the stranger; ready to serve, and minister,
and attend; resolute in his duty; and let him know who is the most worthy of his assistance.</p>

BUT THAT SOMETIMES A WOMAN WHO HAS A HUSBAND IS TO BE PREFERRED:

TO GLUTTONY, DRUNKENNESS, AND IDLENESS.</p>
<p>IV. For if there be a widow who is able to support herself, and another woman who is
not a widow, but is needy by reason of sickness, or the bringing up many children, or infirmity
of her hands, let him stretch out his hand in charity rather to this latter. But if any one
be in want by gluttony, drunkenness, or idleness, he does not deserve any assistance, or to
be esteemed a member of the Church of God. For the Scripture, speaking of such persons,
says: “The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom, and is not able to bring it to his mouth
again.”478 And again: “The sluggard folds up his hands, and eats his own flesh.”479 “For
every drunkard and whoremonger shall come to poverty, and every drowsy person shall be
clothed with tatters and rags.”480 And in another passage: “If thou give thine eyes to drinking
and cups, thou shalt afterwards walk more naked than a pestle.”481 For certainly idleness is
the mother of famine.</p>

his cause: for the judgment is the Lord’s.”482 And again: “Thou shalt with exact justice follow
that which is right.”483 Let a bishop be frugal, and contented with a little in his meat and
drink, that he may be ever in a sober frame, and disposed to instruct and admonish the ignorant;
and let him not be costly in his diet, a pamperer of himself, given to pleasure, or
fond of delicacies. Let him he patient and gentle in his admonitions, well instructed himself,
meditating in and diligently studying the Lord’s books, and reading them frequently, that
so he may be able carefully to interpret the Scriptures, expounding the Gospel in correspondence
with the prophets and with the law; and let the expositions from the law and the
prophets correspond to the Gospel. For the Lord Jesus says: “Search the Scriptures; for they
are those which testify of me.”484 And again: “For Moses wrote of me.”485 But, above all,
let him carefully distinguish between the original law and the additional precepts, and show
which are the laws for believers, and which the bonds for the unbelievers, lest any should
fall under those bonds. Be careful, therefore, O bishop, to study the word, that thou mayest
be able to explain everything exactly, and that thou mayest copiously nourish thy people
with much doctrine, and enlighten them with the light of the law; for God says: “Enlighten
yourselves with the light of knowledge, while we have yet opportunity.”486</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">    
<p>THAT A BISHOP MUST NOT BE GIVEN TO FILTHY LUCRE, NOR BE A SURETY
NOR AN ADVOCATE.</p>
<p>VI. Let not a bishop be given to filthy lucre, especially before the Gentiles, rather suffering
than offering injuries; not covetous, nor rapacious; no purloiner; no admirer of the rich,
nor hater of the poor; no evil-speaker, nor false witness; not given to anger; no brawler; not
entangled with the affairs of this life; not a surety for any one, nor an accuser in suits about
money; not ambitious; not double-minded, nor double-tongued; not ready to hearken to
calumny or evil-speaking; not a dissembler; not addicted to the heathen festivals; not given
to vain deceits; not eager after worldly things, nor a lover of money. For all these things are
opposite to God, and pleasing to demons. Let the bishop earnestly give all these precepts in
charge to the laity also, persuading them to imitate his conduct. For, says He, “Do ye make
the children of Israel pious.”487 Let him be prudent, humble, apt to admonish with the instructions
of the Lord, well-disposed, one who has renounced all the wicked projects of this
world, and all heathenish lusts; let hint be orderly, sharp in observing the wicked, and taking

heed of them, but yet a friend to all; just, discerning; and whatsoever qualities are commendable
among men, let the bishop possess them in himself. For if the pastor be unblameable
as to any wickedness, he will compel his own disciples, and by his very mode of life press
them to become worthy imitators of his own actions. As the prophet somewhere says, “And
it will be, as is the priest, so is the people;”488 for our Lord and Teacher Jesus Christ, the
Son489 of God, began first to do, and then to teach, as Luke somewhere says:490 “which Jesus
began to do and to teach.”491 Wherefore he says: “Whosoever shall do and teach, he shall
be called great in the kingdom of God.”492 For you bishops are to be guides and watchmen
to the people, as you yourselves have Christ for your guide and watchman. Do you therefore
become good guides and watchmen to the people of God. For the Lord says by Ezekiel,
speaking to every one of you: “Son of man, I have given thee for a watchman to the house
of Israel; and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt observe, and shalt declare
it from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to
warn the wicked from his wickedness, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and his
blood will I require at thine hand. But if thou warn the wicked from his way, that he may
turn from it, and he does not turn from it, he shall die in his iniquity, and thou hast delivered
thy soul.”493 “In the same manner, if the sword of war be approaching, and the people set
a watchman to watch, and he see the same approach, and does not forewarn them, and the
sword come and take one of them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood shall be
required at the watchman’s hand, because he did not blow the trumpet. But if he blew the
trumpet, and he who heard it would not take warning, and the sword come and take him
away, his blood shall be upon him, because he heard the trumpet and took not warning. But
he who took warning has delivered his soul; and the watchman, because he gave warning,
shall surely live.”494 The sword here is the judgment; the trumpet is the holy Gospel; the
watchman is the bishop, who is set in the Church, who is obliged by his preaching to testify
and vehemently to forewarn495 concerning that judgment. If ye do not declare and testify
this to the people, the sins of those who are ignorant of it will be found upon you. Wherefore
do you warn and reprove the uninstructed with boldness, teach the ignorant, confirm those
that understand, bring back those that go astray. If we repeat the very same things on the

that some will be made ashamed, and at least do some good action, and avoid some wicked
one. For says God by the prophet: “Testify those things to them; perhaps they will hear thy
voice.”496 And again: “If perhaps they will hear, if perhaps they will submit.”497 Moses also
says to the people: “If hearing thou wilt hear the Lord God, and do that which is good and
right in His eyes.”498 And again:499 “Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.”500 And
our Lord is often recorded in the Gospel to have said: “He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.”501 And wise Solomon says: “My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and reject not
the laws of thy mother.”502 And, indeed, to this day men have not heard; for while they
seem to have heard, they have not heard aright, as appears by their having left the one and
only true God, and their being drawn into destructive and dangerous heresies, concerning
which we shall speak again afterwards.</p>

any longer, so those who are dead with Christ cannot practice wickedness. We do not

<head>CONCERNING A PERSON FALSELY ACCUSED, OR A PERSON CONVICTED.</head>
<p>VIII. But if any one be maliciously prosecuted by the heathen, because he will not still
go along with them to the same excess of riot, let him know that such a one is blessed of
God, according as our Lord says in the Gospel: “Blessed are ye when men shall reproach
you, or persecute you, or say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and
be exceeding glad, for your reward is great in heaven.”503 If, therefore, any one be slandered
and falsely accused, such a one is blessed; for the Scripture says, “A man that is a reprobate
is not tried by God.”504 But if any one be convicted as having done a wicked action, such a
one not only hurts himself, but occasions the whole body of the Church and its doctrine to
be blasphemed; as if we Christians did not practice those things that we declare to be good
and honest, and we ourselves shall be reproached by the Lord, that “they say and do not.”505

<head>THAT A BISHOP WHO BY WRONG JUDGMENT SPARES AN OFFENDER IS
HIMSELF GUILTY.</head>
<p>X. But he who does not consider these things, will, contrary to justice, spare him who
deserves punishment; as Saul spared Agag,511 and Eli512 his sons, “who knew not the Lord.”
Such a one profanes his own dignity, and that Church of God which is in his parish. Such
a one is esteemed unjust before God and holy men, as affording occasion of scandal to many
of the newly baptized, and to the catechumens; as also to the youth of both sexes, to whom
a woe belongs, add “a mill-stone about his neck,”513 and drowning, on account of his guilt.
For, observing what a person their governor is, through his wickedness and neglect of justice
they will grow sceptical, and, indulging the same disease, will be compelled to perish with
him; as was the case of the people joining with Jeroboam,514 and those which were in the
conspiracy with Corah.515 But if the offender sees that the bishop and deacons are innocent
and unblameable, and the flock pure, he will either not venture to despise their authority,
and to enter into the Church of God at all, as one smitten by his own conscience: or if he
values nothing, and ventures to enter in, either he will be convicted immediately, as Uzza516
at the ark, when he touched it to support it; and as Achan,517 when he stole the accursed
thing; and as Gehazi,518 when he coveted the money of Naaman, and so will be immediately
punished: or else he will be admonished by the pastor, and drawn to repentance. For when
he looks round the whole Church one by one, and can spy no blemish, neither in the bishop
nor in the people who are under his care, he will be put to confusion, and pricked at the
heart, and in a peaceable manner will go his way with shame and many tears, and the flock

adorn thy place and dignity, which is that of one sustaining the character of God among
men, as being set over all men, over priests, kings, rulers, fathers, children, teachers, and in
general over all those who are subject to thee: and so sit in the Church when thou speakest,
as having authority to judge offenders. For to you, O bishops, it is said: “Whatsoever ye shall

<head>INSTRUCTION AS TO HOW A BISHOP OUGHT TO BEHAVE HIMSELF TO THE
PENITENT.</head>
<p>XII. Do thou therefore, O bishop, judge with authority like God, yet receive the penitent;
for God is a God of mercy. Rebuke those that sin, admonish those that are not converted,
exhort those that stand to persevere in their goodness, receive the penitent; for the Lord
God has promised with an oath to afford remission to the penitent for what things they
have done amiss. For He says by Ezekiel: “Speak unto them, As I live, saith the Lord, I would
not the death of a sinner, but that the wicked turn from his evil way, and live. Turn ye
therefore front your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”520 Here the word521
affords hope to sinners, that if they will repent they shall have hope of salvation, lest otherwise
out of despair they yield themselves up to their transgressions; but that, having hope of salvation,
they may he converted, and may address to God with tears, on account of their sins,
and may repent from their hearts, and so appease His displeasure towards them; so shall
they receive a pardon from Him, as from a merciful Father.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<head>THAT WE OUGHT TO BEWARE HOW WE MAKE TRIAL OF ANY SINFUL COURSE.</head>
<p>XIII. Yet it is very necessary that those who are yet innocent should continue so, and
not make an experiment what sin is, that they may not have occasion for trouble, sorrow,
and those lamentations which are in order to forgiveness. For how dost thou know, O man,
when thou sinnest, whether thou shalt live any number of days in this present state, that
thou mayest have time to repent? For the time of thy departure out of this world is uncertain;

and if thou diest in sin, there will remain no repentance for thee; as God says by David, “In
the grave who will confess to Thee?”522 It behoves us, therefore, to be ready in the doing of
our duty, that so we may await our passage into another world without sorrow. Wherefore
also the Divine Word exhorts, speaking to thee by the wise Solomon,523 “Prepare thy works
against thy exit, and provide all beforehand in the field,”524 lest some of the things necessary
to thy journey be wanting; as the oil of piety was deficient in the five foolish virgins525
mentioned in the Gospel, when they, on account of their having extinguished their lamps
of divine knowledge, were shut out of the bride-chamber. Wherefore he who values the security
of his soul will take care to be out of danger, by keeping free from sin, that so he may
preserve the advantage of his former good works to himself. Do thou, therefore, so judge
as executing judgment for God. For, as the Scripture says, “the judgment is the Lord’s.”526
In the first place, therefore, condemn the guilty person with authority; afterwards try to
bring him home with mercy and compassion, and readiness to receive him, promising him
salvation if he will change his course of life, and become a penitent; and when he does repent,
and has submitted to his chastisement, receive him: remembering that our Lord has said,
“There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.”527</p>

in their purpose.529 Turn, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.”530
Receive, therefore, without any doubting, him that repents. Be not hindered by such unmerciful
men, who say that we must not be defiled with such as those, nor so much as speak to
them: for such advice is from men that are unacquainted with God and His providence, and
are unreasonable judges, and unmerciful brutes. These men are ignorant that we ought to
avoid society with offenders, not in discourse, but in actions: for “the righteousness of the
righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.”531 And
again: “If a land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out my hand
upon it, and break the staff of bread upon it, and send famine upon it, and destroy man and
beast therein: though these three men, Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in the midst of it, they
shall only save their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God.”532 The Scripture
most clearly shows that a righteous man that converses with a wicked man does not perish
with him. For in the present world the righteous and the wicked are mingled together in
the common affairs of life, but not in holy communion: and in this the friends and favourites
of God are guilty of no sin. For they do but imitate “their Farther which is in heaven, who
maketh His sun to rise on the righteous and unrighteous, and sendeth His rain on the evil
and on the good;”533 and the righteous man undergoes no peril on this account. For those
who conquer and those who are conquered are in the same place of running, but only those
who have bravely undergone the race are where the garland is bestowed; and “no one is
crowned, unless he strive lawfully.”534 For every one shall give account of himself, and God
will not destroy the righteous with the wicked; for with Him it is a constant rule, that innocence
is never punished. For neither did He drown Noah, nor burn up Lot, nor destroy
Rahab for company. And if you desire to know how this matter was among us, Judas was
one of us, and took the like part of the ministry which we had; and Simon the magician received
the seal of the Lord. Yet both the one and the other proving wicked, the former
hanged himself, and the latter, as he flew in the air in a manner unnatural, was dashed against
the earth. Moreover, Noah and his sons with him were in the ark; but Ham, who alone was
found wicked, received punishment in his son.535 But if fathers are not punished for their
children, nor children for their fathers, it is thence clear that neither will wives be punished
for their husbands, nor servants for their masters, nor one relation for another, nor one

friend for another, nor the righteous for the wicked. But every one will be required an account
of his own doing. For neither was punishment inflicted on Noah for the world, nor was Lot
destroyed by fire for the Sodomites, nor was Rahab slain for the inhabitants of Jericho, nor
Israel for the Egyptians. For not the dwelling together, but the agreement in their sentiments,
alone could condemn the righteous with the wicked. We ought not therefore to hearken to
such persons who call for death, and hate mankind, and love accusations, and under fair
pretences bring men to death. For one man shall not die for another, but “every one is held
with the chains of his own sins.”536 And, “behold, the man and his work is before his face.”537
Now we ought to assist those who are with us,538 and are in danger, and fall, and, as far as
lies in our power, to reduce them to sobriety by our exhortations, and so save them from
death. For “the whole have no need of the physician, but the sick;”539 since “it is not pleasing
in the sight of your Father that one of these little ones should perish.”540 For we ought not
to establish the will of hard-hearted men, but the will of the God and Father of the universe,
which is revealed to us by Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>For it is not equitable that thou, O bishop, who art the head, shouldst submit to the tail,
that is, to some seditious person among the laity, to the destruction of another, but to God
alone. For it is thy privilege to govern those under thee, but not to be governed by them.
For neither does a son, who is subject by the course of generation, govern his father; nor a
slave, who is subject by law, govern his master; nor does a scholar govern his teacher, nor
a soldier his king, nor any of the laity his bishop. For that there is no reason to suppose that
such as converse with the wicked, in order to their instruction in the word, are defiled by
or partake of their sins, Ezekiel, as it were on purpose preventing the suspicions of ill-disposed
persons, says thus: “Why do you speak this proverb concerning the land of Israel? The
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge. As I live, saith the
Lord God, ye shall not henceforth have occasion to use this proverb in Israel. For all souls
are mine, in like manner as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul
that sinneth, it shall die. But the man who is righteous, and does judgment and justice” (and
so the prophet reckons up the rest of the virtues, and then adds for a conclusion, “Such a
one is just”), “he shall surely live, saith the Lord God. And if he beget a son who is a robber,
a shedder of blood, and walks not in the way of his righteous father” (and when the prophet
had added what follows, he adds in the conclusion), “he shall certainly not live: he has done
all this wickedness; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. Yet they will ask thee,

Why? Does not the son bear the iniquity of the father; or his righteousness, having exercised
righteousness and mercy himself? And thou shalt say unto them, The soul that sinneth, it
shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the
iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall be upon him.”541 And a little after he says: “When the righteous turneth
away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, all his righteousness, by reason of
all his wickedness which he has committed, shall not be mentioned to him: in his iniquity
which he hath committed, and in his sin which he hath sinned, in them shall he die.” And
a little after he adds: “When the wicked turneth away from his wickedness which he hath
committed, and doth judgment and justice, he hath preserved his soul, he hath turned away
from all his ungodliness which he hath done; he shall surely live, he shall not die.” And afterwards:
“I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the
Lord God.”</p>

<head>THAT A PRIEST MUST NEITHER OVERLOOK OFFENCES, NOR BE RASH IN
PUNISHING THEM.</head>
<p>XV. Observe, you who are our beloved sons, how merciful yet righteous the Lord our
God is; how gracious and kind to men; and yet most certainly “He will not acquit the
guilty:”542 though He welcomes the returning sinner, and revives him, leaving no room for
suspicion to such as wish to judge sternly and to reject offenders entirely, and to refuse to
vouchsafe to them exhortations which might bring them to repentance. In contradiction to
such, God by Isaiah says to the bishops: “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ye priests: speak
comfortably to Jerusalem.” It therefore behoves you, upon hearing those words of His, to
encourage those who have offended, and lead them to repentance, and afford them hope,
and not vainly to suppose that you shall be partakers of their offences on account of such
your love to them. Receive the penitent with alacrity, and rejoice over them, and with mercy
and bowels of compassion judge the sinners. For if a person was walking by the side of a
river, and ready to stumble, and thou shouldest push him and thrust him into the river, instead
of offering him thy hand for his assistance, thou wouldst be guilty of the murder of
thy brother; whereas thou oughtest rather to lend thy helping hand as he was ready to fall,
lest he perish without remedy, that both the people may take warning, and the offender may
not utterly perish. It is thy duty, O bishop, neither to overlook the sins of the people, nor to
reject those who are penitent, that thou mayst not unskilfully destroy the Lord’s flock, or
dishonour His new name, which is imposed on His people, and thou thyself beest reproached
as those ancient pastors were, of whom God speaks thus to Jeremiah: “Many shepherds have
<note type="footnote">541 Ezek. xviii. 2, etc.</note>

destroyed my vineyard; they have polluted my heritage.”543 And in another passage: “My
anger is waxed hot against the shepherds, and against the lambs shall I have indignation.”544
And elsewhere: “Ye are the priests that dishonour my name.”545</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<head>OF REPENTANCE, THE MANNER OF IT, AND RULES ABOUT IT.</head>
<p>XVI. When thou seest the offender, with severity command him to be cast out; and as
he is going out, let the deacons also treat him with severity, and then let them go and seek
for him, and detain him out of the Church; and when they come in, let them entreat thee
for him. For our Saviour Himself entreated His Father for those who had sinned, as it is
written in the Gospel: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”546 Then order
the offender to come in; and if upon examination thou findest that he is penitent, and fit to
be received at all into the Church when thou hast afflicted him his days of fasting, according
to the degree of his offence—as two, three, five, or seven weeks—so set him at liberty, and
speak such things to him as are fit to be said in way of reproof, instruction, and exhortation
to a sinner for his reformation, that so he may continue privately in his humility, and pray
to God to be merciful to him, saying: “If Thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord,
who should stand? For with Thee there is propitiation.”547 Of this sort of declaration is that
which is said in the book of Genesis to Cain: “Thou hast sinned; be quiet;”548 that is, do not
go on in sin. For that a sinner ought to be ashamed for his own sin, that oracle of God delivered
to Moses concerning Miriam is a sufficient proof, when he prayed that she might
be forgiven. For says God to him: “If her father had spit in her face, should she not be
ashamed? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterwards let her come in
again.”549 We therefore ought to do so with offenders, when they profess their repentance,—
namely, to separate them some determinate time, according to the proportion of
their offence, and afterwards, like fathers to children, receive them again upon their repentance.</p>

<head>THAT A BISHOP MUST BE UNBLAMEABLE, AND A PATTERN FOR THOSE WHO
ARE UNDER HIS CHARGE.</head>
<p>XVII. But if the bishop himself be an offender, how will he be able any longer to prosecute
the offence of another? Or how will he be able to reprove another, either he or his deacons,
if by accepting of persons, or receiving of bribes, they have not all a clear conscience? For
when the ruler asks, and the judge receives, judgment is not brought to perfection; but when
both are “companions of thieves, and regardless of doing justice to the widows,”550 those
who are under the bishop will not be able to support and vindicate him: for they will say to
him what is written in the Gospel, “Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s
eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?”551 Let the bishop, therefore,
with his deacons, dread to bear any such thing; that is, let him give no occasion for it. For
an offender, when he sees any other doing as bad as himself, will be encouraged to do the
very same things; and then the wicked one, taking occasion from a single instance, works
in others, which God forbid: and by that means the flock will be destroyed. For the greater
number of offenders there are, the greater is the mischief that is done by them: for sin which
passes without correction grows worse and worse, and spreads to others; since “a little leaven
infects the whole lump,”552 and one thief spreads the abomination over a whole nation and
“dead flies spoil the whole pot of sweet ointment;”553 and “when a king hearkens to unrighteous
counsel, all the servants under him are wicked.”554 So one scabbed sheep, if not separated
from those that are whole, infects the rest with the same distemper; and a man infected
with the plague is to be avoided by all men; and a mad dog is dangerous to every one that
he touches. If, therefore, we neglect to separate the transgressor from the Church of God,
we shall make the “Lord’s house a den of thieves.”555 For it is the bishop’s duty not to be
silent in the case of offenders, but to rebuke them, to exhort them, to beat them down, to
afflict them with fastings, that so he may strike a pious dread into the rest: for, as He says,
“make ye the children of Israel pious.”556 For the bishop must be one who discourages sin
by his exhortations, and sets a pattern of righteousness, and proclaims those good things
which are prepared by God, and declares that wrath which will come at the day of judgment,
lest he contemn and neglect the plantation of God; and, on account of his carelessness, hear

fruit thereof?”557</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<head>THAT A BISHOP MUST TAKE CARE THAT HIS PEOPLE DO NOT SIN,
CONSIDERING THAT HE IS SET FOR A WATCHMAN AMONG THEM.</head>
<p>XVIII. Let the bishop, therefore, extend his concern to all sorts of people: to those who
have not offended, that they may continue innocent; to those who offend, that they may
repent. For to you does the Lord speak thus: “Take heed that ye offend not one of these little
ones.”558 It is your duty also to give remission to the penitent. For as soon as ever one who
has offended says, in the sincerity of his soul, “I have sinned against the Lord,” the Holy
Spirit answers, “The Lord also hath forgiven thy sin; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die.”559
Be sensible, therefore, O bishop, of the dignity of thy place, that as thou hast received the
power of binding, so hast thou also that of loosing. Having therefore the power of loosing,
know thyself, and behave thyself in this world as becomes thy place, being aware that thou
hast a great account to give. “For to whom,” as the Scripture says, “men have entrusted
much, of him they will require the more.”560 For no one man is free from sin, excepting
Him that was made man for us; since it is written: “No man is pure from filthiness; no, not
though he be but one day old.”561 Upon which account the lives and conduct of the ancient
holy men and patriarchs are described; not that we may reproach them from our reading,
but that we ourselves may repent, and have hope that we also shall obtain forgiveness. For
their blemishes are to us both security and admonition, because we hence learn, when we
have offended, that if we repent we shall have pardon. For it is written: “Who can boast that
he has a clean heart? and who dare affirm that he is pure from sin?”562 No man, therefore,
is without sin. Do thou therefore labour to the utmost of thy power to be unblameable; and
be solicitous of all the parts of thy flock, lest any one be scandalized on thy account, and
thereby perish. For the layman is solicitous only for himself, but thou for all, as having a
greater burden, and carrying a heavier load. For it is written: “And the Lord said unto Moses,
Thou and Aaron shall bear the sins of the priesthood.”563 Since, therefore, thou art to give
an account of all, take care of all. Preserve those that are sound, admonish those that sin;
and when thou hast afflicted them with fasting, give them ease by remission; and when with

tears the offender begs readmission, receive him, and let the whole Church pray for him;
and when by imposition of thy hand thou hast admitted him, give him leave to abide afterwards
in the flock. But for the drowsy and the careless, do thou endeavour to convert and
confirm, and warn and cure them, as sensible how great a reward thou shalt have for doing
so, and how great danger thou wilt incur if thou beest negligent therein. For Ezekiel speaks
thus to those overseers who take no care of the people: “Woe unto the shepherds of Israel,
for they have fed themselves; the shepherds feed not the sheep, but themselves. Ye eat the
milk, and are clothed with the wool; ye slay the strong, ye do not feed the sheep. The weak
have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound
up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither
have ye sought that which was lost; but, violently ye chastised them with insult: and they
were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of
the forest.” And again: “The shepherds did not search for my sheep; and the shepherds fed
themselves, but they fed not my sheep.” And a little after: “Behold, I am against the shepherds,
and I will require my sheep at their hands, and cause them to cease from feeding my sheep,
neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep out of
their hands, and they shall not be meat for them.” And he also adds, speaking to the people:
“Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep, and between rams and rams. Seemed it a
small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, and to have trodden down with
your feet the residue of your pasture, and that the sheep have eaten what was trodden down
with your feet? “And a little after He adds: “And ye shall know that I am the Lord, and you
the sheep of my pasture; ye are my men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.”564</p>

between ram and ram, and between sheep and sheep.” And He says to the shepherds: “Ye
shall be judged for your unskilfulness, and for destroying the sheep.” That is, I will judge
between one bishop and another, and between one lay person and another, and between
one ruler and another (for these sheep and these rams are not irrational, but rational
creatures): lest at any time a lay person should say, I am a sheep and not a shepherd, and I
am not concerned for myself; let the shepherd look to that, for he alone will be required to
give an account for me. For as that sheep that will not follow its good shepherd is exposed
to the wolves, to its destruction; so that which follows a bad shepherd is also exposed to

<head>HOW THE GOVERNED ARE TO OBEY THE BISHOPS WHO ARE SET OVER THEM.</head>
<p>XX. As to a good shepherd, let the lay person honour him, love him, reverence him as
his lord, as his master, as the high priest of God, as a teacher of piety. For he that heareth
him, heareth Christ; and he that rejecteth him, rejecteth Christ; and he who does not receive
Christ, does not receive His God and Father: for, says He, “He that heareth you, heareth
me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me, rejecteth Him that
sent me.”565 In like manner, let the bishop love the laity as his children, fostering and
cherishing them with affectionate diligence; as eggs, in order to the hatching of young ones;
or as young ones, taking them in his arms, to the rearing them into birds: admonishing all
men; reproving all who stand in need of reproof; reproving, that is, but not striking; beating
them down to make them ashamed, but not overthrowing them; warning them in order to
their conversion: chiding them in order to their reformation and better course of life;
watching the strong, that is, keeping him firm in the faith who is already strong; feeding the
people peaceably; strengthening the weak, that is, confirming with exhortation that which
is tempted; healing that which is sick, that is, curing by instruction that which is weak in
the faith through doubtfulness of mind; binding up that which is broken, that is, binding
up by comfortable admonitions that which is gone astray, or wounded, bruised, or broken
by their sins, and put out of the way; leasing it of its offences, and giving hope: by this means
restore it in strength to the Church, bringing it back into the flock. Bring again that which
is driven away, that is, do not permit that which is in its sins, and is cast out by way of punishment,
to continue excluded; but receiving it, and bringing it back, restore it to the flock,
that is, to the people of the undefiled Church. Seek for that which is lost, that is, do not
suffer that which desponds of its salvation, by reason of the multitude of its offences, utterly
to perish. Do thou search for that which is grown sleepy, drowsy, and sluggish, and that
which is unmindful of its own life, through the depth of its sleep, and which is at a great
distance from its own flock, so as to be in danger of falling among the wolves, and being
devoured by them. Bring it back by admonition, exhort it to be watchful; and insinuate
hope, not permitting it to say that which was said by some: “Our impieties are upon us, and
we pine away in them; how shall we then live?”566 As far as possible, therefore, let the bishop
make the offence his own, and say to the sinner, Do thou but return, and I will undertake
to suffer death for thee, as our Lord suffered death for me, and for all men. For “the good
shepherd lays down his life for the sheep; but he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd,

whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, that is, the devil, and he leaveth the
sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf seizes upon them.”567 We must know, therefore, that God
is very merciful to those who have offended, and hath promised repentance with an oath.
But he who has offended, and is unacquainted with this promise of God concerning repentance,
and does not understand His long-suffering and forbearance, and besides is ignorant
of the Holy Scriptures, which proclaim repentance, inasmuch as he has never learned them
from you, perishes through his folly. But do thou, like a compassionate shepherd, and a diligent
feeder of the flock, search out, and keep an account of thy flock. Seek that which is
wanting;568 as the Lord God our gracious Father has sent His own Son, the good Shepherd
and Saviour, our Master Jesus, and has commanded Him to “leave the ninety-nine upon
the mountains, and to go in search after that which was lost, and when He had found it, to
take it upon His shoulders, and to carry it into the flock, rejoicing that He had found that
which was lost.”569 In like manner, be obedient, O bishop, and do thou seek that which was
lost, guide that which has wandered out of the right way, bring back that which is gone
astray: for thou hast authority to bring them back, and to deliver those that are brokenhearted
by remission. For by thee does our Saviour say to him who is discouraged under
the sense of his sins, “Thy sins are forgiven thee: thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.”570
But this peace and haven of tranquillity is the Church of Christ, into which do thou, when
thou hast loosed them from their sins, restore them, as being now sound and unblameable,
of good hope, diligent, laborious in good works. As a skilful and compassionate physician,
heal all such as have wandered in the ways of sin; for “they that are whole have no need of
a physician, but they that are sick. For the Son of man came to save and to seek that which
was lost.”571 Since thou art therefore a physician of the Lord’s Church, provide remedies
suitable to every patient’s case. Cure them, heal them by all means possible; restore them
sound to the Church. Feed the flock, “not with insolence and contempt, as lording it over
them,”572 but as a gentle shepherd, “gathering the lambs into thy bosom, and gently leading
those which are with young.”573</p>

<head>THAT IT IS A DANGEROUS THING TO JUDGE WITHOUT HEARING BOTH SIDES,
OR TO DETERMINE OF PUNISHMENT AGAINST A PERSON BEFORE HE IS
CONVICTED.</head>
<p>XXI. Be gentle, gracious, mild, without guile, without falsehood; not rigid, not insolent,
not severe, not arrogant, not unmerciful, not puffed up, not a man-pleaser, not timorous,
not double-minded, not one that insults over the people that are under thee, not one that
conceals the divine laws and the promises to repentance, not hasty in thrusting out and expelling,
but steady, not one that delights in severity, not heady. Do not admit less evidence
to convict any one than that of three witnesses, and those of known and established reputation;
inquire whether they do not accuse out of ill-will or envy: for there are many that delight
in mischief, forward in discourse, slanderous, haters of the brethren, making it their business
to scatter the sheep of Christ; whose affirmation if thou admittest without nice scanning
the same, thou wilt disperse thy flock, and betray it to be devoured by wolves, that is, by
demons and wicked men, or rather not men, but wild beasts in the shape of men—by the
heathen, by the Jews, and by the atheistic heretics. For those destroying wolves soon address
themselves to any one that is cast out of the Church, and esteem him as a lamb delivered
for them to devour, reckoning his destruction their own gain. For he that is “their father,
the devil, is a murderer.”574 He also who is separated unjustly by thy want of care in judging
will be overwhelmed with sorrow, and be disconsolate, and so will either wander over to
the heathen, or be entangled in heresies, and so will be altogether estranged from the Church
and from hope in God, and will be entangled in impiety, whereby thou wilt be guilty of his
perdition: for it is not fair to be too hasty in casting out an offender, but slow in receiving
him when he returns; to be forward in cutting off, but unmerciful when he is sorrowful, and
ought to be healed. For of such as these speaks the divine Scripture: “Their feet run to mis-
chief; they are hasty to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way
of peace have they not known. The fear of God is not before their eyes.”575 Now the way of
peace is our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has taught us, saying: “Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.
Give, and it shall be given to you;”576 that is, give remission of sins, and your offences shall
be forgiven you. As also He instructed us by His prayer to say unto God: “Forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors.”577 If, therefore, you do not forgive offenders, how can
you expect the remission of your own sins? Do not you rather bind yourselves faster, by
pretending in your prayers to forgive, when you really do not forgive? Will you not be
confronted with your own words, when you say you forgive and do not forgive? For know

ye, that he who casts out one who has not behaved himself wickedly, or who will not receive
him that returns, is a murderer of his brother, and sheds his blood, as Cain did that of his
brother Abel, and his “blood cries to God,”578 and will be required. For a righteous man
unjustly slain by any one will be in rest with God for ever. The same is the case of him who
without cause is separated by his bishop. He who has cast him out as a pestilent fellow when
he was innocent, is more furious than a murderer. Such a one has no regard to the mercy
of God, nor is mindful of His goodness to those that are penitent, nor keeping in his eye the
examples of those who, having been once great offenders, received forgiveness upon their
repentance. Upon which account, he who casts off an innocent person is more cruel than
he that murders the body. In like manner, he who does not receive the penitent, scatters the
flock of Christ, being really against Him. For as God is just in judging of sinners, so is He
merciful in receiving them when they return. For David, the man after God’s own heart, in
his hymns ascribes both mercy and judgment to Him.</p>

<head>THAT DAVID, THE NINEVITES, HEZEKIAH, AND HIS SON MANASSEH, ARE
EMINENT EXAMPLES OF REPENTANCE, THE PRAYER OF MANASSEH KING OF
JUDAH.</head>
<p>XXII. It is also thy duty, O bishop, to have before thine eyes the examples of those that
have gone before, and to apply them skilfully to the cases of those who want words of
severity or of consolation. Besides, it is reasonable that in thy administration of justice thou
shouldest follow the will of God; and as God deals with sinners, and with those who return,
that thou shouldest act accordingly in thy judging. Now, did not God by Nathan reproach
David for his offence? And yet as soon as he said he repented, He delivered him from death,
saying, “Be of good cheer; thou shalt not die.”579 So also, when God had caused Jonah580
to be swallowed up by the sea and the whale, upon his refusal to preach to the Ninevites,
when yet he prayed to Him out of the belly of the whale, He retrieved his life from corruption.
And when Hezekiah had been puffed up for a while, yet, as soon as he prayed with lamentation,
He remitted his offence. But, O ye bishops, hearken to an instance useful upon this
occasion. For it is written thus in the fourth book of Kings and the second book of Chronicles:
“And Hezekiah died; and Manasseh his son reigned. He was twelve years old when he began
to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was
Hephzibah. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord: he did not abstain from the abominations
of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from the face of the children of Israel. And
Manasseh returned and built the high places which Hezekiah his father had overthrown;

and he reared pillars for Baal, and set up an altar for Baal, and made groves, as did Ahab
king of Israel. And he made altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord spake to David
and to Solomon his son, saying, Therein will I put my name. And Manasseh set up altars,
and by them served Baal, and said, My name shall continue for ever.581 And he built altars
to the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord; and he made his children
pass through the fire in a place named Ge Benennom;582 and he consulted enchanters, and
dealt with wizards and familiar spirits, and with conjurers and observers of times, and with
teraphim. And he sinned exceedingly in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. And
he set a molten and a graven image, the image of his grove, which he made in the house of
the Lord, wherein the Lord had chosen to put His name in Jerusalem, the holy city, for ever,
and had said, I will no more remove my foot from the land of Israel, which I gave to their
fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
according to all the precepts that my servant Moses commanded them. And they hearkened
not. And Manasseh seduced them to do more evil before the Lord than did the nations
whom the Lord cast out from the face of the children of Israel. And the Lord spake concerning
Manasseh and concerning His people by the hand of His servants the prophets, saying, Be-
cause Manasseh king of Judah has done all these wicked abominations in a higher degree
than the Amorite did which was before him, and hath made Judah to sin with his idols, thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring evils upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
heareth of them, both his ears shall tingle. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of
Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will blot out Jerusalem as a tablebook
is blotted out by wiping it. And I will turn it upside down; and I will give up the remnant
of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies, and they shall become
a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, because of all the evils which they have done
in mine eyes, and have provoked me to anger from the day that I brought their fathers out
of the land of Egypt even until this day. Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very
much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, beside his sins wherewith he
made Judah to sin in doing evil in the sight of the Lord. And the Lord brought upon him
the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they caught Manasseh in bonds, and they
bound him in fetters of brass, and brought him to Babylon; and he was bound and shackled
with iron all over in the house of the prison. And bread made of bran was given unto him
scantily, and by weight, and water mixed with vinegar but a little and by measure, so much
as would keep him alive; and he was in straits and sore affliction. And when he was violently
afflicted, he besought the face of the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the
face of the Lord God of his fathers. And he prayed unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, almighty

God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed, who hast made
heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof, who hast bound the sea by the word of Thy
commandment, who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by Thy terrible and glorious name,
whom all men fear and tremble before Thy power; for the majesty of Thy glory cannot be
borne, and Thine angry threatening towards sinners is insupportable. But Thy merciful
promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; for Thou art the most high Lord,583 of great
compassion, long-suffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord,
according to Thy great goodness, hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that
have sinned against Thee, and of Thine infinite mercy hast appointed repentance unto sinners,
that they may be saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, has not
appointed repentance to the just as to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, which have not sinned
against Thee; but Thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have
sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied;
my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of
heaven for the multitude of mine iniquity. I am bowed down with many iron bands; for I
have provoked Thy wrath, and done evil before Thee, setting up abominations, and multiplying
offences. Now, therefore, I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching Thee of grace.
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities; wherefore I humbly
beseech Thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be
not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower
part of the earth. For Thou art the God, even the God of them that repent, and in me Thou
wilt show Thy goodness; for Thou wilt save me that am unworthy, according to Thy great
mercy. Therefore I will praise Thee for ever all the days of my life; for all the powers of the
heavens do praise Thee, and Thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen. And the Lord heard
his voice, and had compassion upon him. And there appeared a flame of fire about him,
and all the iron shackles and chains which were about him fell off; and the Lord healed
Manasseh from his affliction, and brought him back to Jerusalem unto his kingdom: and
Manasseh knew that the Lord He is God alone. And he worshipped the Lord God alone
with all his heart, and with all his soul, all the days of his life; and he was esteemed righteous.
And he took away the strange gods and the graven image out of the house of the Lord, and
all the altars which he had built in the house of the Lord, and all the altars in Jerusalem, and
he cast them out of the city. And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon
peace-offerings and thank-offerings. And Manasseh spake to Judah to serve the Lord God
of Israel. And he slept in peace with his fathers; and Amon his son reigned in his stead. And
he did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all things that Manasseh his father had done
in the former part of his reign. And he provoked the Lord his God to anger.”584</p>

<p>Ye have heard, our beloved children, how the Lord God for a while punished him that

<p>XXIII. There is no sin more grievous than idolatry, for it is an impiety against God: and
yet even this sin has been forgiven, upon sincere repentance. But if any one sin in direct
opposition, and on purpose to try whether God will punish the wicked or not, such a one
shall have no remission, although he say with himself, “All is well, and I will walk according
to the conversation of my evil heart.” Such a one was Amon the son of Manasseh. For the
Scripture says: “And Amon reasoned an evil reasoning of transgression, and said, My father
from his childhood was a great transgressor, and repented in his old age; and now I will
walk as my soul lusteth, and afterwards I will return unto the Lord. And he did evil in the
sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And the Lord God soon destroyed him
utterly from His good land. And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
own house, and he reigned two years only.”</p>

<head>THAT CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD CAME TO SAVE SINNERS BY REPENTANCE.</head>
<p>XXIV. Take heed, therefore, ye of the laity, lest any one of you fix the reasoning of Amon
in his heart, and be suddenly cut off, and perish. In the same manner, let the bishop take all
the care he can that those which are yet innocent may not fall into sin; and let him heal and
receive those which turn from their sins. But if he is pitiless, and will not receive the repenting
sinner, he will sin against the Lord his God, pretending to be more just than God’s justice,
and not receiving him whom He has received, through Christ; for whose sake He sent His
Son upon earth to men, as a man; for whose sake God was pleased that He, who was the
Maker of man and woman, should be born of a woman; for whose sake He did not spare
Him from the cross, from death, and burial, but permitted Him to die, who by nature could
not suffer, His beloved Son, God the Word, the Angel of His great council, that he might
deliver those from death who were obnoxious to death. Him do those provoke to anger who
do not receive the penitent. For He was not ashamed of me, Matthew, who had been formerly
a publican; and admitted of Peter, when he had through fear denied Him three times, but
had appeased Him by repentance, and had wept bitterly; nay, He made him a shepherd to
His own lambs. Moreover, He ordained Paul, our fellow-apostle, to be of a persecutor an
apostle, and declared him a chosen vessel, even when he had heaped many mischiefs upon
us before, and had blasphemed His sacred name. He says also to another, a woman that was
a sinner: “Thy sins, which are many, are forgiven, for thou lovest much.”585 And when the

Him, and were gone out, our Lord, the Searcher of the hearts, inquiring of her whether the
elders had condemned her, and being answered No, He said unto her: “Go thy way therefore,
for neither do I condemn thee.”586 This Jesus, O ye bishops, our Saviour, our King, and our

to convert, willing to receive and to comfort; no strikers, not soon angry, not injurious, not
arrogant, not supercilious, not wine-bibbers, not drunkards, not vainly expensive, not lovers
of delicacies, not extravagant, using the gifts of God not as another’s, but as their own, as
good stewards appointed over them, as those who will be required by God to give an account

of God, as a man of God; as also let him dispense in a right manner the free-will offerings
which are brought in on account of the poor, to the orphans, the widows, the afflicted,
and strangers in distress, as having that God for the examiner of his accounts who has
committed the disposition to him. Distribute to all those in want with righteousness, and
yourselves use the things which belong to the Lord, but do not abuse them; eating of them,
but not eating them all up by yourselves: communicate with those that are in want, and
thereby show yourselves unblameable before God. For if you shall consume them by
yourselves, you will be reproached by God, who says to such unsatiable people, who alone
devour all, “Ye eat up the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool;”588 and in another
passage, “Must you alone live upon the earth”?589 Upon which account you are commanded
in the law, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”590 Now we say these things, not as if
you might not partake of the fruits of your labours; for it is written, “Thou shalt not muzzle
the mouth of the ox which treadeth out the corn;”591 but that you should do it with moderation
and righteousness. As, therefore, the ox that labours in the threshing-floor without a
muzzle eats indeed, but does not eat all up; so do you who labour in the threshing-floor,
that is, in the Church of God, eat of the Church: which was also the case of the Levites, who
served in the tabernacle of the testimony, which was in all things a type of the Church. Nay,
further, its very name implied that that tabernacle was fore-appointed for a testimony of
the Church. Here, therefore, the Levites also, who attended upon the tabernacle partook of
those things that were offered to God by all the people,—namely, gifts, offerings, and firstfruits,
and tithes, and sacrifices, and oblations, without disturbance, they and their wives,
and their sons and their daughters. Since their employment was the ministration to the

tabernacle, therefore they had not any lot or inheritance in the land among the children of
Israel, because the oblations of the people were the lot of Levi, and the inheritance of their
tribe. You, therefore, O bishops, are to your people priests and Levites, ministering to the
holy tabernacle, the holy Catholic Church; who stand at the altar of the Lord your God, and
offer to Him reasonable and unbloody sacrifices through Jesus the great High Priest. You
are to the laity prophets, rulers, governors, and kings; the mediators between God and His
faithful people, who receive and declare His word, well acquainted with the Scriptures. Ye
are the voice of God, and witnesses of His will, who bear the sins of all, and intercede for
all; whom, as you have heard, the word severely threatens if you hide the key of knowledge
from men, who are liable to perdition if you do not declare His will to the people that are
under you; who shall have a certain reward from God, and unspeakable honour and glory,
if you duly minister to the holy tabernacle. For as yours is the burden, so you receive as your
fruit the supply of food and other necessaries. For you imitate Christ the Lord; and as He
“bare the sins of us all upon the tree” at His crucifixion, the innocent for those who deserved
punishment, so also you ought to make the sins of the people your own. For concerning
our Saviour it is said in Isaiah, “He bears our sins, and is afflicted for us.”592 And again: “He
bare the sins of many, and was delivered for our offences.”593 As, therefore, you are patterns
for others, so have you Christ for your pattern. As, therefore, He is concerned for all, so be
you for the laity under you. For do not thou imagine that the office of a bishop is an easy
or light burden. As, therefore, you bear the weight, so have you a right to partake of the
fruits before others, and to impart to those that are in want, as being to give an account to
Him, who without bias will examine your accounts. For those who attend upon the Church
ought to be maintained by the Church, as being priests, Levites, presidents, and ministers
of God; as it is written in the book of Numbers concerning the priests: “And the Lord said
unto Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy family, shall bear the iniquities of the
holy things of priesthood.”594 “Behold, I have given unto you the charge of the first-fruits,
from all that are sanctified to me by the children of Israel; I have given them for a reward
to thee, and to thy sons after thee, by an ordinance for ever. This shall be yours out of the
holy things, out of the oblations, and out of the gifts, and out of all the sacrifices, and out
of every trespass-offering, and sin-offerings; and all that they render unto me out of all their
holy things, they shall belong to thee, and to thy sons: in the sanctuary shall they eat them.”595
And a little after: “All the first-fruits of the oil, and of the wine, and of the wheat, all which
they shall give unto the Lord, to thee have I given them; and all that is first ripe, to thee have

I given it, and every devoted thing. Every first-born of man and of beast, clean and unclean,
and of sacrifice, with the breast, and the right shoulder, all these appertain to the priests,
and to the rest of those belonging to them, even to the Levites.”596</p>
<p>Hear this, you of the laity also, the elect Church of God. For the people were formerly
called “the people of God,”597 and “an holy nation.”598 You, therefore, are the holy and
sacred “Church of God, enrolled in heaven, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
people,”599 a bride adorned for the Lord God, a great Church, a faithful Church. Hear attentively
now what was said formerly: oblations and tithes belong to Christ our High Priest,
and to those who minister to Him. Tenths of salvation are the first letter of the name of
Jesus. Hear, O thou Holy Catholic Church, who hast escaped the ten plagues, and hast re-
ceived the ten commandments, and hast learned the law, and hast kept the faith, and hast
believed in Jesus, and hast known the decad, and hast believed in the iota which is the first
letter of the name of Jesus,600 and art named after His name, and art established, and shinest
in the consummation of His glory. Those which were then the sacrifices now are prayers,
and intercessions, and thanksgivings. Those which were then first-fruits, and tithes, and
offerings, and gifts, now are oblations, which are presented by holy bishops to the Lord God,
through Jesus Christ, who has died for them. For these are your high priests, as the presbyters
are your priests, and your present deacons instead of your Levites; as are also your readers,
your singers, your porters, your deaconesses, your widows, your virgins, and your orphans:
but He who is above all these is the High Priest.</p>

over the clergy, and by which he is to govern all the people. But let the deacon minister to
him, as Christ does to His Father;603 and let him serve him unblameably in all things, as
Christ does nothing of Himself, but does always those things that please His Father. Let also
the deaconess be honoured by you in the place of the Holy Ghost, and not do or say anything
without the deacon; as neither does the Comforter say or do anything of Himself, but gives
glory to Christ by waiting for His pleasure. And as we cannot believe on Christ without the
teaching of the Spirit, so let not any woman address herself to the deacon or bishop without
the deaconess. Let the presbyters be esteemed by you to represent us the apostles, and let
them be the teachers of divine knowledge; since our Lord, when He sent us, said, “Go ye,
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you.”604 Let the widows and orphans be esteemed as representing the altar of burnt-offering;
and let the virgins be honoured as representing the altar of incense, and the incense itself.</p>

<head>THAT IT IS A HORRIBLE THING FOR A MAN TO THRUST HIMSELF INTO ANY

<p>XXVII. As, therefore, it was not lawful for one of another tribe, that was not a Levite,
to offer anything, or to approach the altar without the priest, so also do you do nothing
without the bishop;605 for if any one does anything without the bishop, he does it to no
purpose. For it will not be esteemed as of any avail to him. For as Saul, when he had offered
without Samuel, was told, “It will not avail for thee;”606 so every person among the laity,
doing anything without the priest, labours in vain. And as Uzziah the king,607 who was not
a priest, and yet would exercise the functions of the priests, was smitten with leprosy for his
transgression; so every lay person shall not be unpunished who despises God, and is so mad
as to affront His priests, and unjustly to snatch that honour to himself: not imitating Christ,
“who glorified not Himself to be made an high priest;”608 but waited till He heard from His
Father, “The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedek.”609 If, therefore, Christ did not glorify Himself without the Father, how dare

any man thrust himself into the priesthood who has not received that dignity from his superior,
and do such things which it is lawful only for the priests to do? Were not the followers
of Corah, even though they were of the tribe of Levi, consumed with fire, because they rose
up against Moses and Aaron, and meddled with such things as did not belong to them? And
Dathan and Abiram went down quick into hell; and the rod that budded put a stop to the
readiness of the multitude, and demonstrated who was the high priest ordained by God.610
You ought therefore, brethren, to bring your sacrifices and your oblations to the bishop, as
to your high priest, either by yourselves or by the deacons; and do you bring not those only,
but also your first-fruits, and your tithes, and your free-will offerings to him. For he knows
who they are that are in affliction, and gives to every one as is convenient, that so one may
not receive alms twice or oftener the same day, or the same week, while another has nothing
at all. For it is reasonable rather to supply the wants of those who really are in distress, than
of those who only appear to be so.</p>

<head>OF AN ENTERTAINMENT, AND AFTER WHAT MANNER EACH DISTINCT ORDER

<p>XXVIII. If any determine to invite elder women to an entertainment of love, or a feast,
as our Saviour calls it,611 let them most frequently send to such a one whom the deacons
know to be in distress. But let what is the pastor’s due, I mean the first-fruits,612 be set apart
in the feast for him, even though he be not at the entertainment, as being your priest, and
in honour of that God who has entrusted him with the priesthood. But as much as is given
to every one of the elder women, let double so much be given to the deacons, in honour of
Christ. Let also a double portion be set apart for the presbyters, as for such who labour
continually about the word and doctrine, upon the account of the apostles of our Lord,
whose place they sustain, as the counsellors of the bishop and the crown of the Church. For
they are the Sanhedrim and senate of the Church. If there be a reader there, let him receive
a single portion, in honour of the prophets, and let the singer and the porter have as much.
Let the laity, therefore, pay proper honours in their presents, and utmost marks of respect
to each distinct order. But let them not on all occasions trouble their governor, but let them
signify their desires by those who minister to him, that is, by the deacons, with whom they
may be more free. For neither may we address ourselves to Almighty God, but only by
Christ. In the same manner, therefore, let the laity make known all their desires to the
bishop by the deacon, and accordingly let them act as he shall direct them. For there was
no holy thing offered or done in the temple formerly without the priest. “For the priest’s

says, “for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.”613 For if the worshippers of
demons, in their hateful, abominable, and impure performances, imitate the sacred rules
till this very day (it is a wide comparison indeed, and there is a vast distance between their
abominations and God’s sacred worship), in their mockeries of worship they neither offer
nor do anything without their pretended priest, but esteem him as the very mouth of their
idols of stone, waiting to see what commands he will lay upon them. And whatsoever he
commands them, that they do, and without him they do nothing; and they honour him,
their pretended priest, and esteem his name as venerable in honour of lifeless statues, and
in order to the worship of wicked spirits. If these heathens, therefore, who give glory to lying
vanities, and place their hope upon nothing that is firm, endeavour to imitate the sacred
rules, how much more reasonable is it that you, who have a most certain faith and undoubted
hope, and who expect glorious, and eternal, and never-failing promises, should honour the
Lord God in those set over you, and esteem your bishop to be the mouth of God!</p>

<p>XXIX. For if Aaron, because he declared to Pharaoh the words of God from Moses, is
called a prophet; and Moses himself is called a god to Pharaoh, on account of his being at
once a king and a high priest, as God says to him, “I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and

<p>XXX. For now the deacon is to you Aaron, and the bishop Moses. If, therefore, Moses
was called a god by the Lord, let the bishop be honoured among you as a god, and the deacon
as his prophet. For as Christ does nothing without His Father, so neither does the deacon
do anything without his bishop; and as the Son without His Father is nothing, so is the
deacon nothing without his bishop; and as the Son is subject to His Father, so is every deacon
subject to his bishop; and as the Son is the messenger and prophet of the Father, so is the
deacon the messenger and prophet of his bishop. Wherefore let all things that he is to do

he gives it so that it must tend to the reproach of the bishop, and he accuses him as careless
of the distressed. But he that casts reproach on his bishop, either by word or deed, opposes
God, not hearkening to what He says: “Thou shalt not speak evil of the gods.”615 For He
did not make that law concerning deities of wood and of stone, which are abominable, because
they are falsely called gods, but concerning the priests and the judges, to whom He
also said, “Ye are gods, and children of the Most High.”616</p>

in mind of him, and so give to him; but do nothing in a clandestine way, so as may tend to
his reproach, lest thou raise a murmur against him; for the murmur will not be against him,
but against the Lord God: and the deacon, with the rest, will hear what Aaron and Miriam
heard, when they spake against Moses: “How is it that ye were not afraid to speak against
my servant Moses?”617 And again, Moses says to those who rose up against him: “Your
murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord our God.”618 For if he that calls one of
the laity Raka,619 or fool, shall not be unpunished, as doing injury to the name620 of Christ,
how dare any man speak against his bishop, by whom the Lord gave the Holy Spirit among
you upon the laying on of his hands, by whom ye have learned the sacred doctrines, and
have known God, and have believed in Christ, by whom ye were known of God, by whom
ye were sealed with the oil of gladness and the ointment of understanding, by whom ye were
declared to be the children of light, by whom the Lord in your illumination testified by the
imposition of the bishop’s hands, and sent out His sacred voice upon every one of you,
saying, “Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee?”621 By thy bishop, O man, God
adopts thee for His child. Acknowledge, O son, that right hand which was a mother to thee.

Spirit, who have fed you with the word as with milk, who have nourished you with doctrine,
who have confirmed you by their admonitions, who have imparted to you the saving body
and precious blood of Christ, who have loosed you from your sins, who have made you
partakers of the holy and sacred eucharist, who have admitted you to be partakers and fellowheirs

<head>THAT PRIESTS ARE TO BE PREFERRED BEFORE RULERS AND KINGS.</head>
<p>XXXIV. Account these worthy to be esteemed your rulers and your kings, and bring
them tribute as to kings; for by you they and their families ought to be maintained. As
Samuel made constitutions for the people concerning a king,624 in the first book of Kings,
and Moses did so concerning priests in Leviticus, so do we also make constitutions for you
concerning bishops. For if there the multitude distributed the inferior services in proportion
to so great a king, ought not therefore the bishop much more now to receive of you those
things which are determined by God for the sustenance of himself and of the rest of the
clergy belonging to him? But if we may add somewhat further, let the bishop receive more
than the other received of old: for he only managed the affairs of the soldiery, being entrusted
with war and peace for the preservation of men’s bodies; but the other is entrusted with the
exercise of the priestly office in relation to God, in order to preserve both body and soul
from dangers. By how much, therefore, the soul is more valuable than the body, so much
the priestly office is beyond the kingly. For it binds and looses those that are worthy of
punishment or of remission. Wherefore you ought to love the bishop as your father, and
fear him as your king, and honour him as your lord, bringing to him your fruits and the
works of your hands, for a blessing upon you, giving to him your first-fruits, and your tithes,
and your oblations, and your gifts, as to the priest of God; the first-fruits of your wheat, and

thee. And thy offering shall be accepted as a savour of a sweet smell to the Lord thy God;

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<head>THAT BOTH THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL PRESCRIBE OFFERINGS.</head>
<p>XXXV. Now you ought to know, that although the Lord has delivered you from the
additional bonds, and has brought you out of them to your refreshment, and does not permit
you to sacrifice irrational creatures for sin-offerings, and purifications, and scapegoats, and
continual washings and sprinklings, yet has He nowhere freed you from those oblations
which you owe to the priests, nor from doing good to the poor. For the Lord says to you in
the Gospel: “Unless your righteousness abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees,
ye shall by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.”627 Now herein will your righteousness
exceed theirs, if you take greater care of the priests, the orphans, and the widows; as it
is written: “He hath scattered abroad; he hath given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth
for ever.”628 And again: “By acts of righteousness and faith iniquities are purged.”629 And
again: “Every bountiful soul is blessed.”630 So therefore shalt thou do as the Lord has appointed,
and shalt give to the priest what things are due to him, the first-fruits of thy floor, and
of thy wine-press, and sin-offerings, as to the mediator between God and such as stand in
need of purgation and forgiveness. For it is thy duty to give, and his to administer, as being
the administrator and disposer of ecclesiastical affairs. Yet shalt thou not call thy bishop to
account, nor watch his administration, how he does it, when, or to whom, or where, or
whether he do it well or ill, or indifferently; for he has One who will call him to an account,
the Lord God, who put this administration into his hands, and thought him worthy of the
priesthood of so great dignity.</p>

the manifold workmanship of God, which received its beginning through Christ. Thou shalt
observe the Sabbath, on account of Him who ceased from His work of creation, but ceased
not from His work of providence: it is a rest for meditation of the law, not for idleness of
the hands. Reject every unlawful lust, everything destructive to men, and all anger. Honour
thy parents, as the authors of thy being. Love thy neighbour as thyself. Communicate the
necessaries of life to the needy. Avoid swearing falsely, and swearing often, and in vain; for
thou shalt not be held guiltless. Do not appear before the priests empty, and offer thy freewill
offerings continually. Moreover, do not leave the church of Christ; but go thither in the
morning before all thy work, and again meet there in the evening, to return thanks to God
that He has preserved thy life. Be diligent, and constant, and laborious in thy calling. Offer
to the Lord thy free-will offerings; for says He, “Honour the Lord with the fruit of thy honest
labours.”631 If thou art not able to cast anything considerable into the Corban,632 yet at least
bestow upon the strangers one, or two, or five mites. “Lay up to thyself heavenly treasure,
which neither the moth nor thieves can destroy.”633 And in doing this, do not judge thy
bishop, or any of thy neighbours among the laity; for if thou judge thy brother, thou becomest
a judge, without being constituted such by anybody, for the priests are only entrusted with
the power of judging. For to them it is said, “Judge righteous judgment;”634 and again

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>CONCERNING ACCUSERS AND FALSE ACCUSERS, AND HOW A JUDGE IS NOT
RASHLY EITHER TO BELIEVE THEM OR DISBELIEVE THEM, BUT AFTER AN
ACCURATE EXAMINATION.</head>
<p>XXXVII. But it is the duty of the bishop to judge rightly, as it is written, “Judge righteous
judgment;”637 and elsewhere, “Why do ye not even of yourselves judge what is right?”638
Be ye therefore as skilful dealers in money: for as these reject bad money, but take to themselves
what is current, in the same manner it is the bishops’s duty to retain the unblameable,
but either to heal, or, if they be past cure, to cast off those that are blameworthy, so as not
to be hasty in cutting off, nor to believe all accusations; for it sometimes happens that some,
either through passion or envy, do insist on a false accusation against a brother, as did the
two elders in the case of Susanna in Babylon,639 and the Egyptian woman in the case of
Joseph.640 Do thou therefore, as a man of God, not rashly receive such accusations, lest thou
take away the innocent and slay the righteous; for he that will receive such accusations is
the author of anger rather than of peace. But where there is anger, there the Lord is not; for
that anger, which is the friend of Satan—I mean that which is excited unjustly by the means
of false brethren—never suffers unanimity to be in the Church. Wherefore, when you know
such persons to be foolish, quarrelsome, passionate, and such as delight in mischief, do not
give credit to them; but observe such as they are, when you hear anything from them against
their brother: for murder is nothing in their eyes, and they cast a man down in such a way
as one would not suspect. Do thou therefore consider diligently the accuser,641 wisely observing
his mode of life, what, and of what sort it is; and in case thou findest him a man of
veracity, do according to the doctrine of our Lord,642 and taking him who is accused, rebuke
him, that he may repent, when nobody is by. But if he be not persuaded, take with thee out
or two more, and so show him his fault, and admonish him with mildness and instruction;
for “wisdom will rest upon an heart that is good, but is not understood in the heart of the
foolish.”643</p>

<head>THAT SINNERS ARE PRIVATELY TO BE REPROVED, AND THE PENITENT TO

<p>XXXVIII. If, therefore, he be persuaded by the mouth of you three, it is well. But if any
one hardens himself, “tell it to the Church: but if he neglects to hear the Church, let him be
to thee as an heathen man and a publican;”644 and receive him no longer into the Church
as a Christian, but reject him as an heathen. But if he be willing to repent, receive him. For
the Church does not receive an heathen or a publican to communion, before they every one
repent of their former impieties; for our Lord Jesus, the Christ of God, has appointed place
for the acceptance of men upon their repentance.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>EXAMPLES OF REPENTANCE.</head>
<p>XXXIX. For I Matthew, one of those twelve which speak to you in this doctrine, am an
apostle, having myself been formerly a publican, but now have obtained mercy through
believing, and have repented of my former practices, and have been vouchsafed the honour
to be an apostle and preacher of the word. And Zacchæus, whom the Lord received upon
his repentance and prayers to Him, was also himself in the same manner a publican at first.
And, besides, even the soldiers and multitude of publicans, who came to hear the word of
the Lord about repentance, heard this from the prophet John, after he had baptized them:
“Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.”645 In like manner, life is not refused
to the heathen, if they repent and cast away their unbelief. Esteem, therefore, every one that
is convicted of any wicked action, and has not repented, as a publican or an heathen. But if
he afterward repents, and turns from his error, then, as we receive the heathen, when they
wish to repent, into the Church indeed to hear the word, but do not receive them to communion
until they have received the seal of baptism, and are made complete Christians; so
do we also permit such as these to enter only to hear, until they show the fruit of repentance,
that by hearing the word they may not utterly and irrecoverably perish. But let them not be
admitted to communion in prayer; and let them depart after the reading of the law, and the
prophets, and the Gospel, that by such departure they may be made better in their course
of life, by endeavouring to meet every day about the public assemblies, and to be frequent
in prayer, that they also may be at length admitted, and that those who behold them may
be affected, and be more secured by fearing to fall into the same condition.</p>

or two offences, nor shalt thou exclude him from the word of the Lord, nor reject him from
common intercourse, since neither did the Lord refuse to eat with publicans and sinners;
and when He was accused by the Pharisees on this account, He said: “They that are well
have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.”646 Do you, therefore, live and dwell
with those who are separated from you for their sins; and take care of them, comforting
them, and confirming them, and saying to them: “Be strengthened, ye weak hands and feeble
knees.”647 For we ought to comfort those that mourn, and afford encouragement to the
fainthearted, lest by immoderate sorrow they degenerate into distraction, since “he that is
fainthearted is exceedingly distracted.”648</p>

<head>AFTER WHAT MANNER WE OUGHT TO RECEIVE A PENITENT; HOW WE OUGHT

<p>XLI. But if any one returns, and shows forth the fruit of repentance, then do ye receive
him to prayer, as the lost son, the prodigal, who had consumed his father’s substance with
harlots, who fed swine, and desired to be fed with husks, and could not obtain it. This son,
when he repented, and returned to his father, and said, “I have sinned against Heaven, and
before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son;”649 the father, full of affection to
his child, received him with music, and restored him his old robe, and ring, and shoes, and
slew the fatted calf, and made merry with his friends. Do thou therefore, O bishop, act in
the same manner. And as thou receivest an heathen after thou hast instructed and baptized
him, so do thou let all join in prayers for this man, and restore him by imposition of hands
to his ancient place among the flock, as one purified by repentance; and that imposition of
hands shall be to him instead of baptism: for by the laying on of our hands the Holy Ghost
was given to believers. And in case some one of those brethren who had stood immoveable
accuse thee, because thou art reconciled to him, say to him: “Thou art always with me, and
all that I have is thine. It was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead,
and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.” For that God does not only receive the penitent,
but restores them to their former dignity, holy David is a sufficient witness, who, after his
sin in the matter of Uriah, prayed to God, and said: “Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,

out all mine offences. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in my inward
parts. Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.”
Do thou therefore, as a compassionate physician, heal all that have sinned, making use of
saving methods of cure; not only cutting and searing, or using corrosives, but binding up,
and putting in tents, and using gentle healing medicines, and sprinkling comfortable words.
If it be an hollow wound, or great gash, nourish it with a suitable plaister, that it may be
filled up, and become even with the rest of the whole flesh. If it be foul, cleanse it with corrosive
powder, that is, with the words of reproof. If it have proud flesh, eat it down with a
sharp plaister—the threats of judgment. If it spreads further, sear it, and cut off the putrid
flesh, mortifying him with fastings. But if, after all that thou hast done, thou perceivest that
from the feet to the head there is no room for a fomentation, or oil, or bandage, but that the
malady spreads and prevents all cure, as a gangrene which corrupts the entire member;
then, with a great deal of consideration, and the advice of other skilful physicians, cut off
the putrefied member, that the whole body of the Church be not corrupted. Be not therefore
ready and hasty to cut off, nor do thou easily have recourse to the saw, with its many teeth;
but first use a lancet to lay open the wound, that the inward cause whence the pain is derived
being drawn out, may keep the body free from pain. But if thou seest any one past repentance,
and he is become insensible, then cut off the incurable from the Church with sorrow and
lamentation. For: “Take out from among yourselves that wicked person.”651 And: “Ye shall
make the children of Israel to fear.”652 And again: “Thou shalt not accept the persons of the
rich in judgment.”653 And: “Thou shalt not pity a poor man in his cause: for the judgment
is the Lord’s.”654</p>

any persons unjustly, and so to assist the wicked. For “woe to him that calls evil good, and
good evil; bitter sweet, and sweet bitter; that puts light for darkness, and darkness for light.”658
Take care, therefore, lest by any means ye become acceptors of persons, and thereby fall under
this voice of the Lord.659 For if you condemn others unjustly, you pass sentence against
yourselves. For the Lord says: “With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and as you
condemn, you shall be condemned.”660 If, therefore, ye judge without respect of persons,
ye will discover that accuser who bears false witness against his neighbour, and will prove
him to be a sycophant, a spiteful person, and a murderer, causing perplexity by accusing
the man as if he were wicked, inconstant in his words, contradicting himself in what he affirms,
and entangled with the words of his own mouth; for his own lips are a dangerous
snare to him: whom, when thou hast convicted him of speaking falsely, thou shalt judge
severely, and shalt deliver him to the fiery sword, and thou shalt do to him as he wickedly
proposed to do to his brother; for as much as in him lay he slew his brother, by forestalling
the ears of the judge.661 Now it is written, that “he that sheddeth man’s blood, for that his

and the man recovers his natural good shape by the means of the surgeon; how much more
ought you, the pastors of the Church (for the Church is a perfect body, and sound members;
of such as believe in God, in the fear of the Lord, and in love), to do the like when there is
found in it a superfluous member with wicked designs, and rendering the rest of the body
unseemly, and disturbing it with sedition, and war, and evil-speaking; causing fears, disturbances,
blots, evil-speaking, accusations, disorders, and doing the like works of the devil, as
if he were ordained by the devil to cast a reproach on the Church by calumnies, and mighty
disorders, and strife, and division! Such a one, therefore, when he is a second time cast out
of the Church, is justly cut off entirely from the congregation of the Lord. And now the
Church of the Lord will be more beautiful than it was before, when it had a superfluous,
and to itself a disagreeable member. Wherefore henceforward it will be free from blame and
reproach, and become clear of such wicked, deceitful, abusive, unmerciful, traitorous persons;
of such as are “haters of those that are good, lovers of pleasure,”664 affecters of vainglory,
deceivers, and pretenders to wisdom; of such as make it their business to scatter, or rather

His Father. But let him order such things as he is able by himself, receiving power from the bishop, as the Lord did from His Father the power
of creation and of providence. But the weighty matters let the bishop judge; but let the deacon be the bishop’s ear, and eye, and mouth, and heart,

it not come before an heathen tribunal. Nay, indeed, you are not to permit that the rulers

giving a piece of money was freed from disturbance.671 Choose therefore rather to suffer
harm, and to endeavour after those things that make for peace, not only among the brethren,
but also among the unbelievers. For by suffering loss in the affairs of this life, thou wilt be
sure not to suffer in the concerns of piety, and wilt live religiously, and according to the
command of Christ.672 But if brethren have lawsuits one with another, which God forbid,
you who are the rulers ought thence to learn that such as these do not do the work of brethren
in the Lord, but rather of public enemies; and one of the parties will be found to be mild,
gentle, and the child of light; but the other unmerciful, insolent, and covetous. Let him,
therefore, who is condemned be rebuked, let him be separated, let him undergo the punishment
of his hatred to his brother. Afterwards, when he repents, let him be received; and so,
when they have learned prudence, they will ease your judicatures. It is also a duty to forgive
each other’s trespasses—not the duty of those that judge, but of those that have quarrels; as
the Lord determined when I Peter asked Him, “How oft shall my brother sin against me,
and I forgive him? Till seven times?” He replied, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but
until seventy times seven.”673 For so would our Lord have us to be truly His disciples, and
never to have anything against anybody; as, for instance, anger without measure, passion
without mercy, covetousness without justice, hatred without reconciliation. Draw by your
instruction those who are angry to friendship, and those who are at variance to agreement.

God.”674</p>

<head>THAT THE SAME PUNISHMENT IS NOT TO BE INFLICTED FOR EVERY OFFENCE,
BUT DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS FOR DIFFERENT OFFENDERS.</head>
<p>XLVIII. Do not pass the same sentence for every sin, but one suitable to each crime,
distinguishing all the several sorts of offences with much prudence, the great from the little.
Treat a wicked action after one manner, and a wicked word after another; a bare intention
still otherwise. So also in the case of a contumely or suspicion. And some thou shalt curb
by threatenings alone; some thou shalt punish with fines to the poor; some thou shalt mortify
with fastings; and others thou shalt separate according to the greatness of their several
crimes. For the law did not allot the same punishment to every offence, but had a different
regard to a sin against God, against the priest, against the temple, or against the sacrifice;
from a sin against the king, or ruler, or a soldier, or a fellow-subject; and so were the offences
different which were against a servant, a possession, or a brute creature. And again, sins
were differently rated according as they were against parents and kinsmen, and those differently
which were done on purpose from those that happened involuntarily. Accordingly
the punishments were different: as death either by crucifixion or by stoning, fines, scourgings,
or the suffering the same mischiefs they had done to others. Wherefore do you also allot
different penalties to different offences, lest any injustice should happen, and provoke God
to indignation. For of what unjust judgment soever you are the instruments, of the same
you shall receive the reward from God. “For with what judgment ye judge ye shall be
judged.”678</p>

amine diligently concerning those who appear before you; and first concerning the accuser,
whether this be the first person he has accused, or whether he has advanced accusations
against some others before, and whether this contest and accusation of theirs does not arise
from some quarrel, and what sort of life the accuser leads. Yet, though he be of a good conscience,
do not give credit to him alone, for that is contrary to the law; but let him have
others to join in his testimony, and those of the same course of life. As the law says: “At the
mouth of two or three witnesses everything shall be established.”679 But why did we say that
the character of the witnesses was to be inquired after, of what sort it is? Because it frequently
happens that two and more testify for mischief, and with joint consent prefer a lie; as did
the two elders against Susanna in Babylon,680 and the sons of transgressors against Naboth
in Samaria,681 and the multitude of the Jews against our Lord at Jerusalem,682 and against
Stephen His first martyr.683 Let the witnesses therefore be meek, free from anger, full of
equity, kind, prudent, continent, free from wickedness, faithful, religious; for the testimony
of such persons is firm on account of their character, and true on account of their mode of
life. But as to those of a different character, do not ye receive their testimony, although they
seem to agree together in their evidence against the accused; for it is ordained in the law:
“Thou shalt not be with a multitude for wickedness; thou shalt not receive a vain report;
thou shalt not consent with a multitude to pervert judgment.”684 You ought also particularly
to know him that is accused; what he is in his course and mode of life; whether he have a
good report as to his life; whether he has been unblameable; whether he has been zealous
in holiness; whether he be a lover of the widows, a lover of the strangers, a lover of the poor,
and a lover of the brethren; whether he be not given to filthy lucre; whether he be not an
extravagant person, or a spendthrift; whether he be sober, and free from luxury, or a
drunkard, or a glutton; whether he be compassionate and charitable.</p>

safe and firm. And if, after his separation, he begs pardon, and falls down before the
bishop, and acknowledges his fault, receive him. But neither do you suffer a false accuser
to go unpunished, that he may not calumniate another who lives well, or encourage some
other person to do like him. Nor, to be sure, do ye suffer a person convicted to go off clear,
lest another be ensnared in the same crimes. For neither shall a witness of mischiefs be unpunished,

fence to the accusation brought against him, and rashly give your votes for condemnation,
you will be found guilty of that man’s destruction, and partaker with the false accuser before
God, the just Judge. For “as he that holdeth the tail of a dog, so is he that presides at unjust
judgment.”685 But if ye become imitators of the elders in Babylon, who, when they had
borne witness against Susanna, unjustly condemned her to death, you will become obnoxious
to their judgment and condemnation. For the Lord by Daniel delivered Susanna from the
hand of the ungodly, but condemned to the fire those elders who were guilty of her blood,
and reproaches you by him, saying: “Are ye so foolish, ye children of Israel? Without examination,
and without knowing the truth, have ye condemned a daughter of Israel? Return

send him out to punishment; but for several days they make inquiry about him with a full

death against him, lifts up his hands to the sun, and solemnly affirms that he is innocent of
the blood of the man. Though they be heathens, and know not the Deity, nor the vengeance
which will fall upon men from God on account of those that are justly condemned, they

<head>THAT CHRISTIANS OUGHT NOT TO BE CONTENTIOUS ONE WITH ANOTHER.</head>
<p>LIII. But you who know who our God is, and what are His judgments, how can you
bear to pass an unjust judgment, since your sentence will be immediately known to God?
And if you have judged righteously, you will be deemed worthy of the recompenses of
righteousness, both now and hereafter; but if unrighteously, you will partake of the like. We
therefore advise you, brethren, rather to deserve commendation from God than rebukes;
for the commendation of God is eternal life to men, as is His rebuke everlasting death. Be
ye therefore righteous judges, peacemakers, and without anger. For “he that is angry with
his brother without a cause is obnoxious to the judgment.”687 But if it happens that by any
one’s contrivance you are angry at anybody, “let not the sun go down upon your wrath;”688
for says David, “Be angry and sin not;”689 that is, be soon reconciled, lest your wrath continue
so long that it turn to a settled hatred, and work sin. “For the souls of those that bear a settled
hatred are to death,”690 says Solomon. But our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ says in the
Gospels: “If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath
ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift to God.”691 Now the gift to God is every
one’s prayer and thanksgiving. If, therefore, thou hast anything against thy brother, or he
has anything against thee, neither will thy prayers be heard, nor will thy thanksgivings be
accepted, by reason of that hidden anger. But it is your duty, brethren, to pray continually.
Yet, because God hears not those which are at enmity with their brethren by unjust quarrels,
even though they should pray three times an hour, it is our duty to compose all our enmity
and littleness of soul, that we may be able to pray with a pure and unpolluted heart. For the
Lord commanded us to love even our enemies, and by no means to hate our friends. And
the lawgiver says: “Thou shalt not hate any man; thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy mind.
Thou shalt certainly reprove thy brother, and not incur sin on his account.”692 “Thou shalt
not hate an Egyptian, for thou wast a sojourner with him. Thou shalt not hate an Idumæan,
for he is thy brother.”693 And David says: “If I have repaid those that requited me evil.”694
Wherefore, if thou wilt be a Christian, follow the law of the Lord: “Loose every band of
wickedness;”695 for the Lord has given thee authority to remit those sins to thy brother

to do it now, when thou also hast heard Jeremiah saying, “Do not any of you impute the
wickedness of his neighbour in your hearts?”697 But thou rememberest injuries, and keepest
enmity, and comest into judgment, and art suspicious of His anger, and thy prayer is
hindered. Nay, if thou hast remitted to thy brother four hundred and ninety times, do thou
still multiply thy acts of gentleness more, to do good for thy own sake. Although he does
not do so, yet, however, do thou endeavour to forgive thy brother for God’s sake, “that thou
mayest be the son of thy Father which is in heaven,”698 and when thou prayest, mayest be

psalmody, and the instruction out of the Scriptures, let the deacon stand nigh you, and with
a loud voice say: Let none have any quarrel with another; let none come in hypocrisy; that
if there be any controversy found among any of you, they may be affected in conscience,
and may pray to God, and be reconciled to their brethren. For if, upon coming into any
one’s house, we are to say, “Peace be to this house,”699 like sons of peace bestowing peace
on those who are worthy, as it is written, “He came and preached peace to you that are nigh,
and them that are far off, whom the Lord knows to be His,”700 much more is it incumbent
on those that enter into the Church of God before all things to pray for the peace of God.
But if he prays for it upon others, much more let himself be within the same, as a child of
light; for he that has it not within himself is not fit to bestow it upon others. Wherefore,
before all things, it is our duty to be at peace in our own minds; for he that does not find
any disorder in himself will not quarrel with another, but will be peaceable, friendly, gathering
the Lord’s people, and a fellow-worker with him, in order to the increasing the number of
those that shall be saved in unanimity. For those who contrive enmities, and strifes, and
contests, and lawsuits, are wicked, and aliens from God.</p>

<head>AN ENUMERATION OF THE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE,
AND HOW IN EVERY AGE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD GOD HAS
INVITED ALL MEN TO REPENTANCE.</head>
<p>LV. For God, being a God of mercy from the beginning, called every generation to repentance
by righteous men and prophets. He instructed those before the flood by Abel and
Sem, and Seth, also by Enos, and by Enoch that was translated; those at the flood by Noah;
the inhabitants of Sodom by hospitable Lot; those after the flood by Melchizedek, and the
patriarchs, and Job the beloved of God; the Egyptians by Moses; the Israelites by him, and
Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas, and the rest; those after the law by angels and prophets,
and the same by His own incarnation701 of the Virgin; those a little before His bodily appearance
by John His forerunner, and the same by the same person after Christ’s birth,
saying, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;”702 those after His passion by us,
the twelve apostles, and Paul the chosen vessel. We therefore, who have been vouchsafed
the favour of being the witnesses of His appearance, together with James the brother of our
Lord, and the other seventy-two disciples, and his seven deacons, have heard from the mouth
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by exact knowledge declare “what is the will of God, that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will”703 which is made known to us by Jesus; that none should
perish, but that all men with one accord should believe in Him, and send unanimously praise
to Him, and thereby live for ever.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<head>THAT IT IS THE WILL OF GOD THAT MEN SHOULD BE OF ONE MIND IN
MATTERS OF RELIGION, IN ACCORD WITH THE HEAVENLY POWERS.</head>
<p>LVI. For this is that which our Lord taught us when we pray to say to His Father, “Thy
will be done, as in heaven, so upon earth;”704 that as the heavenly natures of the incorporeal
powers do all glorify God with one consent, so also upon earth all men with one mouth and
one purpose may glorify the only, the one, and the true God, by Christ His only-begotten.
It is therefore His will that men should praise Him with unanimity, and adore Him with
one consent.705 For this is His will in Christ, that those who are saved by Him may be many;
but that you do not occasion any loss or diminution to Him, nor to the Church, or lessen
the number by one soul of man, as destroyed by you, which might have been saved by repentance;
and which therefore perishes not only by its own sin, but also by your treachery
besides, whereby you fulfil that which is written, “He that gathereth not with me,

scattereth.”706 Such a one is a disperser of the sheep, an adversary, an enemy of God, a
destroyer of those lambs whose Shepherd was the Lord, and we were the collectors out of
various nations and tongues, by much pains and danger, and perpetual labour, by watchings,
by fastings, by lyings on the ground, by persecutions, by stripes, by imprisonments, that we
might do the will of God, and fill the feast-chamber with guests to sit down at His table, that
is, the holy and Catholic Church, with joyful and chosen people, singing hymns and praises
to God that has called them by us to life. And you, as much as in you lies, have dispersed
them. Do you also of the laity be at peace with one another, endeavouring like wise men to
increase the Church, and to turn back, and tame, and restore those which seem wild. For
this is the greatest reward by His promise from God, “If thou fetch out the worthy and precious
from the unworthy, thou shalt be as my mouth.”707</p>

<head>SEC. VII.—ON ASSEMBLING IN THE CHURCH.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF A CHURCH AND THE CLERGY, AND WHAT THINGS
IN PARTICULAR EVERY ONE IS TO DO IN THE SOLEMN ASSEMBLIES OF THE
CLERGY AND LAITY FOR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.</head>
<p>LVII. But be thou, O bishop, holy, unblameable, no striker, not soon angry, not cruel;
but a builder up, a converter, apt to teach, forbearing of evil, of a gentle mind, meek, longsuffering,
ready to exhort, ready to comfort, as a man of God.</p>
<p>When thou callest an assembly of the Church as one that is the commander of a great
ship, appoint the assemblies to be made with all possible skill, charging the deacons as
mariners to prepare places for the brethren as for passengers, with all due care and decency.
And first, let the building be long, with its head to the east, with its vestries on both sides at
the east end, and so it will be like a ship. In the middle let the bishop’s throne be placed, and
on each side of him let the presbytery sit down; and let the deacons stand near at hand, in
close and small girt garments, for they are like the mariners and managers of the ship: with
regard to these, let the laity sit on the other side, with all quietness and good order. And let
the women sit by themselves, they also keeping silence. In the middle, let the reader stand
upon some high place: let him read the books of Moses, of Joshua the son of Nun, of the
Judges, and of the Kings and of the Chronicles, and those written after the return from the
captivity; and besides these, the books of Job and of Solomon, and of the sixteen prophets.
But when there have been two lessons severally read, let some other person sing the hymns
of David, and let the people join at the conclusions of the verses. Afterwards let our Acts be
read, and the Epistles of Paul our fellow-worker, which he sent to the churches under the
conduct of the Holy Spirit; and afterwards let a deacon or a presbyter read the Gospels, both
those which I Matthew and John have delivered to you, and those which the fellow-workers
of Paul received and left to you, Luke and Mark. And while the Gospel is read, let all the
presbyters and deacons, and all the people, stand up in great silence; for it is written: “Be
silent, and hear, O Israel.”708 And again: “But do thou stand there, and hear.”709 In the next
place, let the presbyters one by one, not all together, exhort the people, and the bishop in
the last place, as being the commander. Let the porters stand at the entries of the men, and
observe them. Let the deaconesses also stand at those of the women, like shipmen. For the
same description and pattern was both in the tabernacle of the testimony and in the temple
of God.710 But if any one be found sitting out of his place, let him be rebuked by the deacon,
as a manager of the foreship, and be removed into the place proper for him; for the Church

is not only like a ship, but also like a sheepfold. For as the shepherds place all the brute
creatures distinctly, I mean goats and sheep, according to their kind and age, and still every
one runs together, like to his like; so is it to be in the Church. Let the young persons sit by
themselves, if there be a place for them; if not, let them stand upright. But let those that are
already stricken in years sit in order. For the children which stand, let their fathers and
mothers take them to them. Let the younger women also sit by themselves, if there be a
place for them; but if there be not, let them stand behind the women. Let those women
which are married, and have children, be placed by themselves; but let the virgins, and the
widows, and the elder women, stand or sit before all the rest; and let the deacon be the disposer
of the places, that every one of those that comes in may go to his proper place, and
may not sit at the entrance. In like manner, let the deacon oversee the people, that nobody
may whisper, nor slumber, nor laugh, nor nod; for all ought in the church to stand wisely,
and soberly, and attentively, having their attention fixed upon the word of the Lord. After
this, let all rise up with one consent, and looking towards the east, after the catechumens
and penitents are gone out, pray to God eastward, who ascended up to the heaven of heavens
to the east; remembering also the ancient situation of paradise in the east, from whence the
first man, when he had yielded to the persuasion of the serpent, and disobeyed the command
of God, was expelled. As to the deacons, after the prayer is over, let some of them attend
upon the oblation of the Eucharist, ministering to the Lord’s body with fear. Let others of
them watch the multitude, and keep them silent. But let that deacon who is at the high
priest’s hand say to the people, Let no one have any quarrel against another; let no one come
in hypocrisy. Then let the men give the men, and the women give the women, the Lord’s
kiss. But let no one do it with deceit, as Judas betrayed the Lord with a kiss. After this let
the deacon pray for the whole Church, for the whole world, and the several parts of it, and
the fruits of it; for the priests and the rulers, for the high priest and the king, and the peace
of the universe. After this let the high priest pray for peace upon the people, and bless them,
as Moses commanded the priests to bless the people, in these words: “The Lord bless thee,
and keep thee: the Lord make His face to shine upon thee,711 and give thee peace.”712 Let
the bishop pray for the people, and say: “Save Thy people, O Lord, and bless Thine inheritance,
which Thou hast obtained with the precious blood of Thy Christ, and hast called a
royal priesthood, and an holy nation.”713 After this let the sacrifice follow, the people
standing, and praying silently; and when the oblation has been made, let every rank by itself
partake of the Lord’s body and precious blood in order, and approach with reverence and
holy fear, as to the body of their king. Let the women approach with their heads covered,

not yet initiated, come in.714</p>

<head>OF COMMENDATORY LETTERS IN FAVOUR OF STRANGERS, LAY PERSONS,
CLERGYMEN, AND BISHOPS; AND THAT THOSE WHO COME INTO THE CHURCH
ASSEMBLIES ARE TO BE RECEIVED WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR QUALITY.</head>
<p>LVIII. If any brother, man or woman, come in from another parish, bringing recommendatory
letters, let the deacon be the judge of that affair, inquiring whether they be of
the faithful, and of the Church? whether they be not defiled by heresy? and besides, whether
the party be a married woman or a widow? And when he is satisfied in these questions, that
they are really of the faithful, and of the same sentiments in the things of the Lord, let him
conduct every one to the place proper for him. And if a presbyter comes from another parish,
let him be received to communion by the presbyters; if a deacon, by the deacons; if a bishop,
let him sit with the bishop, and be allowed the same honour with himself; and thou, O
bishop, shalt desire him to speak to the people words of instruction: for the exhortation and
admonition of strangers is very acceptable, and exceeding profitable. For, as the Scripture
says, “no prophet is accepted in his own country.”715 Thou shalt also permit him to offer
the Eucharist; but if, out of reverence to thee, and as a wise man, to preserve the honour
belonging to thee, he will not offer, at least thou shalt compel him to give the blessing to the
people. But if, after the congregation is sat down, any other person comes upon you of good
fashion and character in the world, whether he be a stranger, or one of your own country,
neither do thou, O bishop, if thou art speaking the word of God, or hearing him that sings
or reads, accept persons so far as to leave the ministry of the word, that thou mayest appoint
an upper place for him; but continue quiet, not interrupting thy discourse, nor thy attention.
But let the brethren receive him by the deacons; and if there be not a place, let the deacon
by speaking, but not in anger, raise the junior, and place the stranger there. And it is but
reasonable that one that loves the brethren should do so of his own accord; but if he refuse,
let him raise him up by force, and set him behind all, that the rest may be taught to give
place to those that are more honourable. Nay, if a poor man, or one of a mean family, or a
stranger, comes upon you, whether he be old or young, and there be no place, the deacon
shall find a place for even these, and that with all his heart; that, instead of accepting persons
before men, his ministration towards God may be well-pleasing. The very same thing let
the deaconess do to those women, whether poor or rich, that come unto them.</p>

<head>THAT EVERY CHRISTIAN OUGHT TO FREQUENT THE CHURCH DILIGENTLY
BOTH MORNING AND EVENING.</head>
<p>LIX. When thou instructest the people, O bishop, command and exhort them to come
constantly to church morning and evening every day, and by no means to forsake it on any
account, but to assemble together continually; neither to diminish the Church by withdrawing
themselves, and causing the body of Christ to be without its member. For it is not only
spoken concerning the priests, but let every one of the laity hearken to it as concerning
himself, considering that it is said by the Lord: “He that is not with me is against me, and
he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.”716 Do not you therefore scatter yourselves
abroad, who are the members of Christ, by not assembling together, since you have Christ
your head, according to His promise, present, and communicating to you.717 Be not careless
of yourselves, neither deprive your Saviour of His own members, neither divide His body
nor disperse His members, neither prefer the occasions of this life to the word of God; but
assemble yourselves together every day, morning and evening, singing psalms and praying
in the Lord’s house: in the morning saying the sixty-second Psalm, and in the evening the
hundred and fortieth, but principally on the Sabbath-day. And on the day of our Lord’s resurrection,
which is the Lord’s day, meet more diligently, sending praise to God that made
the universe by Jesus, and sent Him to us, and condescended to let Him suffer, and raised
Him from the dead. Otherwise what apology will he make to God who does not assemble
on that day to hear the saving word concerning the resurrection, on which we pray thrice
standing in memory of Him who arose in three days, in which is performed the reading of
the prophets, the preaching of the Gospel, the oblation of the sacrifice, the gift of the holy
food?</p>

than you?”718 as He says, by way of reproach, to Jerusalem, “Sodom is justified rather than
thou.” For if the Gentiles every day, when they arise from sleep, run to their idols to worship
them, and before all their work and all their labours do first of all pray to them, and in their

feasts and in their solemnities do not keep away, but attend upon them; and not only those
upon the place, but those living far distant do the same; and in their public shows all come
together, as into a synagogue: in the same manner those which are vainly called Jews, when
they have worked six days, on the seventh day rest, and come together into their synagogue,
never leaving nor neglecting either rest from labour or assembling together, while yet they
are deprived of the efficacy of the word in their unbelief, nay, and of the force of that name
Judah, by which they call themselves,—for Judah is interpreted Confession,—but these do
not confess to God (having unjustly occasioned the suffering on the cross), so as to be saved
on their repentance;—if, therefore, those who are not saved frequently assemble together
for such purposes as do not profit them, what apology wilt thou make to the Lord God who
forsakest His Church, not imitating so much as the heathen, but by such thy absence
growest slothful, or turnest apostate, or actest wickedness? To whom the Lord says by
Jeremiah: “Ye have not kept my ordinances; nay, ye have not walked according to the ordinances
of the heathen, and you have in a manner exceeded them.”719 And again: “Israel has
justified his soul more than treacherous Judah.”720 And afterwards: “Will the Gentiles change
their gods which are not gods?721 Wherefore pass over to the isles of Chittim, and behold,
and send to Kedar, and observe diligently whether such things have been done. For those
nations have not changed their ordinances; but,” says He, “my people has changed its glory
for that which will not profit.”722 How, therefore, will any one make his apology who has
despised or absented himself from the church of God?</p>

pretences for his sins,” let such a one know that the trades of the faithful are works by the
by, but the worship of God is their great work. Follow therefore your trades as by the by,
for your maintenance, but make the worship of God your main business; as also our Lord
said: “Labour not for the meat which perishes, but for that which endureth unto everlasting
life.”723 And again: “This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”724
Endeavour therefore never to leave the Church of God; but if any one overlooks it, and goes

what apology will such a one make to God in the day of judgment, who has forsaken the
oracles of the living God, and the living and quickening oracles, such as are able to deliver
from eternal punishment, and has gone into an house of demons, or into a synagogue of
the murderers of Christ, or the congregation of the wicked?—not hearkening unto him that
says: “I have hated the congregation of the wicked, and I will not enter with the ungodly. I
have not sat with the assembly of vanity, neither will I sit with the ungodly.”725 And again:
“Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way
of sinners, and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law of the
Lord, and in His law will he meditate day and night.”726 But thou, forsaking the gathering
together of the faithful, the Church of God, and His laws, hast respect to those “dens of
thieves,” calling those things holy which He has called profane, and making such things
unclean which He has sanctified. And not only so, but thou already runnest after the pomps
of the Gentiles, and hastenest to their theatres, being desirous to be reckoned one of those
that enter into them, and to partake of unseemly, not to say abominable words; not hearkening
to Jeremiah, who says, “O Lord, I have not sat in their assemblies, for they are scorners;
but I was afraid because of Thy hand;”727 nor to Job, who speaks in like manner, “If I have
gone at any time with the scornful; for I shall be weighed in a just balance.”728 But why wilt
thou be a partaker of the heathen oracles, which are nothing but dead men declaring by the
inspiration of the devil deadly things, and such as tend to subvert the faith, and to draw
those that attend to them to polytheism? Do you therefore, who attend to the laws. of God,
esteem those laws more honourable than the necessities of this life, and pay a greater respect
to them, and run together to the Church of the Lord, “which He has purchased with the
blood of Christ, the beloved, the first-born of every creature.”729 For this Church is the
daughter of the Highest, which has been in travail of you by the word of grace, and has
“formed Christ in you,” of whom you are made partakers, and thereby become His holy
and chosen members, “not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but as being holy and
unspotted in the faith, ye are complete in Him, after the image of God that created you.”730</p>

<head>THAT CHRISTIANS MUST ABSTAIN FROM ALL THE IMPIOUS PRACTICES OF
THE HEATHENS.</head>
<p>LXII. Take heed, therefore, not to join yourselves in your worship with those that perish,
which is the assembly of the Gentiles, to your deceit and destruction. For there is no fellowship
between God and the devil; for he that assembles himself with those that favour the
things of the devil, will be esteemed one of them, and will inherit a woe. Avoid also indecent
spectacles: I mean the theatres and the pomps of the heathens; their enchantments, observations
of omens, soothsayings, purgations, divinations, observations of birds; their necromancies
and invocations. For it is written: “There is no divination in Jacob, nor soothsaying in
Israel.”731 And again: “Divination is iniquity.”732 And elsewhere: “Ye shall not be soothsayers,
and follow observers of omens, nor diviners, nor dealers with familiar spirits. Ye shall not
preserve alive wizards.”733 Wherefore Jeremiah exhorts, saying: “Walk ye not according to
the ways of the heathen, and be not afraid of the signs of heaven.”734 So that it is the duty
of a believer to avoid the assemblies of the ungodly, of the heathen, and of the Jews, and of
the rest of the heretics, lest by uniting ourselves to them we bring snares upon our own
souls; that we may not by joining in their feasts, which are celebrated in honour of demons,
be partakers with them in their impiety. You are also to avoid their public meetings, and
those sports which are celebrated in them. For a believer ought not to go to any of those
public meetings, unless to purchase a slave, and save a soul,735 and at the same time to buy
such other things as suit their necessities. Abstain, therefore, from all idolatrous pomp and
state, all their public meetings, banquets, duels, and all shows belonging to demons.</p>

<head>THAT A CHRISTIAN WHO WILL NOT WORK MUST NOT EAT, AS PETER AND
THE REST OF THE APOSTLES WERE FISHERMEN, BUT PAUL AND AQUILA

<p>LXIII. Let the young persons of the Church endeavour to minister diligently in all necessaries:
mind your business with all becoming seriousness, that so you may always have
sufficient to support yourselves and those that are needy, and not burden the Church of
God. For we ourselves, besides our attention to the word of the Gospel, do not neglect our
inferior employments. For some of us are fishermen, some tentmakers, some husbandmen,
that so we may never be idle. So says Solomon somewhere: “Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
consider her ways diligently, and become wiser than she. For she, having neither field,
overseer, nor ruler, prepareth her food in the summer, and layeth up a great store in the
harvest. Or else go to the bee, and learn how laborious she is, and her work how valuable it
is, whose labours both kings and mean men make use of for their health. She is desirable
and glorious, though she be weak in strength, yet by honouring wisdom she is improved,
etc. How long wilt thou lie on thy bed, O sluggard? When wilt thou wake out of thy sleep?
Thou sleepest awhile thou liest down awhile, thou slumberest awhile, thou foldest thy hands
on thy breast to sleep awhile. Then poverty comes on thee like an evil traveller, and want
as a swift racer. But if thou beest diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want
shall fly from thee as an evil runagate.”736 And again: “He that manageth his own land shall
be filled with bread.”737 And elsewhere he says: “The slothful has folded his own hands together,
and has eaten his own flesh.”738 And afterwards: “The sluggard hides his hand; he
will not be able to bring it to his mouth.”739 And again: “By slothfulness of the hands a floor
will be brought low.”740 Labour therefore continually; for the blot of the slothful is not to
be healed. But “if any one does not work, let not such a one eat”741 among you. For the Lord
our God hates the slothful. For no one of those who are dedicated to God ought to be idle.</p>

<head>ELUCIDATION.</head>
<p>(To purchase a slave, and save a soul, p. 424.)</p>
<p>The calm and patient course of the Church in gradually obliterating slavery has been
well defended by the pious Spanish Ultramontane writer Jacques Balmès.742 Of course, he
imagines that “the Catholic Church,” which wrought the change, was his own Tridentine
Communion,743 Lecky’s remarks on the gladiators and slavery as the product of famines
and distress are worthy of note, and even he is forced to recognise the ameliorating influences
of Christianity from the beginning.744 He says:—</p>
<p>“Christianity for the first time made charity a rudimentary virtue, giving it a foremost
place in the moral type and in the exhortations of its teachers. Besides its general influence
in stimulating the affections, it effected a complete revolution in this sphere, by representing
the poor as the special representatives of the Christian founder, and thus making the love
of Christ rather than the love of man the principle of charity. Even in the days of persecution,
collections for the relief of the poor were made at the Sunday meetings. The agapæ, or feasts
of love, were intended mainly for the poor; and food that was saved by the fasts was devoted
to their benefit. A vast organization of charity, presided over by the bishops, and actively
directed by the deacons, soon ramified over Christendom, till the bond of charity became
the bond of unity, and the most distant sections of the Christian Church corresponded by
the interchange of mercy.745 Long before the era of Constantine it was observed that the
charities of the Christians were so extensive—it may perhaps be said so excessive—that they
drew very many impostors to the Church; and, when the victory of Christianity was achieved,
the enthusiasm for charity displayed itself in the erection of numerous institutions that were
altogether unknown to the pagan world.”</p>

<head>SEC. I.—CONCERNING WIDOWS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>THE AGE AT WHICH WIDOWS SHOULD BE CHOSEN.</head>
<p>I. Choose your “widows not under sixty years of age,”746 that in some measure the
suspicion of a second marriage may be prevented by their age. But if you admit one
younger into the order of widows, and she cannot bear her widowhood in her youth, and
marries, she will procure indecent reflections on the glory of the order of the widows, and
shall give an account to God; not because she married a second time, but because she has
“waxed wanton against Christ,”747 and not kept her promise, because she did not come and
keep her promise with faith and the fear of God.748 Wherefore such a promise ought not to
be rashly made, but with great caution: “for it is better for her not to vow, than to vow and
not to pay.”749 But if any younger woman, who has lived but a while with her husband, and
has lost him by death or some other occasion, and remains by herself, having the gift of
widowhood, she will be found to be blessed, and to be like the widow of Sarepta, belonging
to Sidon, with whom the holy prophet of God, Elijah,750 lodged. Such a one may also be
compared to “Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, which departed not from
the temple, but continued in supplications and prayers night and day, who was fourscore
years old, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity, who glorified the
coming of Christ, and gave thanks to the Lord, and spake concerning Him to all those who
looked for redemption in Israel.”751 Such a widow will have a good report, and will be
honoured, having both glory with men upon earth, and eternal praise with God in heaven.</p>

<head>THAT WE MUST AVOID THE CHOICE OF YOUNGER WIDOWS, BECAUSE OF SUSPICION.</head>
<p>II. But let not the younger widows be placed in the order of widows, lest, under pretence
of inability to contain in the flower of their age, they come to a second marriage, and become
subject to imputation. But let them be assisted and supported, that so they may not, under
pretence of being deserted, come to a second marriage, and so be ensnared in an unseemly
imputation. For you ought to know this, that once marrying according to the law is righteous,
as being according to the will of God; but second marriages, after the promise, are wicked,
not on account of the marriage itself, but because of the falsehood. Third marriages are indications
of incontinency. But such marriages as are beyond the third are manifest fornica-

tion, and unquestionable uncleanness. For God in the creation gave one woman to one man;
for “they two shall be one flesh.”752 But to the younger women let a second marriage be allowed
after the death of their first husband, lest they fall into the condemnation of the devil,
and many snares, and foolish lusts, which are hurtful to souls, and which bring upon them
punishment rather than rest.</p>

<head>WHAT CHARACTER THE WIDOWS OUGHT TO BE OF, AND HOW THEY OUGHT TO BE SUPPORTED
BY THE BISHOP.</head>
<p>III. But the true widows are those which have had only one husband, having a good report
among the generality for good works; widows indeed, sober, chaste, faithful, pious, who
have brought up their children well, and have entertained strangers unblameably, which
are to be supported as devoted to God. Besides, do thou, O bishop, be mindful of the needy,
both reaching out thy helping hand and making provision for them as the steward of God,
distributing seasonably the oblations to every one of them, to the widows, the orphans, the
friendless, and those tried with affliction.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<head>THAT WE OUGHT TO BE CHARITABLE TO ALL SORTS OF PERSONS IN WANT.</head>
<p>IV. For what if some are neither widows nor widowers, but stand in need of assistance,
either through poverty or some disease, or the maintenance of a great number of children?
It is thy duty to oversee all people, and to take care of them all. For they that give gifts do
not of their own head give them to the widows, but barely bring them in, calling them freewill
offerings, that so thou that knowest those that are in affliction mayest as a good steward
give them their portion of the gift. For God knows the giver, though thou distributest it to
those in want when he is absent. And he has the reward of well-doing, but thou the
blessedness of having dispensed it with a good conscience. But do thou tell them who was
the giver, that they may pray for him by name. For it is our duty to do good to all men, not
fondly preferring one or another, whoever they be. For the Lord says: “Give to every one
that asketh of thee.”753 It is evident that it is meant of every one that is really in want,
whether he be friend or foe, whether he be a kinsman or a stranger, whether he be single or
married. For in all the Scripture the Lord gives us exhortations about the needy, saying first
by Isaiah: “Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor which have no covering into
thine house. If thou seest the naked, do thou cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those
which are of thine own family and seed.”754 And then by Daniel He says to the potentate:
“Wherefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and purge thy sins by acts of mercy, and
thine iniquities by bowels of compassion to the needy.”755 And He says by Solomon: “By
<note type="footnote">752 Gen. ii. 24.</note>

<note type="footnote">755 Dan. iv. 27</note>

<pb n="951"/>
acts of mercy and of faith iniquities are purged.”756 And He says again by David: “Blessed
is he that has regard to the poor and needy; the Lord shall deliver him in the evil day.”757
And again: “He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the needy, his righteousness remaineth
for ever.”758 And Solomon says: “He that hath mercy on the poor lendeth to the
Lord;759 according to his gift it shall be repaid him again.”760 And afterwards: “He that
stoppeth his ear, that he may not hear him that is in want, he also shall call himself, and
there shall be none to hear him.”761</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<head>THAT THE WIDOWS ARE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF THEIR BEHAVIOR.</head>
<p>V. Let every widow be meek, quiet, gentle, sincere, free from anger, not talkative, not
clamorous, not hasty of speech, not given to evil-speaking, not captious, not double-tongued,
not a busybody. If she see or hear anything that is not right, let her be as one that does not
see, and as one that does not hear. And let the widow mind nothing but to pray for those
that give, and for the whole Church; and when she is asked anything by any one, let her not
easily answer, excepting questions concerning the faith, and righteousness, and hope in
God, remitting those that desire to be instructed in the doctrines of godliness to the governors.
Let her only answer so as may tend to the subversion of the error of polytheism, and let her
demonstrate the assertion concerning the monarchy of God. But of the remaining doctrines
let her not answer anything rashly, lest by saying anything unlearnedly she should make the
word to be blasphemed. For the Lord has taught us that the word is like “a grain of mustard
seed,”762 which is of a fiery nature, which if any one uses unskilfully, he will find it bitter.
For in the mystical points we ought not to be rash, but cautious; for the Lord exhorts us,
saying: “Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn
again and rend you.”763 For unbelievers, when they hear the doctrine concerning Christ
not explained as it ought to be, but defectively, and especially that concerning His incarnation
or His passion, will rather reject it with scorn, and laugh at it as false, than praise God for
it. And so the aged women will be guilty of rashness, and of causing blasphemy, and will
inherit a woe. For says He, “Woe to him by whom my name is blasphemed among the
Gentiles.”764</p>

<head>THAT WOMEN OUGHT NOT TO TEACH, BECAUSE IT IS UNSEEMLY; AND WHAT WOMEN FOLLOWED
OUR LORD.</head>
<p>VI. We do not permit our “women to teach in the Church,”765 but only to pray and
hear those that teach; for our Master and Lord, Jesus Himself, when He sent us the twelve
to make disciples of the people and of the nations, did nowhere send out women to preach,
although He did not want such. For there were with us the mother of our Lord and His sisters;
also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Martha and Mary the sisters of
Lazarus; Salome, and certain others. For, had it been necessary for women to teach, He
Himself had first commanded these also to instruct the people with us. For “if the head of
the wife be the man,”766 it is not reasonable that the rest of the body should govern the head.
Let the widow therefore own herself to be the “altar of God,” and let her sit in her house,
and not enter into the houses of the faithful, under any pretence, to receive anything; for
the altar of God never runs about, but is fixed in one place. Let, therefore, the virgin and
the widow be such as do not run about, or gad to the houses of those who are alien from
the faith. For such as these are gadders and impudent: they do not make their feet to rest in
one place, because they are not widows, but purses ready to receive, triflers, evil-speakers,
counsellors of strife, without shame, impudent, who being such, are not worthy of Him that
called them. For they do not come to the common station of the congregation on the Lord’s
day,767 as those that are watchful; but either they slumber, or trifle, or allure men, or beg,
or ensnare others, bringing them to the evil one; not suffering them to be watchful in the
Lord, but taking care that they go out as vain as they came in, because they do not hear the
word of the Lord either taught or read. For of such as these the prophet Isaiah says: “Hearing
ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the
heart of this people is waxen gross,768 and they hear heavily with their ears.”769</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<head>WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERS OF WIDOWS FALSELY SO CALLED.</head>
<p>VII. In the same manner, therefore, the ears of the hearts of such widows as these are
stopped, that they will not sit within in their cottages to speak to the Lord, but will run about
with the design of getting, and by their foolish prattling fulfil the desires of the adversary.
Such widows, therefore, are not affixed to the altar of Christ: for there are some widows
which esteem gain their business; and since they ask without shame, and receive without
being satisfied, render the generality more backward in giving. For when they ought to be
content with their subsistence from the Church, as having moderate desires, on the contrary,

<pb n="953"/>
they run from one of their neighbours’ houses770 to another, and disturb them, heaping up
to themselves plenty of money, and lend at bitter usury, and are only solicitous about
mammon, whose bag is their god; who prefer eating and drinking before all virtue, saying,
“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die;”771 who esteem these things as if they were
durable and not perishing things. For she that uses herself to nothing but talking of money,
worships mammon instead of God,—that is, is a servant to gain, but cannot be pleasing to
God, nor resigned to His worship; not being able to intercede with Him continuously on
account that her mind and disposition run after money: for “where the treasure is, there
will the heart be also.”772 For she is thinking in her mind whither she may go to receive, or
that a certain woman her friend has forgot her, and she has somewhat to say to her. She that
thinks of such things as these will no longer attend to her prayers, but to that thought which
offers itself; so that though sometimes she would pray for anybody, she will not be heard,
because she does not offer her petition to the Lord with her whole heart, but with a divided
mind. But she that will attend to God will sit within, and mind the things of the Lord day
and night, offering her sincere petition with a mouth ready to utter the same without ceasing.
As therefore Judith, most famous for her wisdom, and of a good report for her modesty,
“prayed to God night and day for Israel;”773 so also the widow who is like to her will offer
her intercession without ceasing for the Church to God. And He will hear her, because her
mind is fixed on this thing alone, and is not disposed to be either insatiable, or covetous, or
expensive; when her eye is pure, and her hearing clean, and her hands undefiled, and her
feet quiet, and her mouth prepared for neither gluttony nor trifling, but speaking the things
that are fit, and partaking of only such things as are necessary for her maintenance. So, being
grave, and giving no disturbance, she will be pleasing to God; and as soon as she asks anything,
the gift will come to her: as He says, “While thou art speaking, I will say, Behold, I
am here.”774 Let such a one also be free from the love of money, free from arrogance, not
given to filthy lucre, not insatiable, not gluttonous, but continent, meek, giving nobody
disturbance, pious, modest, sitting at home, singing, and praying, and reading, and watching,
and fasting; speaking to God continually in songs and hymns. And let her take wool, and
rather assist others than herself want from them; being mindful of that widow who is honoured
in the Gospel with the Lord’s testimony, who, coming into the temple, “cast into the
treasury two mites, which make a farthing. And Christ our Lord and Master, and Searcher
of hearts, saw her, and said, Verily I say unto you, that this widow hath cast into the treasury

more than they all: for all they have cast in of their abundance, but this woman of her penury
hath cast in all the living that she had.”775</p>
<p>The widows therefore ought to be grave, obedient to their bishops, and their presbyters,
and their deacons, and besides these to the deaconesses, with piety, reverence, and fear; not
usurping authority, nor desiring to do anything beyond the constitution without the consent
of the deacon: as, suppose, the going to any one to eat or drink with him, or to receive anything
from anybody. But if without direction she does any one of these things, let her be
punished with fasting, or else let her be separated on account of her rashness.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<head>THAT THE WIDOWS OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT OF ALMS FROM THE UNWORTHY NO MORE THAN
THE BISHOP, OR ANY OTHER OF THE FAITHFUL.</head>
<p>VIII. For how does such a one know of what character the person is from whom she
receives? or from what sort of ministration he supplies her with food, whether it does not
arise from rapine or some other ill course of life? while the widow does not remember that
if she receives in a way unworthy of God, she must give an account for every one of these
things. For neither will the priests at any time receive a free-will offering from such a one,
as, suppose, from a rapacious person or from a harlot. For it is written, “Thou shalt not
covet the goods that are thy neighbour’s;”776 and, “Thou shalt not offer the hire of an harlot
to the Lord God.”777 From such as these no offerings ought to be accepted, nor indeed from
those that are separated from the Church. Let the widows also be ready to obey the commands
given them by their superiors, and let them do according to the appointment of the bishop,
being obedient to him as to God; for he that receives from such a one who is worthy of
blame, or from one excommunicated, and prays for him, while he purposes to go on in a
wicked course, and while he is not willing at any time to repent, holds communion with
him in prayer, and grieves Christ, who rejects the unrighteous, and confirms them by means
of the unworthy gift, and is defiled with them, not suffering them to come to repentance,
so as to fall down before God with lamentation, and pray to Him.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<head>THAT WOMEN OUGHT NOT TO BAPTIZE, BECAUSE IT IS IMPIOUS, AND CONTRARY TO THE
DOCTRINE OF CHRIST.</head>
<p>IX. Now, as to women’s baptizing, we let you know that there is no small peril to those
that undertake it. Therefore we do not advise you to it; for it is dangerous, or rather wicked
and impious. For if the “man be the head of the woman,”778 and he be originally ordained
for the priesthood, it is not just to abrogate the order of the creation, and leave the principal
to come to the extreme part of the body. For the woman is the body of the man, taken from

his side, and subject to him, from whom she was separated for the procreation of children.
For says He, “He shall rule over thee.”779 For the principal part of the woman is the man,
as being her head. But if in the foregoing constitutions we have not permitted them to teach,
how will any one allow them, contrary to nature, to perform the office of a priest? For this
is one of the ignorant practices of the Gentile atheism, to ordain women priests to the female
deities, not one of the constitutions of Christ. For if baptism were to be administered by
women, certainly our Lord would have been baptized by His own mother, and not by John;
or when He sent us to baptize, He would have sent along with us women also for this purpose.
But now He has nowhere, either by constitution or by writing, delivered to us any such
thing; as knowing the order of nature, and the decency of the action;780 as being the Creator
of nature, and the Legislator of the constitution.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<head>THAT A LAYMAN OUGHT NOT TO DO ANY OFFICE OF THE PRIESTHOOD: HE OUGHT NEITHER TO
BAPTIZE, NOR OFFER, NOR LAY ON HANDS, NOR GIVE THE BLESSING.</head>
<p>X. Neither do we permit the laity to perform any of the offices belonging to the priesthood;
as, for instance, neither the sacrifice, nor baptism, nor the laying on of hands, nor the
blessing, whether the smaller or the greater: for “no one taketh this honour to himself, but
he that is called of God.”781 For such sacred offices are conferred by the laying on of the
hands of the bishop. But a person to whom such an office is not committed, but he seizes
upon it for himself, he shall undergo the punishment of Uzziah.782</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<head>THAT NONE BUT A BISHOP AND PRESBYTER, NONE EVEN OF THE INFERIOR RANKS OF THE CLERGY,
ARE PERMITTED TO DO THE OFFICES OF THE PRIESTS; THAT ORDINATION BELONGS WHOLLY TO
THE BISHOP, AND TO NOBODY ELSE.</head>
<p>XI. Nay, further, we do not permit to the rest of the clergy to baptize,—as, for instance,
neither to readers, nor singers, nor porters, nor ministers,—but to the bishops and presbyters
alone, yet so that the deacons are to minister to them therein. But those who venture upon
it shall undergo the punishment of the companions of Corah.783 We do not permit presbyters
to ordain deacons, or deaconesses, or readers, or ministers, or singers, or porters, but only
bishops; for this is the ecclesiastical order and harmony.</p>

and full of various devices, he goes to those that are not truly widows, as formerly to Cain
(for some say they are widows, but do not perform the injunctions agreeable to the widowhood;
as neither did Cain discharge the duties due to a brother: for they do not consider
how it is not the name of widowhood that will bring them to the kingdom of God, but true
faith and holy784 works). But if any one possesses the name of widowhood, but does the
works of the adversary, her widowhood will not be imputed, but she will be thrust out of
the kingdom, and delivered to eternal punishment. For we hear that some widows are jealous,
envious calumniators, and envious at the quiet of others. Such widows as these are not the
disciples of Christ, nor of His doctrine; for it becomes them, when one of their fellow-widows
is clothed by any one, or receives money, or meat, or drink, or shoes, at the sight of the refreshment
of their sister to say:—</p>

to Thee, and remember him for good in the day of his visitation. And as for my bishop, who
has so well performed his duty to Thee, and785 has ordered such a seasonable alms to be bestowed
on my fellow-widow, who was naked, do Thou increase his glory, and give him a786

seeth in secret, will render to him that did good openly.” But those widows which will not
live according to the command of God, are solicitous and inquisitive what deaconess it is
that gives the charity, and what widows receive it. And when she has learned those things,
she murmurs at the deaconess who distributed the charity, saying, Dost not thou see that I

of man, but the appointment of God. For if she is herself a witness that she was nearer, and,
upon inquiry, was in greater want, and more naked than the other, she ought to understand
who it is that made this constitution, and to hold her peace, and not to murmur at the deaconess
who distributed the charity, but to enter into her own house, and to cast herself
prostrate on her face to make supplication to God that her sin may be forgiven her. For God
commanded the deaconess who brought the charity not to proclaim the same, and this
widow murmured because she did not publish her name, that so she might know it, and
run to receive; nay, did not only murmur, but also cursed her, forgetting Him that said: “He
that blesseth thee is blessed, and he that curseth thee is cursed.”789 But the Lord says: “When
ye enter into an house, say, Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your
peace shall rest upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.”790</p>

return upon the head of him that unjustly sent it, because he to whom it was sent was not
worthy to receive it: for all those who abuse others without a cause curse themselves, as
Solomon says: “As birds and sparrows fly away, so the curse causeless shall not come upon
any one.”791 And again he says: “Those that bring reproaches are exceeding foolish.”792 But
as the bee, a creature as to its strength feeble, if she stings any one, loses her sting, and becomes
a drone; in the same manner you also, whatsoever injustice you do to others, will
bring it upon yourselves. “He hath graven and digged a pit, and he shall fall into the same
ditch that he has made.”793 And again: “He that diggeth a pit for his neighbour, shall fall
into it.”794 Wherefore he that avoids a curse, let him not curse another; for “what thou hatest
should be done to thee, do not thou to another.”795 Wherefore admonish the widows that
are feeble-minded, strengthen those of them that are weak, and praise such of them as walk
in holiness. Let them rather bless, and not calumniate. Let them make peace, and not stir
up contention.</p>

<head>SEC. II.—ON DEACONS AND DEACONESSES, THE REST OF THE CLERGY, AND
ON BAPTISM.</head>
<p>Let not therefore either a bishop, or a presbyter, or a deacon, or any one else of the sacerdotal
catalogue, defile his tongue with calumny, lest he inherit a curse instead of a blessing;
and let it also be the bishop’s business and care that no lay person utter any curse: for he
ought to take care of all,—of the clergy, of the virgins, of the widows, of the laity. For which
reason, O bishop, do thou ordain thy fellow-workers, the labourers for life and for righteousness,
such deacons as are pleasing to God, such whom thou provest to be worthy among all
the people, and such as shall be ready for the necessities of their ministration. Ordain also
a deaconess who is faithful and holy, for the ministrations towards women. For sometimes
he cannot send a deacon, who is a man, to the women, on account of unbelievers. Thou
shalt therefore send a woman, a deaconess, on account of the imaginations of the bad. For
we stand in need of a woman, a deaconess, for many necessities; and first in the baptism of
women, the deacon shall anoint only their forehead with the holy oil, and after him the
deaconess shall anoint them:796 for there is no necessity that the women should be seen by
the men; but only in the laying on of hands the bishop shall anoint her head, as the priests
and kings were formerly anointed, not because those which are now baptized are ordained
priests, but as being Christians, or anointed, from Christ the Anointed, “a royal priesthood,
and an holy nation, the Church of God, the pillar and ground of the marriage-chamber,”797
who formerly were not a people, but now are beloved and chosen, upon whom is called His
new name798 as Isaiah the prophet witnesses, saying: “And they shall call the people by His
new name, which the Lord shall name for them.”799</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>CONCERNING THE SACRED INITIATION OF HOLY BAPTISM.</head>
<p>XVI. Thou therefore, O bishop, according to that type, shalt anoint the head of those
that are to be baptized, whether they be men or women, with the holy oil, for a type of the
spiritual baptism. After that, either thou, O bishop, or a presbyter that is under thee, shall
in the solemn form name over them the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, and shall dip them
in the water; and let a deacon receive the man, and a deaconess the woman, that so the
conferring of this inviolable seal may take place with a becoming decency. And after that,
let the bishop anoint those that are baptized with ointment.</p>

<head>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BAPTISM INTO CHRIST, AND ON WHAT ACCOUNT EVERYTHING IS

<p>XVII. This baptism, therefore, is given into the death of Jesus:800 the water is instead
of the burial, and the oil instead of the Holy Ghost; the seal instead of the cross; the ointment
is the confirmation of the confession; the mention of the Father as of the Author and Sender;
the joint mention of the Holy Ghost as of the witness; the descent into the water the dying
together with Christ; the ascent out of the water the rising again with Him. The Father is
the God over all; Christ is the only-begotten God, the beloved Son, the Lord of glory; the
Holy Ghost is the Comforter, who is sent by Christ, land taught by Him, and proclaims
Him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>OF WHAT CHARACTER HE OUGHT TO BE WHO IS INITIATED.</head>
<p>XVIII. But let him that is to be baptized be free from all iniquity; one that has left off to
work sin, the friend of God, the enemy of the devil, the heir of God the Father, the fellowheir
of His Son; one that has renounced Satan, and the demons, and Satan’s deceits; chaste,
pure, holy, beloved of God, the son of God, praying as a son to his father, and saying, as
from the common congregation of the faithful, thus: “Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven;
give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: for Thine is the kingdom, and
the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.”801</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<head>WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERS OF A DEACON.</head>
<p>XIX. Let the deacons be in all things unspotted, as the bishop himself is to be, only more
active; in number according to the largeness of the Church, that they may minister to the
infirm as workmen that are not ashamed. And let the deaconess be diligent in taking care
of the women; but both of them ready to carry messages, to travel about, to minister, and
to serve, as spake Isaiah concerning the Lord, saying: “To justify the righteous, who serves
many faithfully.”802 Let every one therefore know his proper place, and discharge it diligently
with one consent, with one mind, as knowing the reward of their ministration; but let them
not be ashamed to minister to those that are in want, as even our “Lord Jesus Christ came
not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give His life a ransom for many.”803 So
therefore ought they also to do, and not to scruple it, if they should be obliged to lay down
their life for a brother. For the Lord and our Saviour Jesus Christ did not scruple to “lay

down His life,” as Himself says, “for His friends.”804 If, therefore, the Lord of heaven and
earth underwent all His sufferings for us, how then do you make a difficulty to minister to
such as are in want, who ought to imitate Him who underwent servitude, and want, and
stripes, and the cross for us? We ought therefore also to serve the brethren, in imitation of
Christ. For says He: “He that will be great among you, let him be your minister; and he that
will be first among you, let him be your servant.”805 For so did He really, and not in word
only, fulfil the prediction of, “serving many faithfully.”806 For “when He had taken a towel,
He girded Himself. Afterward He puts water into a bason; and as we were sitting at meat,
He came and washed the feet of us all, and wiped them with the towel.”807 By doing this He
demonstrated to us His kindness and brotherly affection, that so we also might do the same
to one another. If, therefore, our Lord and Master so humbled Himself, how can you, the
labourers of the truth, and administrators of piety, be ashamed to do the same to such of
the brethren as are weak and infirm? Minister therefore with a kind mind, not murmuring
nor mutinying; for ye do not do it on the account of man, but on the account of God, and
shall receive from Him the reward of your ministry in the day of your visitation. It is your
duty who are deacons to visit all those who stand in need of visitation. And tell your bishop
of all those that are in affliction; for you ought to be like his soul and senses—active and
attentive in all things to him808 as to your bishop, and father809 and master.</p>

is not lawful that he be set over you by one; for the testimony of two or three witnesses is
more firm and secure. But a presbyter and a deacon are to be ordained by one bishop and
the rest of the clergy. Nor must either a presbyter or a deacon ordain from the laity into the
clergy; but the presbyter is only to teach, to offer, to baptize, to bless the people, and the
deacon is to minister to the bishop, and to the presbyters, that is, to do the office of a ministering
deacon, but not to meddle with the other offices.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<p>THOSE WHO HAVE NO CHILDREN SHOULD ADOPT ORPHANS, AND TREAT THEM AS THEIR OWN
CHILDREN.</p>
<p>I. When any Christian becomes an orphan, whether it be a young man or a maid, it is
good that some one of the brethren who is without a child should take the young man, and
esteem him in the place of a son; and he that has a son about the same age, and that is marriageable,
should marry the maid to him: for they which do so perform a great work, and
become fathers to the orphans, and shall receive the reward of this charity from the Lord
God. But if any one that walks in the way of man-pleasing is rich, and therefore is ashamed
of orphans, the Father of orphans and Judge of widows will make provision for the orphans,
but himself shall have such an heir as will spend what he has spared; and it shall happen to
him according as it is said: “What things the holy people have not eaten, those shall the
Assyrians eat.” As also Isaiah says: “Your land, strangers devour it in your presence.”810</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<head>HOW THE BISHOP OUGHT TO PROVIDE FOR THE ORPHANS.</head>
<p>II. Do you therefore, O bishops, be solicitous about their maintenance, being in nothing
wanting to them; exhibiting to the orphans the care of parents; to the widows the care of
husbands; to those of suitable age, marriage; to the artificer, work; to the unable, commiseration;
to the strangers, an house; to the hungry, food; to the thirsty, drink; to the naked,
clothing; to the sick, visitation; to the prisoners, assistance. Besides these, have a greater care
of the orphans, that nothing may be wanting to them; and that as to the maiden, till she arrives
at the age of marriage, and ye give her in marriage to a brother: to the young man assistance,
that he may learn a trade, and may be maintained by the advantage arising from
it; that so, when he is dextrous in the management of it, he may thereby be enabled to buy
himself the tools of his trade, that so he may no longer burden any of the brethren, or their
sincere love to him, but may support himself: for certainly he is a happy man who is able to
support himself, and does not take up the place of the orphan, the stranger, and the widow.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>WHO OUGHT TO BE SUPPORTED ACCORDING TO THE LORD’S CONSTITUTION.</head>
<p>III. Since even the Lord said: “The giver was happier than the receiver.”811 For it is again
said by Him: “Woe to those that have, and receive in hypocrisy; or who are able to support
themselves, yet will receive of others: for both of them shall give an account to the Lord God
in the day of judgment.” But an orphan who, by reason of his youth, or he that by the
feebleness of old age, or the incidence of a disease, or the bringing up of many children, receives
alms, such a one shall not only not be blamed, but shall be commended: for he shall

be esteemed an altar to God, and be honoured by God, because of his zealous and constant
prayers for those that give to him; not receiving idly, but to the uttermost of his power recompensing
what is given him by his prayer. Such a one therefore shall be blessed by God
in eternal life. But he that hath, and receives in hypocrisy or through idleness, instead of
working and assisting others, shall be obnoxious to punishment before God, because he has
snatched away the morsel of the needy.812</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">    
<head>OF THE LOVE OF MONEY.</head>
<p>IV. For he that has money and does not bestow it upon others, nor use it himself, is like
the serpent, which they say sleeps over the treasures; and of him is that scripture true which
says, “He has gathered riches of which he shall not taste;”813 and they will be of no use to
him when he perishes justly. For it says, “Riches will not profit in the day of wrath.” For
such a one has not believed in God, but in his own gold; esteeming that his God, and trusting
therein. Such a one is a dissembler of the truth, an accepter of persons, unfaithful, cheating,
fearful, unmanly, light, of no value, a complainer, ever in pain, his own enemy, and nobody’s
friend. Such a one’s money shall perish, and a man that is a stranger shall consume it, either
by theft while he is alive, or by inheritance when he is dead. “For riches unjustly gotten shall
be vomited up.”814</p>

<p>WITH WHAT FEAR MEN OUGHT TO PARTAKE OF THE LORD’S OBLATIONS.</p>
<p>V. We exhort, therefore, the widows and orphans to partake of those things that are
bestowed upon them with all fear, and all pious reverence, and to return thanks to God who
gives food to the needy, and to lift up their eyes to Him. For, says He, “Which of you shall
eat, or who shall drink without Him? For He openeth His hand, and filleth every living thing
with His kindness: giving wheat to the young men, and wine to the maidens, and oil for the
joy of the living, grass for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, flesh for the wild
beasts, seeds for the birds, and suitable food for all creatures.”815 Wherefore the Lord says:816
“Consider the fowls of heaven,817 that they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into
barns, and your Father feedeth them. Are not ye much better than they? Be not therefore
solicitous, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? For your Father knoweth that

<head>WHOSE OBLATIONS ARE TO BE RECEIVED, AND WHOSE NOT TO BE RECEIVED.</head>
<p>VI. Now the bishop ought to know whose oblations he ought to receive, and whose he
ought not. For he is to avoid corrupt dealers, and not receive their gifts. “For, a corrupt
dealer shall not be justified from sin.”820 For of them it was that Isaiah reproached Israel,
and said, “Thy corrupt dealers mingle wine with water.”821 He is also to avoid fornicators,
for “thou shall not offer the hire of an harlot to the Lord.”822 He is also to avoid extortioners,
and such as covet other men’s goods, and adulterers; for the sacrifices of such as these are
abominable with God. Also those that oppress the widow and overbear the orphan, and fill
prisons with the innocent, and abuse their own servants wickedly, I mean with stripes, and
hunger, and hard service, nay, destroy whole cities; do thou, O bishop, avoid such as these,
and their odious oblations. Thou shalt also refuse rogues, and such pleaders that plead on
the side of injustice, and idol-makers, and thieves, and unjust publicans, and those that deceive
by false balances and deceitful measures, and a soldier who is a false accuser and not
content with his wages, but does violence to the needy, a murderer, a cut-throat, and an
unjust judge, a subverter of causes, him that lies in wait for men, a worker of abominable
wickedness, a drunkard, a blasphemer, a sodomite, an usurer, and every one that is wicked
and opposes the will of God. For the Scripture says that all such as these are abominable
with God. For those that receive from such persons, and thereby support the widows and
orphans, shall be obnoxious to the judgment-seat of God; as Adonias the prophet, in the
book of Kings, when he disobeyed God, and both “eat bread and drank water in the place
which the Lord had forbid him,”823 because of the impiety of Jeroboam, was slain by a lion.
For the bread which is distributed to the widows from labour is better, though it be short
and little, than that from injustice and false accusation, though it be much and fine. For the
Scripture says: “Better is a little to the righteous, than much riches of the sinners.”824 Now,
although a widow, who eats and is filled from the impious, pray for them, she shall not be

<p>VII. And not these only, but those that are in sin and have not repented, will not only
not be heard when they pray, but will provoke God to anger, as putting Him in mind of
their own wickedness. Avoid therefore such ministrations, as you would the price of a dog
and the hire of an harlot; for both of them are forbidden by the laws. For neither did Elisha
receive the presents which were brought by Hazael,827 nor Ahijah those from Jeroboam;828
but if the prophets of God did not admit of presents from the impious, it is reasonable, O
bishops, that neither should you. Nay, when Simon the magician offered money to me Peter
and John,829 and tried to obtain the invaluable grace by purchase, we did not admit it, but
bound him with everlasting maledictions, because he thought to possess the gift of God,
not by a pious mind towards God, but by the price of money. Avoid therefore such oblations
to God’s altar as are not from a good conscience. For says He: “Abstain from all injustice,
and thou shalt not fear, and trembling shall not come nigh thee.”830</p>

FROM THE UNGODLY.</head>
<p>VIII. But if ye say that those who give alms are such as these, and if we do not receive

the people be maintained? Ye shall hear from us, that therefore have ye received the gift of
the Levites, the oblations of your people, that ye might have enough for yourselves, and for
those that are in want; and that ye might not be so straitened as to receive from the wicked.
But if the churches be so straitened, it is better to perish than to receive anything from the
enemies of God, to the reproach and abuse of His friends. For of such as these the prophet
speaks: “Let not the oil of a sinner moisten my head.”831 Do ye therefore examine such

Therefore maintain and clothe those that are in want from the righteous labour of the

to be laid out in the redemption of the saints, the deliverance of slaves, and of captives, and

are not evil in their nature, but on account of the mind of those that bring them. And this

<head>OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN.</head>
<p>XI. Ye fathers, educate your children in the Lord, bringing them up in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord; and teach them such trades as are agreeable and suitable to the
word, lest they by such opportunity become extravagant, and continue without punishment
from their parents, and so get relaxation before their time, and go astray from that which
is good. Wherefore be not afraid to reprove them, and to teach them wisdom with severity.
For your corrections will not kill them, but rather preserve them. As Solomon says somewhere
in the book of Wisdom: “Chasten thy son, and he will refresh thee; so wilt thou have good
hope of him. Thou verily shalt smite him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from
death.”835 And again, says the same Solomon thus, “He that spareth his rod, hateth his
son;”836 and afterwards, “Beat his sides whilst he is an infant, lest he be hardened and disobey
thee.”837 He, therefore, that neglects to admonish and instruct his own son, hates his own
child. Do you therefore teach your children the word of the Lord. Bring them under with
cutting stripes, and make them subject from their infancy, teaching them the Holy Scriptures,
which are Christian and divine, and delivering to them every sacred writing, “not giving
them such liberty that they get the mastery,”838 and act against your opinion, not permitting
them to club together for a treat with their equals. For so they will be turned to disorderly
courses, and will fall into fornication; and if this happen by the carelessness of their parents,
those that begat them will be guilty of their souls. For if the offending children get into the
company of debauched persons by the negligence of those that begat them, they will not be
punished alone by themselves; but their parents also will be condemned on their account.
For this cause endeavour, at the time when they are of an age fit for marriage, to join them
in wedlock, and settle them together, lest in the heat and fervour of their age their course
of life become dissolute, and you be required to give an account by the Lord God in the day
of judgment.</p>

his master, with the fear of God, although he be impious and wicked,839 but yet not to yield
any compliance as to his worship? And let the master love his servant, although he be his

but still with the preservation of his authority as his master: “not as an eye-servant, but as

In like manner, let a master who has a believing servant love him as a son or as a brother,
on account of their communion in the faith, but still preserving the difference of a servant.</p>

<head>OF VIRGINS.</head>
<p>XIV. Concerning virginity we have received no commandment;845 but we leave it to
the power of those that are willing, as a vow: exhorting them so far in this matter that they
do not promise anything rashly; since Solomon says, “It is better not to vow, than to vow
and not pay.”846 Let such a virgin, therefore, be holy in body and soul, as the temple of
God,847 as the house of Christ, as the habitation of the Holy Spirit. For she that vows ought
to do such works as are suitable to her vow; and to show that her vow is real, and made on
account of leisure for piety, not to cast a reproach on marriage. Let her not be a gadder
abroad, nor one that rambles about unseasonably; not double-minded, but grave, continent,
sober, pure, avoiding the conversation of many, and especially of those that are of ill reputation.

<head>SEC. I.—CONCERNING THE MARTYRS.</head>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<head>THAT IT IS REASONABLE FOR THE FAITHFUL TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF THOSE WHO ARE
AFFLICTED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST BY THE UNBELIEVERS, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE LORD.</head>
<p>I. If any Christian, on account of the name of Christ, and love and faith towards God,
be condemned by the ungodly to the games, to the beasts, or to the mines, do not ye overlook
him; but send to him from your labour and your very sweat for his sustenance, and for a
reward to the soldiers, that he may be eased and be taken care of; that, as far as lies in your
power, your blessed brother may not be afflicted: for he that is condemned for the name of
the Lord God is an holy martyr, a brother of the Lord, the son of the Highest, a receptacle
of the Holy Spirit, by whom every one of the faithful has received the illumination of the
glory of the holy Gospel, by being vouchsafed the incorruptible crown, and the testimony
of Christ’s sufferings, and the fellowship of His blood, to be made conformable to the death
of Christ for the adoption of children. For this cause do you, all ye of the faithful, by your
bishop, minister to the saints of your substance and of your labour. But if any one has not,
let him fast a day, and set apart that, and order it for the saints. But if any one has superfluities,
let him minister more to them according to the proportion of his ability. But if he can
possibly sell all his livelihood, and redeem them out of prison, he will be blessed, and a friend
of Christ. For if he that gives his goods to the poor be perfect, supposing his knowledge of
divine things, much more is he so that does it on account of the martyrs. For such a one is
worthy of God, and will fulfil His will by supplying those who have confessed Him before
nations and kings, and the children of Israel; concerning whom our Lord declared, saying:
“Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father.”849 And
if these be such as to be attested to by Christ before His Father, you ought not to be ashamed
to go to them in the prisons. For if you do this, it will be esteemed to you for a testimony,
because the real trial was to them a testimony; and your readiness will be so to you, as being
partakers of their combat: for the Lord speaks somewhere to such as these, saying: “Come,
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was
a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was
in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer, and say, Lord, when saw
we Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink? When saw we Thee
naked, and clothed Thee? or sick, and visited Thee? When saw we Thee a stranger, and took
Thee in? or in prison, and came unto Thee? And He will answer and say unto them, Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. And
these shall go away into life everlasting. Then shall He say unto them on His left hand, Depart

hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a stranger,
and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me
not. Then shall they also answer and say, Lord when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or a
stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then shall He
answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it unto one
of the least of these, neither have ye done it unto me. And these shall go away unto everlasting
punishment.”850</p>

<p>II. But if any one who calls himself a brother is seduced by the evil one, and acts
wickedness, and is convicted and condemned to death as an adulterer, or a murderer, depart
from him, that ye may be secure, and none of you may be suspected as a partner in such an
abominable practice; and that no evil report may be spread abroad, as if all Christians took
a pleasure in unlawful actions. Wherefore keep far from them. But do you assist with all
diligence those that for the sake of Christ are abused by the ungodly and shut up in prison,
or who are given over to death, or bonds, or banishment, in order to deliver your fellowmembers
from wicked hands. And if any one who accompanies with them is caught, and
falls into misfortune, he is blessed, because he is partaker with the martyr, and is one that
imitates the sufferings of Christ; for we ourselves also, when we oftentimes received stripes
from Caiaphas, and Alexander, and Annas, for Christ’s sake, “went out rejoicing that we
were counted worthy to suffer such things for our Saviour.”851 Do you also rejoice when ye
suffer such things, for ye shall be blessed in that day.852</p>

city to city”853 on account of the Lord’s commandment; and assist them as martyrs, rejoicing
that ye are made partakers of their persecution, as knowing that they are esteemed blessed
by the Lord; for Himself says: “Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute

afterwards: “If they persecute you in this city, flee ye to another. For in the world ye have
tribulation: for they shall deliver you into the synagogues; and ye shall be brought before
rulers and kings for my sake, and for a testimony to them.”856 And, “He that endureth unto
the end, the same shall be saved.”857 For he that is persecuted for the sake of the faith, and
bears witness in regard to Him, Christ, and endures, is truly a man of God.</p>

<head>THAT IT IS AN HORRIBLE AND DESTRUCTIVE THING TO DENY CHRIST.</head>
<p>IV. But he that denies himself to be a Christian, that he may not be hated of men, and
so loves his own life more than he does the Lord, in whose hand his breath is, is wretched
and miserable, as being detestable and abominable, who desires to be the friend of men, but
is the enemy of God, having no longer his portion with the saints, but with those that are
accursed; choosing instead of the kingdom of the blessed, that eternal fire which is prepared
for the devil and his angels: not being any longer hated by men, but rejected by God, and
cast out from His presence. For of such a one our Lord declared, saying: “Whosoever shall
deny me before men, and shall be ashamed of my name, I also will deny and be ashamed of
him before my Father which is in heaven.”858 And again He speaks thus to us ourselves,
His disciples: “He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he
that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not his
cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life, shall lose it; and
he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”859
And afterwards: “Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather
fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”860</p>

and suffered not only persecution and stripes, reproach and mockery, but also crucifixion,
that He might save the penitent, both Jews and Gentiles. If therefore He for our sakes re-
nounced His repose, was not ashamed of the cross, and did not esteem death inglorious,
why do not we imitate His sufferings, and renounce on His account even our own life, with
that patience which He gives us? For He did all for our sakes, but we do it for our own sakes:
for He does not stand in need of us, but we stand in need of His mercy. He only requires
the sincerity and readiness of our faith, as the Scripture says: “If thou beest righteous, what
doest thou give to Him? or what will He receive at thy hand? Thy wickedness is to a man
like thyself, and thy righteousness to a son of man.”861</p>

<head>THAT A BELIEVER OUGHT NEITHER RASHLY TO RUN INTO DANGER THROUGH SECURITY, NOR
TO BE OVER-TIMOROUS THROUGH PUSILLANIMITY, BUT TO FLY AWAY FOR FEAR; YET THAT IF
HE DOES FALL INTO THE ENEMY’S HAND, TO STRIVE EARNESTLY, UPON ACCOUNT OF THE CROWN
THAT IS LAID UP FOR HIM.</head>
<p>VI. Let us therefore renounce our parents, and kinsmen, and friends, and wife, and
children, and possessions, and all the enjoyments of life, when any of these things become
an impediment to piety. For we ought to pray that we may not enter into temptation; but
if we be called to martyrdom, with constancy to confess His precious name, and if on this
account we be punished, let us rejoice, as hastening to immortality. When we are persecuted,
let us not think it strange; let us not love the present world, nor the praises which come from
men, nor the glory and honour of rulers, according as some of the Jews wondered at the
mighty works of our Lord, yet did not believe on Him, for fear of the high priests and the
rest of the rulers: “For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.”862 But
now, by confessing a good confession, we not only save ourselves, but we confirm those
who are newly illuminated, and strengthen the faith of the catechumens. But if we remit
any part of our confession, and deny godliness by the faintness of our persuasion, and the
fear of a very short punishment, we not only deprive ourselves of everlasting glory, but we
shall also become the causes of the perdition of others; and shall suffer double punishment,
as affording suspicion, by our denial that that truth which we gloried in so much before is
an erroneous doctrine. Wherefore neither let us be rash and hasty to thrust ourselves into
dangers, for the Lord says: “Pray that ye fall not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing,
but the flesh is weak.”863 Nor let us, when we do fall into dangers, be fearful or ashamed of
our profession. For if a person, by the denial of his own hope, which is Jesus the Son of God,
should be delivered from a temporary death, and the next day should fall dangerously sick
upon his bed, with a distemper in his bowels, his stomach, or his head, or any of the incurable

diseases, as a consumption, or gangrene, or looseness, or iliac passion, or dropsy, or colic,
and has a sudden catastrophe, and departs this life; is not he deprived of the things present,
and loses those eternal? Or rather, he is within the verge of eternal punishment, “and goes
into outer darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.”864 But let him who is vouchsafed
the honour of martyrdom rejoice with joy in the Lord, as obtaining thereby so great
a crown, and departing out of this life by his confession. Nay, though he be but a catechumen,
let him depart without trouble; for his suffering for Christ will be to him a more genuine
baptism, because he does really die with Christ, but the rest only in a figure. Let him therefore
rejoice in the imitation of his Master, since is it thus ordained: “Let every one be perfect, as
his Master is.”865 Now his and our Master, Jesus the Lord, was smitten for our sake: He
underwent reproaches and revilings with long-suffering. He was spit upon, He was smitten
on the face, He was buffeted; and when He had been scourged, He was nailed to the cross.
He had vinegar and gall to drink; and when He had fulfilled all things that were written, He
said to His God and Father, “Into Thy hands I commend my spirit.”866 Wherefore let him
that desires to be His disciple earnestly follow His conflicts: let him imitate His patience,
knowing that, although he be burned in the fire by men, he will suffer nothing, like the three
children;867 or if he does suffer anything, he shall receive a reward from the Lord, believing
in the one and the only true God and Father, through Jesus Christ, the great High Priest,
and Redeemer of our souls, and rewarder of our sufferings. To whom be glory for ever.

<head>SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS CONCERNING THE RESURRECTION, CONCERNING THE SIBYL, AND
WHAT THE STOICS SAY CONCERNING THE BIRD CALLED THE PHOENIX.</head>
<p>VII. For the Almighty God Himself will raise us up through our Lord Jesus Christ, according
to His infallible promise, and grant us a resurrection with all those that have slept
from the beginning of the world; and we shall then be such as we now are in our present
form, without any defect or corruption. For we shall rise incorruptible: whether we die at
sea, or are scattered on the earth, or are torn to pieces by wild beasts and birds, He will raise
us by His own power; for the whole world is held together by the hand of God. Now He
says: “An hair of your head shall not perish.”868 Wherefore He exhorts us, saying: “In your
patience possess ye your souls.”869 But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the
recompense of reward for the martyrs, Gabriel speaks to Daniel: “And many of them that

sleep shall arise out of the dust of the earth, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt. And they that understand shall shine as the sun, and as the firmament,
and as the stars.”870 Therefore the most holy Gabriel foretold that the saints should shine
like the stars: for His sacred name did witness to them, that they might understand the truth.
Nor is a resurrection only declared for the martyrs, but for all men, righteous and unrighteous,
godly and ungodly, that every one may receive according to his desert. For God, says
the Scripture, “will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be
good or whether it be evil.”871 This resurrection was not believed by the Jews, when of old
they said, “Our bones are withered, and we are gone.”872 To whom God answered, and said:
“Behold, I open your graves, and will bring you out of them; and I will put my Spirit into
you, and ye shall live: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it.” And
He says by Isaiah: “The dead shall rise, and those that are in the graves shall be raised up.
And those that rest in the earth shall rejoice, for the dew which is from Thee shall be healing
to them.”873 There are indeed many and various things said concerning the resurrection,
and concerning the continuance of the righteous in glory, and concerning the punishment
of the ungodly, their fall, rejection, condemnation, shame, “eternal fire, and endless worm.”874
Now that, if it had pleased Him that all men should be immortal, it was in His power, He
showed in the examples of Enoch and Elijah, while He did not suffer them to have any experience
of death. Or if it had pleased Him in every generation to raise those that died, that
this also He was able to do He hath made manifest both by Himself and by others; as when
He raised the widow’s son875 by Elijah, and the Shunammite’s son876 by Elisha. But we are
persuaded that death is not a retribution of punishment, because even the saints have undergone
it; nay, even the Lord of the saints, Jesus Christ, the life of them that believe, and
the resurrection of the dead. Upon this account, therefore, according to the ancient practice,
for those who live in the great city, after the combats He brings a dissolution for a while,
that, when He raises up every one, He may either reject him or crown him. For He that
made the body of Adam out of the earth will raise up the bodies of the rest, and that of the
first man, after their dissolution, (to pay what is owing to the rational nature of man; we
mean the continuance in being through all ages. He, therefore, who brings on the dissolution,
will Himself procure the resurrection. And He that said, “The Lord took dust from the

ground, and formed man, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a
living soul,”877 added after the disobedience, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return;”
878 the same promised us a resurrection afterwards.879) For says He: “All that are in
the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.”880 Besides
these arguments, we believe there is to be a resurrection also from the resurrection of our
Lord. For it is He that raised Lazarus, when he had been in the grave four days,881 and Jairus’
daughter,882 and the widow’s son.883 It is He that raised Himself by the command of the
Father in the space of three days, who is the pledge of our resurrection. For says He: “I am
the resurrection and the life.”884 Now He that brought Jonas885 in the space of three days,
alive and unhurt, out of the belly of the whale, and the three children out of the furnace of
Babylon, and Daniel out of the mouth of the lions,886 does not want power to raise us up
also. But if the Gentiles laugh at us, and disbelieve our Scriptures, let at least their own
prophetess Sibylla887 oblige them to believe, who says thus to them in express words:—
<lg>
<l>“But when all things shall be reduced to dust and ashes,</l>
<l>And the immortal God who kindled the fire shall have quenched it,</l>
<l>God shall form those bones and that ashes into a man again,</l>
<l>And shall place mortal men again as they were before.</l>
<l>And then shall be the judgment, wherein God will do justice,</l>
<l>And judge the world again. But as many mortals as have sinned through impiety</l>
<l>Shall again be covered under the earth;</l>
<l>But so many as have been pious shall live again in the world.</l>
<l>When God puts His Spirit into them, and gives those at once that are godly both</l>
<l rend="indent">life and favour,</l>

If, therefore, this prophetess confesses the resurrection, and does not deny the restoration
of all things, and distinguishes the godly from the ungodly, it is in vain for them to deny
our doctrine. Nay, indeed, they say they can show a resemblance of the resurrection, while
they do not themselves believe the things they declare: for they say that there is a bird single
in its kind which affords a copious demonstration of the resurrection, which they say is
without a mate, and the only one in the creation. They call it a phoenix, and relate that every
five hundred years it comes into Egypt, to that which is called the altar of the sun, and brings
with it a great quantity of cinnamon, and cassia, and balsam-wood, and standing towards
the east, as they say, and praying to the sun, of its own accord is burnt, and becomes dust;
but that a worm arises again out of those ashes, and that when the same is warmed it is
formed into a new-born phoenix; and when it is able to fly, it goes to Arabia, which is beyond
the Egyptian countries. If, therefore, as even themselves say, a resurrection is exhibited by
the means of an irrational bird, wherefore do they vainly disparage our accounts, when we
profess that He who by His power brings that into being which was not in being before, is
able to restore this body, and raise it up again after its dissolution? For on account of this
full assurance of hope we undergo stripes, and persecutions, and deaths. Otherwise we
should to no purpose undergo such things if we had not a full assurance of these promises,
whereof we profess ourselves to be the preachers. As, therefore, we believe Moses when he
says, “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth;”889 and we know that He did
not want matter, but by His will alone brought those things into being which Christ was
commanded to make; we mean the heaven, the earth, the sea, the light, the night, the day,
the luminaries, the stars, the fowls, the fishes, and four-footed beasts, the creeping things,
the plants, and the herbs; so also will He raise all men up by His will, as not wanting any
assistance. For it is the work of the same power to create the world and to raise the dead.
And then He made man, who was not a man before, of different parts, giving to him a soul
made out of nothing. But now He will restore the bodies, which have been dissolved, to the
souls that are still in being: for the rising again belongs to things laid down, not to things
which have no being. He therefore that made the original bodies out of nothing, and fashioned
various forms of them, will also again revive and raise up those that are dead. For He
that formed man in the womb out of a little seed, and created in him a soul which was not
in being before,—as He Himself somewhere speaks to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in
the womb I knew thee;”890 and elsewhere, “I am the Lord who established the heaven, and
laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man in him,”891—will also raise
up all men, as being His workmanship; as also the divine Scripture testifies that God said

to Christ, His only-begotten, “Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness. And
God made man: after the image of God made He him; male and female made He them.”892
And the most divine and patient Job, of whom the Scripture says that it is written, that “he
was to rise again with those whom the Lord raises up,”893 speaks to God thus: “Hast not
Thou milked me like milk, and curdled me like cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and
flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and
Thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. Having these things within me, I know that Thou
canst do all things, and that nothing is impossible with Thee.”894 Wherefore also895 our
Saviour and Master Jesus Christ says, that “what is impossible with men is possible with
God.”896 And David, the beloved of God, says: “Thine hands have made me, and fashioned
me.”897 And again: “Thou knowest my frame.”898 And afterward: “Thou hast fashioned
me, and laid Thine hand upon me. The knowledge of Thee is declared to be too wonderful
for me; it is very great, I cannot attain unto it.”899 “Thine eyes did see my substance, being
yet imperfect; and all men shall be written in Thy book.”900 Nay, and Isaiah says in his
prayer to Him: “We are the clay, and Thou art the framer of us.”901 If, therefore, man be
His workmanship, made by Christ, by Him most certainly will he after he is dead be raised
again, with intention either of being crowned for his good actions or punished for his
transgressions. But if He, being the legislator, judges with righteousness; as He punishes the
ungodly, so does He do good to and saves the faithful. And those saints who for His sake
have been slain by men, “some of them He will make light as the stars, and make others
bright as the luminaries,”902 as Gabriel said to Daniel. All we of the faithful, therefore, who
are the disciples of Christ, believe His promises. For He that has promised it cannot lie; as
says the blessed prophet David: “The Lord is faithful in all His words, and holy in all His
works.”903 For He that framed for Himself a body out of a virgin, is also the Former of

down. He who raises wheat out of the ground with many stalks from one grain, He who

<p>X. Now we exhort you, brethren and fellow-servants, to avoid vain talk and obscene
discourses, and jestings, drunkenness, lasciviousness, luxury, unbounded passions, with
foolish discourses, since we do not permit you so much as on the Lord’s days, which are
days of joy, to speak or act anything unseemly; for the Scripture somewhere says: “Serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.”919 Even your very rejoicings therefore
ought to be done with fear and trembling: for a Christian who is faithful ought neither to
repeat an heathen hymn nor an obscene song, because he will be obliged by that hymn to
make mention of the idolatrous names of demons; and instead of the Holy Spirit, the wicked
one will enter into him.</p>

wicked demons or the ridiculous contrivances of men. For somewhere God says concerning
the Israelites: “They have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods.”920 And after-

and admired the creature more than is fit. And sometimes they made a calf, as in the wilderness;
926 sometimes they worshipped Baalpeor;927 another time Baal,928 and Thamuz,929
and Astarte of Sidon;930 and again Moloch and Chamos;931 another time the sun,932 as it
is written in Ezekiel; nay, and besides, brute creatures, as among the Egyptians Apis, and
the Mendesian goat, and gods of silver and gold, as in Judea. On account of all which things
He threatened them, and said by the prophet: “Is it a small thing to the house of Judah to
do these abominations which they have done? For they have filled the land with their
wickedness, to provoke me to anger: and, behold, they are as those that mock. And I will
act with anger. Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have mercy; and they shall cry in mine
ears with a great voice, and I will not hearken unto them.”933 Consider, beloved, how many
things the Lord declares against idolaters, and the worshippers of the sun and moon.
Wherefore it is the duty of a man of God, as he is a Christian, not to swear by the sun, or
by the moon, or by the stars; nor by the heaven, nor by the earth, by any of the elements,
whether small or great. For if our Master charged us not to swear by the true God, that our
word might be firmer than an oath, nor by heaven itself, for that is a piece of heathen
wickedness, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the sanctuary of God, nor the altar, nor the gift, nor
the gilding of the altar, nor one’s own head,934 for this custom is a piece of Judaic corruption,
and on that account was forbidden; and if He exhorts the faithful that their yea be yea, and
their nay, nay, and says that “what is more than these is of the evil one,” how much more
blameable are those who appeal to deities falsely so called as the objects of an oath, and who
glorify imaginary beings instead of those that are real, whom God for their perverseness
“delivered over to foolishness, to do those things that are not convenient!”935</p>

<head>CONCERNING THE PASSION OF OUR LORD, AND WHAT WAS DONE ON EACH DAY OF HIS
SUFFERINGS; AND CONCERNING JUDAS, AND THAT JUDAS WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THE LORD
DELIVERED THE MYSTERIES TO HIS DISCIPLES.</head>
<p>XIV. For they began to hold a council against the Lord on the second day of the week,
in the first month, which is Xanthicus; and the deliberation continued on the third day of
the week; but on the fourth day they determined to take away His life by crucifixion. And
Judas knowing this, who for a long time had been perverted, but was then smitten by the
devil himself with the love of money, although he had been long entrusted with the purse,936
and used to steal what was set apart for the needy, yet was he not cast off by the Lord, through
much long-suffering; nay, and when we were once feasting with Him, being willing both to
reduce him to his duty and instruct us in His own foreknowledge, He said: “Verily, verily,
I say unto you, that one of you will betray me;” and every one of us saying, “Is it I?”937 And
the Lord being silent, I, who was one of the twelve, and more beloved by Him than the rest,
arose up from lying in His bosom, and besought Him to tell who it should be that should
betray Him. Yet neither then did our good Lord declare His name, but gave two signs of
the betrayer: one by saying, “he that dippeth with me in the dish;” a second, “to whom I
shall give the sop when I have dipped it.” Nay, although he himself said, “Master, is it I?”
the Lord did not say Yes, but, “Thou hast said.” And being willing to affright him in the
matter, He said: “Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for
him if he had never been born. Who, when he had heard that, went his way, and said to the
priests, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? And they bargained with
him for thirty pieces of silver.”938 And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, “And they

took939 the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued, whom they of the children
of Israel did value, and gave them for the house of the potter.”940 And on the fifth day of
the week, when we had eaten the passover with Him, and when Judas had dipped his hand
into the dish, and received the sop, and was gone out by night, the Lord said to us: “The
hour is come that ye shall be dispersed, and shall leave me alone;”941 and every one vehemently
affirming that they would not forsake Him, I Peter adding this promise, that I would
even die with Him, He said, “Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock crows, thou shall thrice
deny that thou knowest me.”942 And when He had delivered to us the representative mysteries
of His precious body and blood, Judas not being present with us, He went out to the
Mount of Olives, near the brook Cedron, where there was a garden;943 and we were with
Him, and sang an hymn according to the custom.944 And being separated not far945 from
us, He prayed to His Father, saying: “Father, remove this cup away from me; yet not my
will, but Thine be done.”946 And when He had done this thrice, while we out of despondency
of mind were fallen asleep, He came and said: “The hour is come, and the Son of man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. And behold Judas, and with him a multitude of ungodly
men,”947 to whom he shows the signal by which he was to betray Him—a deceitful kiss. But
they, when they had received the signal agreed on, took hold of the Lord; and having bound
Him, they led Him to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, wherein were assembled many,
not the people, but a great rout, not an holy council, but an assembly of the wicked and
council of the ungodly, who did many things against Him, and left no kind of injury untried,
spitting upon Him, cavilling at Him, beating Him, smiting Him on the face, reviling Him,
tempting Him, seeking vain divination instead of true prophecies from Him, calling Him
a deceiver, a blasphemer, a transgressor of Moses, a destroyer of the temple, a taker away
of sacrifices, an enemy to the Romans, an adversary to Cæsar. And these reproaches did
these bulls and dogs948 in their madness cast upon Him, till it was very early in the morning,

and then they lead Him away to Annas, who was father-in-law to Caiaphas; and when they
had done the like things to Him there, it being the day of the preparation, they delivered
Him to Pilate the Roman governor, accusing Him of many and great things, none of which
they could prove. Whereupon the governor, as out of patience with them, said: “I find no
cause against Him.”949 But they bringing two lying witnesses, wished to accuse the Lord
falsely; but they being found to disagree, and so their testimony not conspiring together,
they altered the accusation to that of treason, saying, “This fellow says that He is a king, and
forbids to give tribute to Cæsar.”950 And themselves became accusers, and witnesses, and
judges, and authors of the sentence, saying, “Crucify Him, crucify Him;”951 that it might
be fulfilled which is written by the prophets concerning Him, “Unjust witnesses were gathered
together against me, and injustice lied to itself;”952 and again, “Many dogs compassed me
about, the assembly of the wicked laid siege against me;”953 and elsewhere, “My inheritance
became to me as a lion in a wood, and has sent forth her voice against me.”954 Pilate therefore,
disgracing his authority by his pusillanimity, convicts himself of wickedness by regarding
the multitude more than this just person, and bearing witness to Him that He was innocent,
yet as guilty delivering Him up to the punishment of the cross, although the Romans had
made laws that no man unconvicted should be put to death. But the executioners took the
Lord of glory and nailed Him to the cross, crucifying Him indeed at the sixth hour, but
having received the sentence of His condemnation at the third hour. After this they gave to
Him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall. Then they divided His garments by lot. Then they
crucified two malefactors with Him, on each side one, that it might be fulfilled which was
written: “They gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.”955
And again: “They divided my garment among themselves, and upon my vesture have they
cast lots.”956 And in another place: “And I was reckoned with the transgressors.”957 Then
there was darkness for three hours, from the sixth to the ninth, and again light in the evening;
as it is written: “It shall not be day nor night, and at the evening there shall be light.”958 All

which things,959 when those malefactors saw that were crucified with Him, the one of them
reproached Him as though He was weak and unable to deliver Himself; but the other rebuked
the ignorance of his fellow and turning to the Lord, as being enlightened by Him, and acknowledging
who He was that suffered, he prayed that He would remember him in His
kingdom hereafter.960 He then presently granted him the forgiveness of his former sins,
and brought him into paradise to enjoy the mystical good things; who also cried out about
the ninth hour, and said to His Father: “My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken me?”961
And a little afterward, when He had cried with a loud voice, “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do,”962 and had added, “Into Thy hands I commit my spirit,” He gave
up the ghost,963 and was buried before sunset in a new sepulchre. But when the first day of
the week dawned He arose from the dead, and fulfilled those things which before His passion
He foretold to us, saying: “The Son of man must continue in the heart of the earth three
days and three nights.”964 And when He was risen from the dead, He appeared first to Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, then to Cleopas in the way, and after that to us
His disciples, who had fled away for fear of the Jews, but privately were very inquisitive
about Him.965 But these things are also written in the Gospel.</p>

their perdition. For even He Himself “wept over them, because they knew not the time of

the former on account of His being betrayed, and the latter on account of His passion. But
He appointed us to break our fast on the seventh day at the cock-crowing, but to fast on the
Sabbath-day. Not that the Sabbath-day is a day of fasting, being the rest from the creation,
but because we ought to fast on this one Sabbath only, while on this day the Creator was
under the earth. For on their very feast-day they apprehended the Lord, that oracle might
be fulfilled which says: “They placed their signs in the middle of their feast, and knew them
not.”967 Ye ought therefore to bewail over them, because when the Lord came they did not

<head>AN ENUMERATION OF THE PROPHETICAL PREDICTIONS WHICH DECLARE CHRIST, WHOSE
COMPLETION THOUGH THE JEWS SAW, YET OUT OF THE EVIL TEMPER OF THEIR MIND THEY DID
NOT BELIEVE HE WAS THE CHRIST OF GOD, AND CONDEMNED THE LORD OF GLORY TO THE
CROSS.</head>
<p>XVI. See how the people provoked the Lord by not believing in Him! Therefore He says:
“They provoked the Holy Spirit, and He was turned to be their enemy.”974 For blindness is
cast upon them, by reason of the wickedness of their mind, because when they saw Jesus
they did not believe Him to be the Christ of God, who was before all ages975 begotten of
Him, His only-begotten Son, God the Word, whom they did not own through their unbelief,
neither on account of His mighty works, nor yet on account of the prophecies which were
written concerning Him. For that He was to be born of a virgin, they read this prophecy:
“Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name

Emanuel.”976 “For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, whose government is upon
His shoulders; and His name is called the Angel of His Great Council, the Wonderful
Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Potentate, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the Future
Age.”977 Now, that because of their exceeding great wickedness they would not believe in
Him, the Lord shows in these words: “Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath
the arm of the Lord been revealed?”978 And afterward: “Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not
understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: for the heart of this people is
waxed gross.”979 Wherefore knowledge was taken from them, because seeing they overlooked,
and hearing they heard not. But to you, the converted of the Gentiles, is the kingdom given,
because you, who knew not God, have believed by preaching, and “have known Him, or
rather are known of Him,”980 through Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer of those that hope
in Him. For ye are translated from your former vain and tedious mode of life and have
contemned the lifeless idols, and despised the demons, which are in darkness, and have run
to the “true light,”981 and by it have “known the one and only true God and Father,”982 and
so are owned to be heirs of His kingdom. For since ye have “been baptized into the Lord’s
death,”983 and into His resurrection, as “new-born babes,”984 ye ought to be wholly free
from all sinful actions; “for you are not your own, but His that bought you”985 with His
own blood. For concerning the former Israel the Lord speaks thus, on account of their unbelief:
“The kingdom of God shall be taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits thereof;”986 that is to say, that having given the kingdom to you, who were once
far estranged from Him, He expects the fruits of your gratitude and probity. For ye are those
that were once sent into the vineyard, and did not obey, but these they that did obey;987 but
you have repented of your denial, and you work therein now. But they, being uneasy on
account of their own covenants, have not only left the vineyard uncultivated, but have also
killed the stewards of the Lord of the vineyard,988—one with stones, another with the sword;

And by them He was rejected as an unprofitable stone,992 but by you was received as the
corner-stone. Wherefore He says concerning you: “A people whom I knew not have served
me, and at the hearing of the ear have they obeyed me.”993</p>

<head>HOW THE PASSOVER OUGHT TO BE CELEBRATED.</head>
<p>XVII. It is therefore your duty, brethren, who are redeemed by the precious blood of
Christ, to observe the days of the passover exactly, with all care, after the vernal equinox,
lest ye be obliged to keep the memorial of the one passion twice in a year. Keep it once only
in a year for Him that died but once.</p>
<p>Do not you yourselves compute, but keep it when your brethren of the circumcision do so:
keep it together with them; and if they err in their computation, be not you concerned. Keep
your nights of watching in the middle of the days of unleavened bread. And when the Jews
are feasting, do you fast and wail over them, because an the day of their feast they crucified
Christ; and while they are lamenting and eating unleavened bread in bitterness, do you feast.994
But no longer be careful to keep the feast with the Jews, for we have now no communion
with them; for they have been led astray in regard to the calculation itself, which they think
they accomplish perfectly, that they may be led astray on every hand, and be fenced off from
the truth. But do you observe carefully the vernal equinox, which occurs on the twentysecond
of the twelfth month, which is Dystros (March), observing carefully until the twentyfirst
of the moon, lest the fourteenth of the moon shall fall on another week, and an error
being committed, you should through ignorance celebrate the passover twice in the year,
or celebrate the day of the resurrection of our Lord on any other day than a Sunday.</p>

<head>CONCERNING THE WATCHING ALL THE NIGHT OF THE GREAT SABBATH, AND CONCERNING THE
DAY OF THE RESURRECTION.</head>
<p>XIX. Wherefore we exhort you to fast on those days, as we also fasted till the evening,
when He was taken away from us; but on the rest of the days, before the day of the preparation,
let every one eat at the ninth hour, or at the evening, or as every one is able. But from
the even of the fifth day till cock-crowing break your fast when it is daybreak of the first day
of the week, which is the Lord’s day. From the even till cock-crowing keep awake, and assemble
together in the church, watch and pray, and entreat God; reading, when you sit up
all night, the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, until cock-crowing, and baptizing your
catechumens, and reading the Gospel with fear and trembling, and speaking to the people
such things as tend to their salvation: put an end to your sorrow, and beseech God that Israel
may be converted, and that He will allow them place of repentance, and the remission of
their impiety; for the judge, who was a stranger, “washed his hands, and said, I am innocent
of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. But Israel cried out, His blood be on us, and on
our children.”997 And when Pilate said, “Shall I crucify your king? they cried out, We have
no king but Cæsar: crucify Him, crucify Him; for every, one that maketh himself a king
speaketh against Cæsar.” And, “If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend.”998 And
Pilate the governor and Herod the king commanded Him to be crucified; and that oracle
was fulfilled which says, “Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vain things?
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the
Lord, and against His Christ;”999 and, “They cast away the Beloved, as a dead man, who is
abominable.”1000 And since He was crucified on the day of the Preparation, and rose again
at break of day on the Lord’s day, the scripture was fulfilled which saith, “Arise, O God;
judge the earth: for Thou shalt have an inheritance in all the nations;”1001 and again, “I will

Thou, Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up again, and I shall requite them.”1003 For
this reason do you also, now the Lord is risen, offer your sacrifice, concerning which He
made a constitution by us, saying, “Do this for a remembrance of me;”1004 and thenceforward
leave off your fasting, and rejoice, and keep a festival, because Jesus Christ, the pledge of
our resurrection, is risen from the dead. And let this be an everlasting ordinance till the
consummation of the world, until the Lord come. For to Jews the Lord is still dead, but to
Christians He is risen: to the former, by their unbelief; to the latter, by their full assurance
of faith. For the hope in Him is immortal and eternal life. After eight days let there be another
feast observed with honour, the eighth day itself, on which He gave me Thomas, who was
hard of belief, full assurance, by showing me the print of the nails, and the wound made in
His side by the spear.1005 And again, from the first Lord’s day count forty days, from the
Lord’s day till the fifth day of the week, and celebrate the feast of the ascension of the Lord,
whereon He finished all His dispensation and constitution, and returned to that God and
Father that sent Him, and sat down at the right hand of power, and remains there until His
enemies are put under His feet; who also will come at the consummation of the world with
power and great glory, to judge the quick and the dead, and to recompense to every one
according to his works. And then shall they see the beloved Son of God whom they
pierced;1006 and when they know Him, they shall mourn for themselves, tribe by tribe, and
their wives apart.1007</p>

<head>A PROPHETIC PREDICTION CONCERNING CHRIST JESUS.</head>
<p>XX. For even now, on the tenth day of the month Gorpiæus, when they assemble together,
they read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, in which it is said, “The Spirit before our face,
Christ the Lord was taken in their destructions;”1008 and Baruch, in whom it is written,
“This is our God; no other shall be esteemed with Him. He found out every way of knowledge,
and showed it to Jacob His son, and Israel His beloved. Afterwards He was seen upon earth,
and conversed with men.”1009 And when they read them, they lament and bewail, as
themselves suppose, that desolation which happened by Nebuchadnezzar; but, as the truth

after ten days from the ascension, which from the first Lord’s day is the fiftieth day, do ye
keep a great festival: for on that day, at the third hour, the Lord Jesus sent on us the gift of
the Holy Ghost, and we were filled with His energy, and we “spake with new tongues, as
that Spirit did suggest to us;”1010 and we preached both to Jews and Gentiles, that He is the
Christ of God, who is “determined by Him to be the Judge of quick and dead.”1011 To Him
did Moses bear witness, and said: “The Lord received fire from the Lord, and rained it
down.”1012 Him did Jacob see as a man, and said: “I have seen God face to face, and my soul
is preserved.”1013 Him did Abraham entertain, and acknowledge to be the Judge, and his
Lord.1014 Him did Moses see in the bush;1015 concerning Him did he speak in Deuteronomy:
“A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up unto you out of your brethren, like unto me;
Him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever He shall say unto you. And it shall be, that every
soul that will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among his people.”1016 Him
did Joshua the son of Nun see, as the captain of the Lord’s host, in armour, for their assistance
against Jericho; to whom he fell down, and worshipped, as a servant does to his master.1017
Him Samuel knew as the “Anointed of God,”1018 and thence named the priests and the
kings the anointed. Him David knew, and sung an hymn concerning Him, “A song concerning
the Beloved;”1019 and adds in his person, and says, “Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh,
O Thou who art mighty in Thy beauty and renown: go on, and prosper, and reign, for the
sake of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and Thy right hand shall guide Thee after
a wonderful manner. Thy darts are sharpened, O Thou that art mighty; the people shall fall
under Thee in the heart of the king’s enemies. Wherefore God, Thy God, hath anointed
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.” Concerning Him also spake Solomon, as
in His person: “The Lord created me the beginning of His ways, for His works: before the
world He founded me, in the beginning before He made the earth, before the fountains of
waters came, before the mountains were fastened; He begat me before all the hills.”1020 And
again: “Wisdom built herself an house.”1021 Concerning Him also Isaiah said: “A Branch

shall be a root of Jesse; and He that is to rise to reign over the Gentiles, in Him shall the
Gentiles trust.”1022 And Zechariah says:1023 “Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, just, and
having salvation; meek, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.”1024 Him
Daniel describes as “the Son of man coming to the Father,”1025 and receiving all judgment
and honour from Him; and as “the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and becoming
a great mountain, and filling the whole earth,”1026 dashing to pieces the many
governments of the smaller countries, and the polytheism of gods, but preaching the one
God, and ordaining the monarchy of the Romans. Concerning Him also did Jeremiah
prophesy, saying: “The Spirit before His face, Christ the Lord, was taken in their snares: of
whom we said, Under His shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.”1027 Ezekiel also, and
the following prophets, affirm everywhere that He is the Christ, the Lord, the King, the
Judge, the Lawgiver, the Angel of the Father, the only-begotten God. Him therefore do we
also preach to you, and declare Him to be God the Word, who ministered to His God and
Father for the creation of the universe. By believing in Him you shall live, but by disbelieving
you shall be punished. For “he that is disobedient to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath
of God abideth on him.”1028 Therefore, after you have kept the festival of Pentecost, keep
one week more festival, and after that fast; for it is reasonable to rejoice for the gift of God,
and to fast after that relaxation: for both Moses and Elijah fasted forty days, and Daniel for
“three weeks of days did not eat desirable bread, and flesh and wine did not enter into his
mouth.”1029 And blessed Hannah, when she asked for Samuel, said: “I have not drunk wine
nor strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.”1030 And the Ninevites, when
they fasted three days and three nights,1031 escaped the execution of wrath. And Esther, and
Mordecai, and Judith,1032 by fasting, escaped the insurrection of the ungodly Holofernes
and Haman. And David says: “My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh faileth for
want of oil.”1033 Do you therefore fast, and ask your petitions of God. We enjoin you to fast

<head>WHO THEY WERE THAT VENTURED TO MAKE SCHISMS, AND DID NOT ESCAPE PUNISHMENT.</head>
<p>I. Above all things, O bishop, avoid the sad and dangerous and most atheistical heresies,
eschewing them as fire that burns those that come near to it. Avoid also schisms: for it is
neither lawful to turn one’s mind towards wicked heresies, nor to separate from those of
the same sentiment out of ambition. For some who ventured to set up such practices of old
did not escape punishment. For Dathan and Abiram,1034 who set up in opposition to Moses,
were swallowed up into the earth. But Corah, and those two hundred and fifty who with
him raised a sedition against Aaron, were consumed by fire. Miriam also, who reproached
Moses, was cast out of the camp for seven days; for she said that Moses had taken an
Ethiopian to wife.1035 Nay, in the case of Azariah and Uzziah,1036 the latter of which was
king of Judah, but venturing to usurp the priesthood, and desiring to offer incense, which
it was not lawful for him to do, was hindered by Azariah the high priest, and the fourscore
priests; and when he would not obey he found the leprosy to arise in his forehead, and he
hastened to go out, because the Lord had reproved him.</p>

<head>THAT IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO RISE UP EITHER AGAINST THE KINGLY OR THE PRIESTLY OFFICE.</head>
<p>II. Let us therefore, beloved, consider what sort of glory that of the seditious is, and what
their condemnation. For if he that rises up against kings is worthy of punishment, even
though he be a son or a friend, how much more he that rises up against the priests! For by
how much the priesthood is more noble than the royal power, as having its concern about
the soul, so much has he a greater punishment who ventures to oppose the priesthood, than
he who ventures to oppose the royal power, although neither of them goes unpunished. For
neither did Absalom nor Abdadan1037 escape without punishment; nor Corah and
Dathan.1038 The former rose against David, and strove concerning the kingdom; the latter
against Moses, concerning pre-eminence. And they both spake evil; Absalom of his father
David, as of an unjust judge, saying to every one: “Thy words are good, but there is no one
that will hear thee, and do thee justice. Who will make me a ruler?”1039 But Abdadan: “I
have no part in David, nor any inheritance in the son of Jesse.”1040 It is plain that he could
not endure to be under David’s government, of whom God spake: “I have found David the

Abiram, and the followers of Corah, said to Moses: “Is it a small thing that thou hast brought
us out of the land of Egypt, out of a land flowing with milk and honey? And why hast thou
put out our eyes? And wilt thou rule over us?” And they gathered together against him a
great congregation; and the followers of Corah said: “Has God spoken alone to Moses? Why
is it that He has given the high-priesthood to Aaron alone? Is not all the congregation of
the Lord holy? And why is Aaron alone possessed of the priesthood?”1042 And before this,
one said: “Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?”1043</p>

Against him arose the followers of Corah, and the Reubenites,1055 and threw stones at Moses,
who prayed, and said: “Accept not Thou their offering.”1056 And the glory of God appeared,
and sent some down into the earth, and burnt up others with fire; and so, as to those
ringleaders of this schismatical deceit which said, “Let us make ourselves a leader,”1057 the
earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their tents, and what appertained to
them, and they went down alive into hell; but he destroyed the followers of Corah with fire.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>THAT SCHISM IS MADE, NOT BY HIM WHO SEPARATES HIMSELF FROM THE UNGODLY, BUT WHO
DEPARTS FROM THE GODLY.</head>
<p>IV. If therefore God inflicted punishment immediately on those that made a schism on
account of their ambition, how much rather will He do it upon those who are the leaders
of impious heresies! Will not He inflict severer punishment on those that blaspheme His
providence or His creation? But do you, brethren, who are instructed out of the Scripture,
take care not to make divisions in opinion, nor divisions in unity. For those who set up
unlawful opinions are marks of perdition to the people. In like manner, do not you of the
laity come near to such as advance doctrines contrary to the mind of God; nor be you partakers
of their impiety. For says God: “Separate yourselves from the midst of these men, lest
you perish together with them.”1058 And again: “Depart from the midst of them, and separate
yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.”1059</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<head>UPON WHAT ACCOUNT ISRAEL, FALSELY SO NAMED, IS REJECTED BY GOD, DEMONSTRATED FROM
THE PROPHETIC PREDICTIONS.</head>
<p>V. For those are most certainly to be avoided who blaspheme God. The greatest part of
the ungodly, indeed, are ignorant of God; but these men, as fighters against God, are possessed
with a wilful evil disposition, as with a disease. For from the wickedness of these
heretics “pollution is gone out upon all the earth,”1060 as says the prophet Jeremiah. For the
wicked synagogue is now cast off by the Lord God, and His house is rejected by Him, as He
somewhere speaks: “I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine inheritance.”1061 And
again, says Isaiah: “I will neglect my vineyard, and it shall not be pruned nor digged, and
thorns shall spring up upon it, as upon a desert; and I will command the clouds that they
rain no rain upon it.”1062 He has therefore “left His people as a tent in a vineyard, and as a
garner in a fig or olive yard, and as a besieged city.”1063 He has taken away from them the
Holy Spirit, and the prophetic rain, and has replenished His Church with spiritual grace, as
the “river of Egypt in the time of first-fruits;”1064 and has advanced the same “as an house
upon an hill, or as an high mountain; as a mountain fruitful for milk and fatness, wherein
it has pleased God to dwell. For the Lord will inhabit therein to the end.”1065 And He says

in Jeremiah: “Our sanctuary is an exalted throne of glory.”1066 And He says in Isaiah: “And
it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and
the house of the Lord shall be upon the top of the mountains, and shall be advanced above
the hills.”1067 Since, therefore, He has forsaken His people, He has also left His temple desolate,
and rent the veil of the temple, and took from them the Holy Spirit; for says He, “Behold,
your house is left unto you desolate.”1068 And He has bestowed upon you, the converted
of the Gentiles, spiritual grace, as He says by Joel: “And it shall come to pass after these
things, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons shall
prophesy, and your daughters shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.”1069
For God has taken away all the power and efficacy of His word, and such like visitations,
from that people, and has transferred it to you, the converted of the Gentiles. For on this
account the devil himself is very angry at the holy Church of God: he is removed to you,
and has raised against you adversities, seditions, and reproaches, schisms, and heresies. For
he had before subdued that people to himself, by their slaying of Christ. But you who have
left his vanities he tempts in different ways, as he did the blessed Job.1070 For indeed he
opposed that great high priest Joshua the son of Josedek;1071 and he oftentimes sought to
sift us, that our faith might fail.1072 But our Lord and Master, having brought him to trial,
said unto him: “The Lord rebuke thee, O devil; and the Lord, who hath chosen Jerusalem,
rebuke thee. Is not this plucked out of the fire as a brand?”1073 And who said then to those
that stood by the high priest, “Take away his ragged garments from him;” and added, “Behold,
I have taken thine iniquities away from thee;” He will say now, as He said formerly of us
when we were assembled together, “I have prayed that your faith may not fail.”1074</p>

who do not confess the resurrection of the dead; and the Pharisees, who ascribe the practice

Hemerobaptists, who every day, unless they wash, do not eat,—nay, and unless they cleanse
their beds and tables, or platters and cups and seats, do not make use of any of them; and
those who are newly risen amongst us, the Ebionites, who will have the Son of God to be a
mere man, begotten by human pleasure, and the conjunction of Joseph and Mary. There
are also those that separate themselves from all these, and observe the laws of their fathers,
and these are the Essenes. These, therefore, arose among the former people. And now the
evil one, who is wise to do mischief, and as for goodness, knows no such good thing, has
cast out some from among us, and has wrought by them heresies and schisms.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<head>WHENCE THE HERESIES SPRANG, AND WHO WAS THE RINGLEADER OF THEIR IMPIETY.</head>
<p>VII. Now the original of the new heresies began thus: the devil entered into one Simon,
of a village called Gitthæ, a Samaritan, by profession a magician, and made him the minister
of his wicked design.1075 For when Philip our fellow-apostle,1076 by the gift of the Lord and
the energy of His Spirit, performed the miracles of healing in Samaria, insomuch that the
Samaritans were affected, and embraced the faith of the God of the universe, and of the
Lord Jesus, and were baptized into His name; nay, and that Simon himself, when he saw
the signs and wonders which were done without any magic ceremonies, fell into admiration,
and believed, and was baptized, and continued in fasting and prayer,—we heard of the grace
of God which was among the Samaritans by Philip, and came down1077 to them; and enlarging
much upon the word of doctrine, we laid our hands upon all that were baptized, and
we conferred upon them the participation of the Spirit. But when Simon saw that the Spirit
was given to believers by the imposition of our hands, he took money, and offered it to us,
saying, “Give me also the power, that on whomsoever I also shall lay my hand, he may receive
the Holy Ghost;”1078 being desirous that as the devil1079 deprived Adam by his tasting of
the tree of that immortality which was promised him, so also that Simon might entice us
by the receiving of money, and might thereby cut us off from the gift of God,1080 that so by
exchange we might sell to him for money the inestimable gift of the Spirit. But as we were
all troubled at this offer, I Peter, with a fixed attention on that malicious serpent which was
in him, said to Simon: “Let thy money go with thee to perdition, because thou hast thought
to purchase the gift of God with money. Thou hast no part in this matter, nor lot in this

and pray to the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive
thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.”1081 But then Simon was terrified,
and said: “I entreat you, pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of those things which ye have
spoken come upon me.”1082</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<head>WHO WERE THE SUCCESSORS OF SIMON’S IMPIETY, AND WHAT HERESIES THEY SET UP.</head>
<p>VIII. But when we went forth among the Gentiles to preach the word of life, then the
devil wrought in the people to send after us false apostles to the corrupting of the word; and
they sent forth one Cleobius, and joined him with Simon, and these became disciples to one
Dositheus, whom they despising, put him down from the principality. Afterwards also
others were the authors of absurd doctrines: Cerinthus, and Marcus, and Menander, and
Basilides, and Saturnilus. Of these some own the doctrine of many gods, some only of three,
but contrary to each other, without beginning, and ever with one another, and some of an
infinite number of them, and those unknown ones also. And some reject marriage; and their
doctrine is, that it is not the appointment of God; and others abhor some kinds of food:
some are impudent in uncleanness, such as those who are falsely called Nicolaitans. And
Simon meeting me Peter, first at Cæsarea Stratonis (where the faithful Cornelius, a Gentile,
believed on the Lord Jesus by me), endeavoured to pervert the word of God; there being
with me the holy children, Zacchæus, who was once a publican, and Barnabas; and Nicetas
and Aquila, brethren of Clement the bishop and citizen of Rome, who was the disciple of
Paul, our fellow-apostle and fellow-helper in the Gospel. I thrice discoursed before them
with him concerning the true Prophet, and concerning the monarchy of God; and when I
had overcome him by the power of the Lord, and had put him to silence, I drove him away
into Italy.</p>

<head>HOW SIMON, DESIRING TO FLY BY SOME MAGICAL ARTS, FELL DOWN HEADLONG FROM ON HIGH
AT THE PRAYERS OF PETER, AND BRAKE HIS FEET, AND HANDS, AND ANKLE-BONES.</head>
<p>IX. Now when he was in Rome, he mightily disturbed the Church, and subverted many,
and brought them over to himself, and astonished the Gentiles with his skill in magic, insomuch
that once, in the middle of the day, he went into their theatre, and commanded the
people that they should bring me also by force into the theatre, and promised he would fly
in the air; and when all the people were in suspense at this, I prayed by myself. And indeed
he was carried up into the air by demons, and did fly on high in the air, saying that he was
returning into heaven, and that he would supply them with good things from thence. And
the people making acclamations to him, as to a god, I stretched out my hands to heaven,
with my mind, and besought God through the Lord Jesus to throw down this pestilent fellow,

<pb n="1003"/>
and to destroy the power of those demons that made use of the same for the seduction and
perdition of men, to dash him against the ground, and bruise him, but not to kill him. And
then, fixing my eyes on Simon, I said to him: “If I be a man of God, and a real apostle of
Jesus Christ, and a teacher of piety, and not of deceit, as thou art, Simon, I command the
wicked powers of the apostate from piety, by whom Simon the magician is carried, to let go
their hold, that he may fall down headlong from his height, that he may be exposed to the
laughter of those that have been seduced by him.” When I had said these words, Simon was
deprived of his powers, and fell down headlong with a great noise, and was violently dashed
against the ground, and had his hip and ankle-bones broken; and the people cried out, saying,
“There is one only God, whom Peter rightly preaches in truth.” And many left him; but
some who were worthy of perdition continued in his wicked doctrine. And after this manner
the most atheistical heresy of the Simonians was first established in Rome; and the devil
wrought by the rest of the false apostles1083 also.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">    
<head>HOW THE HERESIES DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER, AND FROM THE TRUTH.</head>
<p>X. Now all these had one and the same design of atheism, to blaspheme Almighty God,
to spread their doctrine that He is an unknown being, and not the Father of Christ, nor the
Creator of the world; but one who cannot be spoken of, ineffable, not to be named, and begotten
by Himself; that we are not to make use of the law and the prophets; that there is no
providence and no resurrection to be believed; that there is no judgment nor retribution;
that the soul is not immortal; that we must only indulge our pleasures, and turn to any sort
of worship without distinction. Some of them say that there are many gods, some that there
are three gods without beginning, some that there are two unbegotten gods, some that there
are innumerable Æons. Further, some of them teach that men are not to marry, and must
abstain from flesh and wine, affirming that marriage, and the begetting of children, and the
eating of certain foods, are abominable; that so, as sober persons, they may make their
wicked opinions to be received as worthy of belief. And some of them absolutely prohibit
the eating of flesh, as being the flesh not of brute animals, but of creatures that have a rational
soul, as though those that ventured to slay them would be charged with the crime of murder.
But others of them affirm that we must only abstain from swine’s flesh, but may eat such as
are clean by the law; and that we ought to be circumcised, according to the law, and to believe
in Jesus as in an holy man and a prophet. But others teach that men ought to be impudent
in uncleanness, and to abuse the flesh, and to go through all unholy practices, as if this were
the only way for the soul to avoid the rulers of this world. Now all these are the instruments
of the devil, and the children of wrath.</p>

<head>SEC. III.—THE HERESIES ATTACKED BY THE APOSTLES.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>AN EXPOSITION OF THE PREACHING OF THE APOSTLES.</head>
<p>XI. But we, who are the children of God and the sons of peace, do preach the holy and
right word of piety, and declare one only God, the Lord of the law and of the prophets, the
Maker of the world, the Father of Christ; not a being that caused Himself, or begat Himself,
as they suppose, but eternal, and without original, and inhabiting light inaccessible; not two
or three, or manifold, but eternally one only; not a being that cannot be known or spoken
of, but who was preached by the law and the prophets; the Almighty, the Supreme Governor
of all things, the All-powerful Being; the God and Father of the Only-begotten, and of the
First-born of the whole creation; one God, the Father of one Son, not of many; the Maker
of one Comforter by Christ, the Maker of the other orders, the one Creator of the several
creatures by Christ, the same their Preserver and Legislator by Him; the cause of the resurrection,
and of the judgment, and of the retribution which shall be made by Him: that this
same Christ was pleased to become man, and went through life without sin, and suffered,
and rose from the dead, and returned to Him that sent Him. We also say that every creature
of God is good, and nothing abominable; that everything for the support of life, when it is
partaken of righteously, is very good: for, according to the Scripture, “all things were very
good.”1084 We believe that lawful marriage, and the begetting of children, is honourable
and undefiled; for difference of sexes was formed in Adam and Eve for the increase of
mankind. We acknowledge with us a soul that is incorporeal and immortal,—not corruptible
as bodies are, but immortal, as being rational and free. We abhor all unlawful mixtures, and
that which is practised by some against nature as wicked and impious. We profess there will
be a resurrection both of the just and unjust, and a retribution. We profess that Christ is
not a mere man, but God the Word, and man the Mediator between God and men, the High
Priest of the Father; nor are we circumcised with the Jews, as knowing that He is come “to
whom the inheritance was reserved,”1085 and on whose account the families were kept distinct—“
the expectation of the Gentiles,” Jesus Christ, who sprang out of Judah,1086 the Son
from the branch, the flower from Jesse, whose government is upon His shoulder.1087</p>
<p>FOR THOSE THAT CONFESS CHRIST, BUT ARE DESIROUS TO JUDAIZE.</p>
<p>XII. But because this heresy did then seem the more powerful to seduce men, and the
whole Church was in danger,1088 we the twelve assembled together at Jerusalem (for Matthias

was chosen to be an apostle in the room of the betrayer, and took the lot of Judas; as it is
said, “His bishopric1089 let another take”). We deliberated, together with James the Lord’s
brother, what was to be done; and it seemed good to him and to the elders to speak to the
people words of doctrine. For certain men likewise went down from Judea to Antioch, and
taught the brethren who were there, saying: “Unless ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, and walk according to the other customs which he ordained, ye cannot be saved.”1090
When, therefore, there had been no small dissension and disputation, the brethren which
were at Antioch, when they knew that we were all met together about this question, sent
out unto us men who were faithful and understanding in the Scriptures to learn concerning
this question. And they, when they were come to Jerusalem, declared to us what questions
were arisen in the church of Antioch,—namely, that some said men ought to be circumcised,
and to observe the other purifications. And when some said one thing, and some another,
I Peter stood up, and said unto them: “Men and brethren, ye know how that from ancient
days God made choice among you that the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel by
my mouth, and believe; and God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness.1091 For an
angel of the Lord appeared on a certain time to Cornelius,1092 who was a centurion of the
Roman government, and spake to him concerning me, that he should send for me, and hear
the word of life from my mouth. He therefore sent for me from Joppa to Cæsarea Stratonis;
and when I was ready to go to him, I would have eaten. And while they made ready I was
in the upper room praying; and I saw heaven opened, and a vessel, knit at the four corners
like a splendid sheet, let down to the earth, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts,
and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the heaven. And there came a voice out of
heaven to me, saying, Arise, Peter; kill, and eat. And I said, By no means, Lord: for I have
never eaten anything common or unclean. And there came a voice a second time, saying,
What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. And this was done thrice, and the
vessel was received up again into heaven. But as I doubted what this vision should mean,
the Spirit said to me, Behold, men seek thee; but rise up, and go thy way with them, nothing
doubting, for I have sent them.1093 These men were those which came from the centurion,
and so by reasoning I understood the word of the Lord which is written: ‘Whosoever shall
call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’1094 And again: ‘All the ends of the earth shall
remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all the families of the heathen shall worship before

Him: for the kingdom is in the Lord’s, and He is the governor of the nations.’1095 And observing
that there were expressions everywhere concerning the calling of the Gentiles, I rose
up, and went with them, and entered into the man’s house. And while I was preaching the
word, the Holy Spirit fell upon him, and upon those that were with him, as it did upon us
at the beginning; and He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
faith. And I perceived that God is no respecter of persons; but that in every nation he that
feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, will be accepted with Him. But even the believers
which were of the circumcision were astonished at this. Now therefore why tempt ye God,
to lay an heavy yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither we nor our fathers were
able to bear? But by the grace of the Lord, we believe we shall be saved, even as they.1096
For the Lord has loosed us from our bonds, and has made our burden light, and has loosed
the heavy yoke from us by His clemency.” While I spake these things, the whole multitude
kept silence. But James the Lord’s brother answered and said: “Men and brethren, hearken
unto me; Simeon hath declared how God at first visited to take out a people from the Gentiles
for His name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written: ‘Afterwards I will
return, and will raise again and rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and
I will rebuild its ruins, and will again set it up, that the residue of men may seek after the
Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doth these
things.’1097 Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world. Wherefore
my sentence is, that we do not trouble those who from among the Gentiles turn unto God:
but to charge them that they abstain from the pollutions of the Gentiles, and from what is
sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; which
laws were given to the ancients who lived before the law, under the law of nature, Enos,
Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Job, and if there be any other of the same sort.”1098 Then it
seemed good to us the apostles, and to James the bishop, and to the elders, with the whole
Church, to send men chosen from among our own selves, with Barnabas, and Paul of Tarsus,
the apostle of the Gentiles, and Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among
the brethren, and wrote by their hand, as follows: “The apostles, and elders, and brethren,1099
to the brethren of Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia of the Gentiles, send greeting: Since we have
heard that some from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we
gave no such commandment, it has seemed good to us, when we were met together with
one accord, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have

with them Judas and Silas, who shall themselves declare the same things by mouth. For it
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay no other burden upon you than these necessary
things; that ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication: from which things if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well.

marriage is unblameable. For “the woman is suited to the man by the Lord;”1105 and the
Lord says: “He that made them from the beginning, made them male and female; and said,
For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife:
and they two shall be one flesh.”1106 Nor let it be esteemed lawful after marriage to put her
away who is without blame. For says He: “Thou shalt take care to thy spirit, and shalt not
forsake the wife of thy youth; for she is the partner1107 of thy life, and the remains of thy
spirit. I and no other have made her.”1108 For the Lord says: “What God has joined together,
let no man put asunder.”1109 For the wife is the partner of life, united by God unto one body
from two. But he that divides that again into two which is become one, is the enemy of the
creation of God, and the adversary of His providence. In like manner, he that retains her
that is corrupted is a transgressor of the law of nature; since “he that retains an adulteress
is foolish and impious.”1110 For says He, “Cut her off from thy flesh;”1111 for she is not an
help, but a snare, bending her mind from thee to another. Nor be ye circumcised in your
flesh, but let the circumcision which is of the heart by the Spirit suffice for the faithful; for
He says, “Be ye circumcised to your God, and be circumcised in the foreskin of your
heart.”1112</p>

the Lord afresh, slay Him a second time, laugh at divine and ridicule holy things, affront
the Spirit, dishonour the sacred blood of Christ as common blood, are impious against Him
that sent, Him that suffered, and Him that witnessed. Nay, he that, out of contempt, will
not be baptized, shall be condemned as an unbeliever, and shall be reproached as ungrateful
and foolish. For the Lord says: “Except a man be baptized of water and of the Spirit, he shall
by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.”1115 And again: “He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”1116 But he that says,
When I am dying I will be baptized, lest I should sin and defile my baptism, is ignorant of
God, and forgetful of his own nature. For “do not thou delay to turn unto the Lord, for thou
knowest not what the next day will bring forth.”1117 Do you also baptize your infants, and

who are past repentance, and separate them from the faithful, and excommunicate them

“The wicked doers pretend to act piously.” For, says he, “there is a way which seemeth right

whom the Lord declared His mind with bitterness and severity, saying that “they are false
Christs and false teachers;”1123 who have blasphemed the Spirit of grace, and done despite
to the gift they had from Him after the grace of baptism, “to whom forgiveness shall not be

tread under foot His Son, and do despite to the doctrine of the Spirit; who deny the words

he that walketh with wise men shall be wise, but he that walketh with the foolish shall be
known.”1126 For we ought neither to run along with a thief, nor put in our lot with an
adulterer; since holy David says: “O Lord, I have hated them that hate Thee, and I am
withered away on account of Thy enemies. I hated them with a perfect hatred: they were to
me as enemies.”1127 And God reproaches Jehoshaphat with his friendship towards Ahab,
and his league with him and with Ahaziah, by Jonah the prophet: “Art thou in friendship
with a sinner? Or dost thou aid him that is hated by the Lord?”1128 “For this cause the wrath
of the Lord would be upon thee suddenly, but that thy heart is found perfect with the Lord.
For this cause the Lord hath spared thee; yet are thy works shattered, and thy ships broken
to pieces.”1129 Eschew therefore their fellowship, and estrange yourselves from their
friendship. For concerning them did the prophet declare, and say: “It is not lawful to rejoice
with the ungodly,”1130 says the Lord. For these are hidden wolves, dumb dogs, that cannot
bark, who at present are but few, but in process of time, when the end of the world draws
nigh, will be more in number and more troublesome, of whom said the Lord, “Will the Son
of man, when He comes, find faith on the earth?”1131 and, “Because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold;” and, “There shall come false Christs and false prophets,
and shall show signs in the heaven, so as, if it were possible, to deceive the elect:”1132 from
whose deceit God, through Jesus Christ, who is our hope, will deliver us. For we ourselves,
as we passed through the nations, and confirmed the churches, curing some with much exhortation
and healing words, restored them again when they were in the certain way to
death. But those that were incurable we cast out from the flock, that they might not infect
the lambs, which were found with their scabby disease, but might continue before the Lord
God pure and undefiled, sound and unspotted. And this we did in every city, everywhere
through the whole world, and have left to you the bishops and to the rest of the priests this
very Catholic doctrine worthily and righteously, as a memorial or confirmation to those
who have believed in God; and we have sent it by our fellow-minister Clement, our most

<head>TO THOSE THAT SPEAK EVIL OF THE LAW.</head>
<p>XIX. For since ye have known God through Jesus Christ, and all His dispensation, as it
has been from the beginning, that He gave a plain law to assist the law of nature,1135 such
a one as is pure, saving, and holy, in which His own name was inscribed,1136 perfect, which
is never to fail, being complete in ten commands, unspotted, converting souls;1137 which,
when the Hebrews forgot, He put them in mind of it by the prophet Malachi, saying, “Remember
ye the law of Moses, the man of God, who gave you in charge commandments and
ordinances.”1138 Which law is so very holy and righteous, that even our Saviour, when on
a certain time He healed one leper, and afterwards nine, said to the first, “Go, show thyself
to the high priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them;”1139
and afterwards to the nine, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.”1140 For He nowhere has
dissolved the law, as Simon pretends, but fulfilled it; for He says: “One iota, or one tittle,
shall not pass from the law until all be fulfilled.” For says He, “I come not to dissolve the
law, but to fulfil it.”1141 For Moses himself, who was at once the lawgiver, and the high
priest, and the prophet, and the king, and Elijah, the zealous follower of the prophets, were
present at our Lord’s transfiguration in the mountain,1142 and witnesses of His incarnation
and of His sufferings, as the intimate friends of Christ, but not as enemies and strangers.
Whence it is demonstrated that the law is good and holy, as also the prophets.</p>

the law is righteous, and therefore is it called the law, because judgments are thence made
according to the law of nature, which the followers of Simon abuse, supposing they shall
not be judged thereby, and so shall escape punishment. This law is good, holy, and such as
lays no compulsion in things positive. For He says: “If thou wilt make me an altar, thou
shalt make it of earth.”1145 It does not say, “Make one,” but, “If thou wilt make.” It does not
impose a necessity, but gives leave to their own free liberty. For God does not stand in need
of sacrifices, being by nature above all want. But knowing that, as of old, Abel, beloved of
God, and Noah and Abraham, and those that succeeded, without being required, but only
moved of themselves by the law of nature, did offer sacrifice to God out of a grateful mind;
so He did now permit the Hebrews, not commanding, but, if they had a mind, permitting
them; and if they offered from a right intention, showing Himself pleased with their sacrifices.
Therefore He says: “If thou desirest to offer, do not offer to me as to one that stands in need
of it, for I stand in need of nothing; for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.”1146 But
when this people became forgetful of that, and called upon a calf as God, instead of the true
God, and to him did ascribe the cause of their coming out of Egypt, saying, “These are thy
gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt;”1147 and when these men
had committed wickedness with the “similitude of a calf that eateth hay;” and denied God
who had visited them by Moses1148 in their afflictions, and had done signs with his hand
and rod, and had smitten the Egyptians with ten plagues; who had divided the waters of the
Red Sea into two parts; who had led them in the midst of the water, as a horse upon the
ground; who had drowned their enemies, and those that laid wait for them; who at Marah
had made sweet the bitter fountain; who had brought water out of the sharp rock till they
were satisfied; who had overshadowed them with a pillar of a cloud on account of the immoderate
heat, and with a pillar of fire which enlightened and guided them when they knew
not which way they were to go; who gave them manna from heaven, and gave them quails
for flesh from the sea;1149 who gave them the law in the mountain; whose voice He had
vouchsafed to let them hear; Him did they deny, and said to Aaron, “Make us gods who
shall go before us;”1150 and they made a molten calf, and sacrificed to an idol;—then was
God angry, as being ungratefully treated by them, and bound them with bonds which could
not be loosed, with a mortifying burden and a hard collar, and no longer said, “If thou
makest,” but, “Make an altar,” and sacrifice perpetually; for thou art forgetful and ungrateful.

the former, and abolished the latter, and has again set the free-will of man at liberty,
not subjecting him to the penalty of a temporal death, but giving laws to him according to

And again: “Will ye also go away?”1158 And besides, before His coming He refused the
sacrifices of the people, while they frequently offered them, when they sinned against Him,
and thought He was to be appeased by sacrifices, but not by repentance. For thus He speaks:
“Why dost thou bring to me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a remote land?
Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not sweet to me.”1159 And
afterwards: “Gather your burnt-offerings, together with your sacrifices, and eat flesh. For I
did not command you, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings
and sacrifices.”1160 And He says by Isaiah: “To what purpose do ye bring me a
multitude of sacrifices? saith the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and I will
not accept the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and of goats. Nor do you come and appear
before me; for who hath required these things at your hands? Do not go on to tread my
courts any more. If you bring me fine flour, it is vain: incense is an abomination unto me:
your new moons, and your Sabbaths, and your great day, I cannot bear them: your fasts,
and your rests, and your feasts, my soul hateth them; I am over-full of them.”1161 And He
says by another: “Depart from me; the sound of thine hymns, and the psalms of thy musical
instruments, I will not hear.”1162 And Samuel says to Saul, when he thought to sacrifice:
“Obedience is better than sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams. For, behold, the
Lord does not so much delight in sacrifice, as in obeying Him.”1163 And He says by David:
“I will take no calves out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy flock. If I should be hungry,
I would not tell thee; for the whole world is mine, and the fulness thereof. Shall I eat the
flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Sacrifice to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay
thy vows to the Most High.”1164 And in all the Scriptures in like manner He refuses their
sacrifices on account of their sinning against Him. For “the sacrifices of the impious are an
abomination with the Lord, since they offer them in an unlawful manner.”1165 And again:

“Their sacrifices are to them as bread of lamentation; all that eat of them shall be defiled.”1166
If, therefore, before His coining He sought for “a clean heart and a contrite spirit”1167 more
than sacrifices, much rather would He abrogate those sacrifices, I mean those by blood,
when He came. Yet He so abrogated them as that He first fulfilled them. For He was both
circumcised, and sprinkled, and offered sacrifices and whole burnt-offerings, and made use
of the rest of their customs. And He that was the Lawgiver became Himself the fulfilling of

were an unrighteous thing, but because long-suffering is more excellent. Nor did He
make laws to root out our natural passions, but only to forbid the excess of them.1176 He
who had commanded to honour our parents, was Himself subject to them.1177 He who had
commanded to keep the Sabbath, by resting thereon for the sake of meditating on the laws,
has now commanded us to consider of the law of creation, and of providence every day,
and to return thanks to God. He abrogated circumcision when He had Himself fulfilled it.

For He it was “to whom the inheritance was reserved, who was the expectation of the nations.”
1178 He who made a law for swearing rightly, and forbade perjury, has now charged
us not to swear at all.1179 He has in several ways changed baptism, sacrifice, the priesthood,
and the divine service, which was confined to one place: for instead of daily baptisms, He
has given only one, which is that into His death. Instead of one tribe, He has appointed that
out of every nation the best should be ordained for the priesthood; and that not their bodies
should be examined for blemishes, but their religion and their lives. Instead of a bloody
sacrifice, He has appointed that reasonable and unbloody mystical one of His body and
blood, which is performed to represent the death of the Lord by symbols. Instead of the divine
service confined to one place, He has commanded and appointed that He should be glorified
from sunrising to sunsetting in every place of His dominion.1180 He did not therefore take
away the law from us, but the bonds. For concerning the law Moses says: “Thou shalt meditate
on the word which I command thee, sitting in thine house, and rising up, and walking
in the way.”1181 And David says: “His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law will
he meditate day and night.”1182 For everywhere would he have us subject to His laws, but
not transgressors of them. For says He: “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in
the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that search out His testimonies; with their whole heart
shall they seek Him.”1183 And again: “Blessed are we, O Israel, because those things that are
pleasing to God are known to us.”1184 And the Lord says: “If ye know these things, happy
are ye if ye do them.”1185</p>

<head>HOW GOD, ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR IMPIETY TOWARDS CHRIST, MADE THE JEWS CAPTIVES, AND
PLACED THEM UNDER TRIBUTE.</head>
<p>XXV. Because, indeed, they drew servitude upon themselves voluntarily, when they
said, “We have no king but Cæsar;”1186 and, “If we do not slay Christ, all men will believe
in Him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation.”1187 And
so they prophesied unwittingly. For accordingly the nations believed on Him, and they
themselves were deprived by the Romans of their power, and of their legal worship; and
they have been forbidden to slay whom they please, and to sacrifice when they will.
Wherefore they are accursed, as not able to perform the things they are commanded to do.
For says He: “Cursed be he that does not continue in all things that are written in the book
of the law to do them.”1188 Now it is impossible in their dispersion, while they are among
the heathen, for them to perform all things in their law. For the divine Moses forbids both
to rear an altar out of Jerusalem, and to read the law out of the bounds of Judea.1189 Let us
therefore follow Christ, that we may inherit His blessings. Let us walk after the law and the
prophets by the Gospel. Let us eschew the worshippers of many gods, and the murderers
of Christ, and the murderers of the prophets, and the wicked and atheistical heretics. Let us
be obedient to Christ as to our King, as having authority to change several constitutions,
and having, as a legislator, wisdom to make new constitutions in different circumstances;
yet so that everywhere the laws of nature be immutably preserved.</p>

<head>SEC. V.—THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES IN OPPOSITION TO JEWISH AND
GENTILE SUPERSTITIONS, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO MARRIAGE AND
FUNERALS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>THAT WE OUGHT TO AVOID THE HERETICS AS THE CORRUPTERS OF SOULS.</head>
<p>XXVI. Do you therefore, O bishops, and ye of the laity, avoid all heretics who abuse the
law and the prophets. For they are enemies to God Almighty, and disobey Him, and do not
confess Christ to be the Son of God. For they also deny His generation according to the
flesh; they are ashamed of the cross; they abuse His passion and His death; they know not
His resurrection; they take away His generation before all ages. Nay, some of them are impious
after another manner, imagining the Lord to be a mere man, supposing Him to consist
of a soul and body. But others of them suppose that Jesus Himself is the God over all, and
glorify Him as His own Father, and suppose Him to be both the Son and the Comforter;
than which doctrines what can be more detestable? Others, again, of them do refuse certain
meats, and say that marriage with the procreation of children is evil, and the contrivance
of the devil; and being ungodly themselves, they are not willing to rise again from the dead
on account of their wickedness. Wherefore also they ridicule the resurrection, and say, We
are holy people, unwilling to eat and to drink; and they fancy that they shall rise again from
the dead demons without flesh, who shall be condemned for ever in eternal fire. Fly therefore
from them, lest ye perish with them in their impieties.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<head>OF SOME JEWISH AND GENTILE OBSERVANCES.</head>
<p>XXVII. Now if any persons keep to the Jewish customs and observances concerning the
natural emission and nocturnal pollutions, and the lawful conjugal acts,1190 let them tell us
whether in those hours or days, when they undergo any such thing, they observe not to
pray, or to touch a Bible, or to partake of the Eucharist? And if they own it to be so, it is
plain they are void of the Holy Spirit, which always continues with the faithful. For concerning
holy persons Solomon says: “That every one may prepare himself, that so when he sleeps
it may keep him, and when he arises it may talk with him.”1191 For if thou thinkest, O woman,
when thou art seven days in thy separation, that thou art void of the Holy Spirit, then if thou
shouldest die suddenly thou wilt depart void of the Spirit, and without assured hope in God;
or else thou must imagine that the Spirit always is inseparable from thee, as not being in a
place. But thou standest in need of prayer and the Eucharist, and the coming of the Holy
Ghost, as having been guilty of no fault in this matter. For neither lawful mixture, nor childbearing,
nor the menstrual purgation, nor nocturnal pollution, can defile the nature of a
man, or separate the Holy Spirit from him. Nothing but impiety and unlawful practice can
<note type="footnote">1190 Lev. xv.</note>
<note type="footnote">1191 Prov. vi. 22.</note>

<pb n="1020"/>
do that. For the Holy Spirit always abides with those that are possessed of it, so long as they
are worthy; and those from whom it is departed, it leaves them desolate, and exposed to the
wicked spirit. Now every man is filled either with the holy or with the unclean spirit; and it
is not possible to avoid the one or the other, unless they can receive opposite spirits. For the
Comforter hates every lie, and the devil hates all truth. But every one that is baptized
agreeably to the truth is separated from the diabolical spirit, and is under the Holy Spirit;
and the Holy Spirit remains with him so long as he is doing good, and fills him with wisdom
and understanding, and suffers not the wicked spirit to approach him, but watches over his
goings. Thou therefore, O woman, if, as thou sayest, in the days of thy separation thou art
void of the Holy Spirit, thou art then filled with the unclean one; for by neglecting to pray
and to read thou wilt invite him to thee, though he were unwilling. For this spirit, of all
others, loves the ungrateful, the slothful, the careless, and the drowsy, since he himself by
ingratitude was distempered with evil mind, and was thereby deprived by God his dignity;
having rather chosen to be a devil than an archangel. Wherefore, O woman, eschew such
vain words, and be ever mindful of God that created thee, and pray to Him. For He is thy
Lord, and the Lord of the universe; and meditate in His laws without observing any such
things, such as the natural purgation, lawful mixture, child-birth, a miscarriage, or a blemish
of the body; since such observations are the vain inventions of foolish men, and such inventions
as have no sense in them. Neither the burial of a man, nor a dead man’s bone, nor a
sepulchre, nor any particular sort of food, nor the nocturnal pollution, can defile the soul
of man; but only impiety towards God, and transgression, and injustice towards one’s
neighbour; I mean rapine, violence, or if there be anything contrary to His righteousness,
adultery or fornication. Wherefore, beloved, avoid and eschew such observations, for they
are heathenish. For we do not abominate a dead man, as do they, seeing we hope that he
will live again. Nor do we hate lawful mixture; for it is their practice to act impiously in such
instances. For the conjunction of man and wife, if it be with righteousness, is agreeable to
the mind of God. “For He that made them at the beginning made them male and female;
and He blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.”1192 If, therefore,
the difference of sexes was made by the will of God for the generation of multitudes, then
must the conjunction of male and female be also acceptable to His mind.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>OF THE LOVE OF BOYS, ADULTERY, AND FORNICATION.</head>
<p>XXVIII. But we do not say so of that mixture that is contrary to nature, or of any unlawful
practice; for such are enmity to God. For the sin of Sodom is contrary to nature, as is also
that with brute beasts. But adultery and fornication are against the law; the one whereof is
impiety, the other injustice, and, in a word, no other than a great sin. But neither sort of
them is without its punishment in its own proper nature. For the practisers of one sort at-

<pb n="1021"/>
tempt the dissolution of the world, and endeavour to make the natural course of things to
change for one that is unnatural; but those of the second sort—the adulterers—are unjust
by corrupting others’ marriages, and dividing into two what God hath made one, rendering
the children suspected, and exposing the true husband to the snares of others. And fornication
is the destruction of one’s own flesh, not being made use of for the procreation of children,
but entirely for the sake of pleasure, which is a mark of incontinency, and not a sign of virtue.
All these things are forbidden by the laws; for thus say the oracles: “Thou shalt not lie with
mankind as with womankind.”1193 “For such a one is accursed, and ye shall stone them
with stones: they have wrought abomination.”1194 “Every one that lieth with a beast, slay
ye him: he has wrought wickedness in his people.”1195 “And if any one defile a married
woman, slay ye them both: they have wrought wickedness; they are guilty; let them die.”1196
And afterwards: “There shall not be a fornicator among the children of Israel, and there
shall not be an whore among the daughters of Israel. Thou shalt not offer the hire of an
harlot to the Lord thy God upon the altar, nor the price of a dog.”1197 “For the vows arising
from the hire of an harlot are not clean.”1198 These things the laws have forbidden, but they
have honoured marriage, and have called it blessed, since God has blessed it who joined
male and female together.1199 And wise Solomon somewhere says: “A wife is suited to her
husband by the Lord.”1200 And David says: “Thy wife is like a flourishing vine in the sides
of thine house; thy children like olive-branches round about thy table. Behold, thus shall
the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.”1201 Wherefore “marriage is honourable”1202 and
comely, and the begetting of children pure, for there is no evil in that which is good.
Therefore neither is the natural purgation abominable before God, who has ordered it to
happen to women within the space of thirty days for their advantage and healthful state,
who do less move about, and keep usually at home in the house. Nay, moreover, even in the
Gospel, when the woman with the perpetual purgation of blood1203 touched the saving
border of the Lord’s garment in hope of being healed, He was not angry at her, nor did

complain of her at all; but, on the contrary, He healed her, saying, “Thy faith hath saved
thee.” When the natural purgations do appear in the wives, let not their husbands approach
them, out of regard to the children to be begotten; for the law has forbidden it, for it says:
“Thou shalt not come near thy wife when she is in her separation.”1204 Nor, indeed, let them
frequent their wives’ company when they are with child.1205 For they do this not for the
begetting of children, but for the sake of pleasure. Now a lover of God ought not to be a
lover of pleasure.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<head>HOW WIVES OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN HUSBANDS, AND HUSBANDS OUGHT TO LOVE
THEIR OWN WIVES.</head>
<p>XXXIX. Ye wives, be subject to your own husbands, and have them in esteem, and serve
them with fear and love, as holy Sarah honoured Abraham. For she could not endure to call
him by his name, but called him lord, when she said, “My lord is old.”1206 In like manner,
ye husbands, love your own wives as your own members, as partners in life, and fellowhelpers
for the procreation of children. For says He, “Rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let
her conversation be to thee as a loving hind, and a pleasant foal; let her alone guide thee,
and be with thee at all times: for if thou beest every way encompassed with her friendship,
thou wilt be happy in her society.”1207 Love them therefore as your own members, as your
very bodies; for so it is written, “The Lord has testified between thee and between the wife
of thy youth; and she is thy partner, and another has not made her: and she is the remains
of thy spirit;” and, “Take heed to your spirit, and do not forsake the wife of thy youth.”1208
An husband, therefore, and a wife, when they company together in lawful marriage, and
rise from one another, may pray without any observations, and without washing are clean.
But whosoever corrupts and defiles another man’s wife, or is defiled with an harlot, when
he arises up from her, though he should wash himself in the entire ocean and all the rivers,
cannot be clean.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>THAT IT IS THE CUSTOM OF JEWS AND GENTILES TO OBSERVE NATURAL PURGATIONS, AND TO
ABOMINATE THE REMAINS OF THE DEAD; BUT THAT ALL THIS IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIANITY.</head>
<p>XXX. Do not therefore keep any such observances about legal and natural purgations,
as thinking you are defiled by them. Neither do you seek after Jewish separations, or perpetual
washings, or purifications upon the touch of a dead body. But without such observations
assemble in the dormitories, reading the holy books, and singing for the martyrs which
are fallen asleep, and for all the saints from the beginning of the world, and for your brethren
that are asleep in the Lord, and offer the acceptable Eucharist, the representation of the
royal body of Christ, both in your churches and in the dormitories; and in the funerals of
the departed, accompany them with singing, if they were faithful in Christ. For “precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.”1209 And again: “O my soul, return unto
thy rest, for the Lord hath done thee good.”1210 And elsewhere: “The memory of the just is
with encomiums.”1211 And, “The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God.”1212 For
those that have believed in God, although they are asleep, are not dead. For our Saviour says
to the Sadducees: “But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which
is written, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God,
therefore, is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.”1213 Wherefore,
of those that live with God, even their very relics are not without honour. For even Elisha
the prophet, after he was fallen asleep, raised up a dead man who was slain by the pirates of
Syria.1214 For his body touched the bones of Elisha, and he arose and revived. Now this
would not have happened unless the body of Elisha were holy. And chaste Joseph embraced
Jacob after he was dead upon his bed;1215 and Moses and Joshua the son of Nun carried
away the relics of Joseph,1216 and did not esteem it a defilement. Whence you also, O bishops,
and the rest, who without such observances touch the departed, ought not to think yourselves
defiled. Nor abhor the relics of such persons, but avoid such observances, for they are foolish.
And adorn yourselves with holiness and chastity, that ye may become partakers of immortality,
and partners of the kingdom of God, and may receive the promise of God, and may
rest for ever, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

<p>I. The lawgiver Moses said to the Israelites, “Behold, I have set before your face the way
of life and the way of death;”1221 and added, “Choose life, that thou mayest live.”1222 Elijah
the prophet also said to the people: “How long will you halt with both your legs? If the Lord

for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
the other.”1224 We also, following our teacher Christ, “who is the Saviour of all men, especially
of those that believe,”1225 are obliged to say that there are two ways—the one of life, the
other of death;1226 which have no comparison one with another, for they are very different,
1227 or rather entirely separate; and the way of life is that of nature, but that of death

thanks is it if ye love those that love you? for even the Gentiles do the same.”1234 “But do
ye love those that hate you, and ye shall have no enemy.” For says He, “Thou shalt not hate
any man; no, not an Egyptian, nor an Edomite;”1235 for they are all the workmanship of
God. Avoid not the persons, but the sentiments, of the wicked. “Abstain from fleshly and
worldly lusts.”1236 “If any one gives thee a stroke on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also.”1237 Not that revenge is evil, but that patience is more honourable. For David says, “If
I have made returns to them that repaid me evil.”1238 “If any one compel thee to go a mile,
go with him twain.”1239 And, “He that will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
him have thy cloak also.”1240 “And from him that taketh thy goods, require them not
again.”1241 “Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee do not
shut thy hand.”1242 For “the righteous man is pitiful, and lendeth.”1243 For your Father
would have you give to all, who Himself “maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good,

and in the conclusion shall seal him with the ointment; that the anointing with oil may be
the participation of the Holy Spirit, and the water the symbol of the death of Christ, and the
ointment the seal of the covenants. But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water is sufficient
both for the anointing, and for the seal, and for the confession of Him that is dead, or indeed
is dying together with Christ. But before baptism, let him that is to be baptized fast; for even
the Lord, when He was first baptized by John, and abode in the wilderness, did afterward
fast forty days and forty nights.1326 But He was baptized, and then fasted, not having Himself
any need of cleansing, or of fasting, or of purgation, who was by nature pure and holy; but
that He might testify the truth to John, and afford an example to us. Wherefore our Lord
was not baptized into His own passion, or death, or resurrection—for none of those things
had then happened—but for another purpose. Wherefore He by His own authority fasted
after His baptism, as being the Lord of John. But he who is to be initiated into His death
ought first to fast, and then to be baptized. For it is not reasonable that he who has been
buried with Christ, and is risen again with Him, should appear dejected at His very resurrection.

out against the Lord, Judas then promising to betray Him for money; and you must fast on
the day of the Preparation, because on that day the Lord suffered the death of the cross under
Pontius Pilate. But keep the Sabbath, and the Lord’s day festival; because the former is the
memorial of the creation, and the latter of the resurrection. But there is one only Sabbath
to be observed by you in the whole year, which is that of our Lord’s burial, on which men
ought to keep a fast, but not a festival. For inasmuch as the Creator was then under the earth,
the sorrow for Him is more forcible than the joy for the creation; for the Creator is more
honourable by nature and dignity than His own creatures.</p>

<p>XXIV. Now, “when ye pray, be not ye as the hypocrites;”1328 but as the Lord has appointed
us in the Gospel, so pray ye: “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth; give us this day our daily

but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom for ever. Amen.”1329 Pray thus thrice in
a day, preparing yourselves beforehand, that ye may be worthy of the adoption of the Father;
lest, when you call Him Father unworthily, you be reproached by Him, as Israel once His
first-born son was told: “If I be a Father, where is my glory? And if I be a Lord, where is my
fear?”1330 For the glory of fathers is the holiness of their children, and the honour of masters
is the fear of their servants, as the contrary is dishonour and confusion. For says He: “Through
you my name is blasphemed among the Gentiles.”1331</p>

<head>A MYSTICAL THANKSGIVING.</head>
<p>XXXV. Be ye always thankful, as faithful and honest servants; and concerning the
eucharistical thanksgiving say thus:1332 We thank Thee, our Father, for that life which Thou
hast made known to us by Jesus Thy Son, by whom Thou madest all things, and takest care
of the whole world; whom Thou hast sent to become man for our salvation; whom Thou
hast permitted to suffer and to die; whom Thou hast raised up, and been pleased to glorify,
and hast set Him down on Thy right hand; by whom Thou hast promised us the resurrection
of the dead. Do thou, O Lord Almighty, everlasting God, so gather together Thy Church
from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom, as this corn was once scattered, and is now
become one loaf. We also, our Father, thank Thee for the precious blood of Jesus Christ,
which was shed for us and for His precious body, whereof we celebrate this representation,
as Himself appointed us, “to show forth His death.”1333 For through Him glory is to be
given to Thee for ever. Amen. Let no one eat of these things that is not initiated; but those
only who have been baptized into the death of the Lord. But if any one that is not initiated
conceal himself, and partake of the same, “he eats eternal damnation;”1334 because, being
not of the faith of Christ, he has partaken of such things as it is not lawful for him to partake
of, to his own punishment. But if any one is a partaker through ignorance, instruct him
quickly, and initiate him, that he may not go out and despise you.</p>

Thou hast purchased with the precious blood of Thy Christ, and deliver it from all evil, and
perfect it in Thy love and Thy truth, and gather us all together into Thy kingdom which
Thou hast prepared. Let this Thy kingdom come.1336 “Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed

righteous cry aloud, upon Thee do the hopes of the godly trust, Thou Father of the blameless,
Thou hearer of the supplication of those that call upon Thee with uprightness, and who
knowest the supplications that are not uttered: for Thy providence reaches as far as the inmost
parts of mankind; and by Thy knowledge Thou searchest the thoughts of every one, and in
every region of the whole earth the incense of prayer and supplication is sent up to Thee.
O Thou who hast appointed this present world as a place of combat to righteousness, and
hast opened to all the gate of mercy, and hast demonstrated to every man by implanted
knowledge, and natural judgment, and the admonitions of the law, how the possession of
riches is not everlasting, the ornament of beauty is not perpetual, our strength and force are
easily dissolved; and that all is vapour and vanity; and that only the good conscience of faith
unfeigned passes through the midst of the heavens, and returning with truth, takes hold of
the right hand of the joy1356 which is to come. And withal, before the promise of the restoration
of all things is accomplished, the soul itself exults in hope, and is joyful. For from that
truth which was in our forefather Abraham, when he changed his way Thou didst guide
him by a vision, and didst teach him what kind of state this world is; and knowledge went
before his faith, and faith was the consequence of his knowledge; and the covenant did follow
after his faith. For Thou saidst: “I will make thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand
which is by the seashore.”1357 Moreover, when Thou hadst given him Isaac, and knewest
him to be like him in his mode of life, Thou wast then called his God, saying: “I will be a
God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.”1358 And when our father Jacob was sent into
Mesopotamia, Thou showedst him Christ, and by him speakest, saying: “Behold, I am with
thee, and I will increase thee, and multiply thee exceedingly.”1359 And so spakest Thou to
Moses, Thy faithful and holy servant, at the vision of the bush: “I am He that is; this is my
name for ever, and my memorial for generations of generations.”1360 O Thou great protector

The light also and the sun were begotten for days and the production of fruit, and the moon
for the change of seasons, by its increase and diminutions; and one was called Night, and
the other Day. And the firmament was exhibited in the midst of the abyss, and Thou commandedst
the waters to be gathered together, and the dry land to appear. But as for the sea
itself, who can possibly describe it, which comes with fury from the ocean, yet runs back
again, being stopped by the sand at Thy command? For Thou hast said: “Thereby shall her
waves be broken.”1361 Thou hast also made it capable of supporting little and great creatures,
and made it navigable for ships. Then did the earth become green, and was planted with all
sorts of flowers, and the variety of several trees; and the shining luminaries, the nourishers
of those plants, preserve their unchangeable course, and in nothing depart from Thy command.
But where Thou biddest them, there do they rise and set for signs of the seasons and
of the years, making a constant return of the work of men. Afterwards the kinds of the several
animals were created—those belonging to the land, to the water, to the air, and both to
air and water; and the artificial wisdom of Thy providence does still impart to every one a
suitable providence. For as He was not unable to produce different kinds, so neither has He
disdained to exercise a different providence towards every one. And at the conclusion of
the creation Thou gavest direction to Thy Wisdom, and formedst a reasonable creature as
the citizen of the world, saying, “Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness;”1362
and hast exhibited him as the ornament of the world, and formed him a body out of the
four elements, those primary bodies, but hadst prepared a soul out of nothing, and bestowedst
upon him his five senses, and didst set over his sensations a mind as the conductor of the
soul. And besides all these things, O Lord God, who can worthily declare the motion of the
rainy clouds, the shining of the lightning, the noise of the thunder, in order to the supply
of proper food, and the most agreeable temperature of the air? But when man was disobedient,
Thou didst deprive him of the life which should have been his reward. Yet didst Thou
not destroy him for ever, but laidst him to sleep for a time; and Thou didst by oath call him
to a resurrection, and loosedst the bond of death, O Thou reviver of the dead, through Jesus
Christ, who is our hope.</p>

come to judgment immediately, when, after so much long-suffering, we hardly get clear of
our miserable condition? The heavens declare Thy dominion, and the earth shakes with
earthquakes, and, hanging upon nothing, declares Thy unshaken stedfastness. The sea raging
with waves, and feeding a flock of ten thousand creatures, is bounded with sand, as standing
in awe at Thy command, and compels all men to dry out: “How great are Thy works, O
Lord! in wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of Thy creation.”1363 And the
bright host of angels and the intellectual spirits say to Palmoni,1364 “There is but one holy
Being;”1365 and the holy seraphim, together with the six-winged cherubim, who sing to
Thee their triumphal song, cry out with never-ceasing voices, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
of hosts! heaven and earth are full of Thy glory;”1366 and the other multitudes of the orders,
angels archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, authorities, and powers cry aloud,
and say, “Blessed be the glory of the Lord out of His place.”1367 But Israel, Thy Church on
earth, taken out of the Gentiles, emulating the heavenly powers night and day, with a full
heart and a willing soul sings, “The chariot of God is ten thousandfold thousands of them
that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.”1368 The heaven knows Him
who fixed it as a cube of stone, in the form of an arch, upon nothing, who united the land
and water to one another, and scattered the vital air all abroad, and conjoined fire therewith
for warmth, and the comfort against darkness. The choir of stars strikes us with admiration,
declaring Him that numbers them, and showing Him that names them; the animals declare
Him that puts life into them; the trees show Him that makes them grow: all which creatures,
being made by Thy word, show forth the greatness of Thy power. Wherefore every man
ought to send up an hymn from his very soul to Thee, through Christ, in the name of all
the rest, since He has power over them all by Thy appointment. For Thou art kind in Thy
benefits, and beneficent in Thy bowels of compassion, who alone art almighty: for when
Thou willest, to be able is present with Thee; for Thy eternal power both quenches flame,
and stops the mouths of lions, and tames whales, and raises up the sick, and overrules the
power of all things, and overturns the host of enemies, and casts down a people numbered
in their arrogance. Thou art He who art in heaven, He who art on earth, He who art in the

account we solemnly assemble to celebrate the feast of the resurrection on the Lord’s day,
and rejoice on account of Him who has conquered death, and has brought life and immortality
to light. For by Him Thou hast brought home the Gentiles to Thyself for a peculiar
people, the true Israel beloved of God, and seeing God. For Thou O Lord, broughtest our
fathers out of the land of Egypt, and didst deliver them out of the iron furnace, from clay
and brick-making, and didst redeem them out of the hands of Pharaoh, and of those under
him, and didst lead them through the sea as through dry land, and didst bear their manners

law or decalogue, which was pronounced by Thy voice and written with Thy hand. Thou
didst enjoin the observation of the Sabbath, not affording them an occasion of idleness, but
an opportunity of piety, for their knowledge of Thy power, and the prohibition of evils;
having limited them as within an holy circuit for the sake of doctrine, for the rejoicing upon
the seventh period. On this account was there appointed one week, and seven weeks, and
the seventh month, and the seventh year, and the revolution of these, the jubilee, which is
the fiftieth year for remission, that men might have no occasion to pretend ignorance.1372
On this account He permitted men every Sabbath to rest, that so no one might be willing
to send one word out of his mouth in anger on the day of the Sabbath. For the Sabbath is
the ceasing of the creation, the completion of the world, the inquiry after laws, and the
grateful praise to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon men. All which the Lord’s
day excels,1373 and shows the Mediator Himself, the Provider, the Lawgiver, the Cause of
the resurrection, the First-born of the whole creation, God the Word, and man, who was
born of Mary alone, without a man, who lived holily, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
and died, and rose again from the dead. So that the Lord’s day commands us to offer unto
Thee, O Lord, thanksgiving for all.1374 For this is the grace afforded by Thee, which on account
of its greatness has obscured all other blessings.</p>

<head>A PRAYER FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE RIGHTEOUS.</head>
<p>XXXVIII. We give Thee thanks for all things, O Lord Almighty, that Thou hast not
taken away Thy mercies and Thy compassions from us; but in every succeeding generation
Thou dost save, and deliver, and assist, and protect: for Thou didst assist in the days of Enos
and Enoch, in the days of Moses and Joshua, in the days of the judges, in the days of Samuel
and of Elijah and of the prophets, in the days of David and of the kings, in the days of Esther
and Mordecai, in the days of Judith, in the days of Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and
in our days hast Thou assisted us by Thy great High Priest, Jesus Christ Thy Son. For He
has delivered us from the sword, and hath freed us from famine, and sustained us; has delivered
us from sickness, has preserved us from an evil tongue. For all which things do we
give Thee thanks through Christ, who has given us an articulate voice to confess withal, and
added to it a suitable tongue as an instrument to modulate withal, and a proper taste, and
a suitable touch, and a sight for contemplation, and the hearing of sounds, and the smelling
of vapours, and hands for work, and feet for walking. And all these members dost Thou
form from a little drop in the womb; and after the formation dost Thou bestow on it an
immortal soul, and producest it into the light as a rational creature, even man. Thou hast
instructed him by Thy laws, improved him by Thy statutes; and when Thou bringest on a
dissolution for a while, Thou hast promised a resurrection. Wherefore what life is sufficient,
what length of ages will be long enough, for men to be thankful? To do it worthily it is impossible,
but to do it according to our ability is just and right. For Thou hast delivered us
from the impiety of polytheism, and from the heresy of the murderers of Christ; Thou hast
delivered us from error and ignorance; Thou hast sent Christ among men as a man, being
the only begotten God; Thou hast made the Comforter to inhabit among us; Thou hast set
angels over us; Thou hast put the devil to shame; Thou hast brought us into being when we
were not. Thou takest care of us when made; Thou measurest out life to us; Thou affordest
us food; Thou hast promised repentance. Glory and worship be to Thee for all these things,
through Jesus Christ,1402 now and ever, and through all ages. Amen. Meditate on these
things, brethren; and the Lord be With you upon earth, and in the kingdom of His Father,
who both sent Him, and has “delivered us by Him from the bondage of corruption into His
glorious liberty;”1403 and has promised life to those who through Him have believed in the
God of the whole world.</p>

<head>SEC. III.—ON THE INSTRUCTION OF CATECHUMENS, AND THEIR INITIATION
INTO BAPTISM.</head>
<p>Now, after what manner those ought to live that are initiated into Christ, and what
thanksgivings they ought to send up to God through Christ, has been said in the foregoing
directions. But it is reasonable not to leave even those who are not yet initiated without assistance.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<p>HOW THE CATECHUMENS ARE TO BE INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS.</p>
<p>XXXIX. Let him, therefore, who is to be taught the truth in regard to piety be instructed
before his baptism in the knowledge of the unbegotten God, in the understanding of His
only begotten Son, in the assured acknowledgment of the Holy Ghost. Let him learn the
order of the several parts of the creation, the series of providence, the different dispensations
of Thy laws. Let him be instructed why the world was made, and why man was appointed
to be a citizen therein; let him also know his own nature, of what sort it is; let him be taught
how God punished the wicked with water and fire, and did glorify the saints in every generation—
I mean Seth, and Enos, and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham and his posterity, and
Melchizedek, and Job, and Moses, and Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas the priest, and those
that were holy in every generation; and how God still took care of and did not reject mankind,
but called them from their error and vanity to the acknowledgment of the truth at various
seasons, reducing them from bondage and impiety unto liberty and piety, from injustice to
righteousness, from death eternal to everlasting life. Let him that offers himself to baptism
learn these and the like things during the time that he is a catechumen; and let him who
lays his hands upon him adore God, the Lord of the whole world, and thank Him for His
creation, for His sending Christ His only begotten Son, that He might save man by blotting
out his transgressions, and that He might remit ungodliness and sins, and might “purify
him from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,”1404 and sanctify man according to the good
pleasure of His kindness, that He might inspire him with the knowledge of His will, and
enlighten the eyes of his heart to consider of His wonderful works, and make known to him
the judgments of righteousness, that so he might hate every way of iniquity, and walk in the
way of truth, that he might be thought worthy of the laver of regeneration, to the adoption
of sons, which is in Christ, that “being planted together in the likeness of the death of
Christ,”1405 in hopes of a glorious communication, he may be mortified to sin, and may
live to God, as to his mind, and word, and deed, and may be numbered together in the book
of the living. And after this thanksgiving, let him instruct him in the doctrines concerning
our Lord’s incarnation, and in those concerning His passion, and resurrection from the
dead, and assumption.</p>

<p>A CONSTITUTION HOW THE CATECHUMENS ARE TO BE BLESSED BY THE PRIESTS IN THEIR
INITIATION, AND WHAT THINGS ARE TO BE TAUGHT THEM.</p>
<p>XL. And when it remains that the catechumen is to be baptized, let him learn what
concerns the renunciation of the devil, and the joining himself with Christ; for it is fit that
he should first abstain from things contrary, and then be admitted to the mysteries. He must
beforehand purify his heart from all wickedness of disposition, from all spot and wrinkle,
and then partake of the holy things; for as the skilfullest husbandman does first purge his
ground of the thorns which are grown up therein, and does then sow his wheat, so ought
you also to take away all impiety from them, and then to sow the seeds of piety in them, and
vouchsafe them baptism. For even our Lord did in this manner exhort us, saying first, “Make
disciples of all nations;”1406 and then He adds this, “and baptize them into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Let, therefore, the candidate for baptism
declare thus in his renunciation:1407—</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<p>THE RENUNCIATION OF THE ADVERSARY, AND THE DEDICATION TO THE CHRIST OF GOD.</p>
<p>XLI. I renounce Satan, and his works, and his pomps, and his worships, and his angels,
and his inventions, and all things that are under him. And after his renunciation let him in
his consociation say: And I associate myself to Christ, and believe, and am baptized into
one unbegotten Being, the only true God Almighty, the Father of Christ, the Creator and
Maker of all things, from whom are all things; and into the Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten
Son, the First-born of the whole creation, who before the ages was begotten by the
good pleasure of the Father, by whom all things were made, both those in heaven and those
on earth, visible and invisible; who in the last days descended from heaven, and took flesh,
and was born of the holy Virgin Mary, and did converse holily according to the laws of His
God and Father, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and died for us, and rose again
from the dead after His passion the third day, and ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at
the right hand of the Father, and again is to come at the end of the world with glory to judge
the quick and the dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. And I am baptized into
the Holy Ghost, that is, the Comforter, who wrought in all the saints from the beginning of
the world, but was afterwards sent to the apostles by the Father, according to the promise
of our Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ; and after the apostles, to all those that believe in the
Holy Catholic Church; into the resurrection of the flesh, and into the remission of sins, and
into the kingdom of heaven, and into the life of the world to come. And after this vow, he
comes in order to the anointing with oil.</p>

<head>A THANKSGIVING CONCERNING THE ANOINTING WITH THE MYSTICAL OIL.</head>
<p>XLII. Now this is blessed by the high priest for the remission of sins, and the first preparation
for baptism. For he calls thus upon the unbegotten God, the Father of Christ, the
King of all sensible and intelligible natures, that He would sanctify the oil in the name of
the Lord Jesus, and impart to it spiritual grace and efficacious strength, the remission of
sins, and the first preparation for the confession of baptism, that so the candidate for baptism,
when he is anointed may be freed from all ungodliness, and may become worthy of initiation,
according to the command of the Only-begotten.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<p>A THANKSGIVING CONCERNING THE MYSTICAL WATER.</p>
<p>XLIII. After this he comes to the water, and blesses and glorifies the Lord God Almighty,
the Father of the only begotten God;1408 and the priest returns thanks that He has sent His
Son to become man on our account, that He might save us; that He has permitted that He
should in all things become obedient to the laws of that incarnation, to preach the kingdom
of heaven, the remission of sins, and the resurrection of the dead. Moreover, he adores the
only begotten God Himself, after His Father, and for Him, giving Him thanks that He undertook
to die for all men by the cross, the type of which He has appointed to be the baptism
of regeneration. He glorifies Him also, for that God who is the Lord of the whole world, in
the name of Christ and by His Holy Spirit, has not cast off mankind but has suited His
providence to the difference of seasons: at first giving to Adam himself paradise for an
habitation of pleasure, and afterwards giving a command on account of providence, and
casting out the offender justly, but through His goodness not utterly casting him off, but
instructing his posterity in succeeding ages after various manners; on whose account, in the
conclusion of the world, He has sent His Son to become man for man’s sake, and to undergo
all human passions without sin. Him, therefore, let the priest even now call upon in baptism,
and let him say: Look down from heaven, and sanctify this water, and give it grace and
power, that so he that is to be baptized, according to the command of Thy Christ, may be
crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and may be buried with Him, and may rise with
Him to the adoption which is in Him, that he may be dead to sin and live to righteousness.
And after this, when he has baptized him in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, he shall anoint him with ointment, and shall add as follows:—</p>
<note type="footnote">1408 One V. ms. has “Son” instead of “God.” Cotelerius remarks that this change was made in the interests
of orthodoxy; for the expression “only begotten God” had become common with the Arians. [Comp. John i.
18., where the most weighty ancient authorities read μονογενὴς θεός instead of ὁ μονογενὴς υιός; see Revised
Version, margins in loco.—R.]</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="1051"/>
<head>A THANKSGIVING CONCERNING THE MYSTICAL OINTMENT.</head>
<p>XLIV. O Lord God, who art without generation, and without a superior, the Lord of
the whole world, who hast scattered the sweet odour of the knowledge of the Gospel among
all nations, do Thou grant at this time that this ointment may be efficacious upon him that
is baptized, that so the sweet odour of Thy Christ may continue upon him firm and fixed;
and that now he has died with Him, he may arise and live with Him. Let him say these and
the like things, for this is the efficacy of the laying on of hands on every one; for unless there
be such a recital made by a pious priest over every one of these, the candidate for baptism
does only descend into the water as do the Jews, and he only puts off the filth of the body,
not the filth of the soul. After this let him stand up, and pray that prayer which the Lord
taught us. But, of necessity, he who is risen again ought to stand up and pray, because he
that is raised up stands upright. Let him, therefore, who has been dead with Christ, and is
raised up with Him, stand up. But let him pray towards the east.1409 For this also is written
in the second book of the Chronicles, that after the temple of the Lord was finished by King
Solomon, in the very feast of dedication the priests and the Levites and the singers stood up
towards the east, praising and thanking God with cymbals and psalteries, and saying, “Praise
the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.”1410</p>
</div>

watchful, an unerring knowledge, the influence of the Holy Ghost for the obtaining and
assured enjoying of the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom1411 glory be to Thee, in the

death, the second, ordained by me Peter.1414 Of Ephesus, Timotheus, ordained by Paul; and
John, by me John. Of Smyrna, Aristo the first; after whom Stratæas the son of Lois;1415 and
the third Aristo. Of Pergamus, Gaius. Of Philadelphia, Demetrius, by me. Of Cenchrea,
Lucius, by Paul. Of Crete, Titus. Of Athens, Dionysius. Of Tripoli in Phoenicia, Marathones.
Of Laodicea in Phrygia, Archippus.1416 Of Colossæ, Philemon.1417 Of Borea in Macedonia,
Onesimus, once the servant of Philemon.1418 Of the churches of Galatia, Crescens.1419 Of
the parishes of Asia, Aquila and Nicetas. Of the church of Æginæ, Crispus. These are the
bishops who are entrusted by us with the parishes in the Lord; whose doctrine keep ye always
in mind, and observe our words. And may the Lord be with you now, and to endless ages,
as Himself said to us when He was about to be taken up to His own God and Father. For

<head>GENERAL NOTICE</head>
<p>Comparing the Teaching with chapters xxv. and xxvi. of these Constitutions, it seems
to me that the nature of the eucharistic (thanksgiving) prayers becomes apparent. They
presuppose the formulas to be found in the eighth book of the Constitutions,1427 and are
such instructions as were imparted only to catechumens; the part peculiar to presbyters being
withheld, of course, as esoteric mysteries, until further knowledge was canonically appropriate.
See Elucidation IV. vol. vi. p. 236; and in this volume, Elucidation I. p. 382. The Bryennios
ms. is cleared from nearly all difficulties by Dr. Riddle’s lucid notes, when compared with
corresponding passages in the Constitutions, or illustrated by such as are supplementary.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>ON WHOSE ACCOUNT THE POWERS OF MIRACLES ARE PERFORMED.</head>
<p>I. Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour, delivered to us the great mystery of godliness, and
called both Jews and Gentiles to the acknowledgment of the one and only1428 true God His
Father,1429 as Himself somewhere says, when He was giving thanks for the salvation of those
that had believed, “I have manifested Thy name to men, I have finished the work Thou
gavest me;”1430 and said concerning us to His Father, “Holy Father, although the world has
not known Thee, yet have I known Thee; and these have known Thee.”1431 With good
reason did He say to all of us together, when we were perfected concerning those gifts which
were given from Him by the Spirit: “Now these signs shall follow them that have believed
in my name: they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them: they shall lay
their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”1432 These gifts were first bestowed on us
the apostles when we were about to preach the Gospel to every creature, and afterwards
were of necessity afforded to those who had by our means believed; not for the advantage
of those who perform them, but for the conviction of the unbelievers, that those whom the
word did not persuade, the power of signs might put to shame: for signs are not for us who
believe, but for the unbelievers, both for the Jews and Gentiles. For neither is it any profit
to us to cast out demons, but to those who are so cleansed by the power of the Lord; as the
Lord1433 Himself somewhere instructs us, and shows, saying: “Rejoice ye, not because the
spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.”1434
Since the former is done by His power, but this by our good disposition and diligence, yet
(it is manifest) by His assistance. It is not therefore necessary that every one of the faithful
should cast out demons, or raise the dead, or speak with tongues; but such a one only who
is vouchsafed this gift, for some cause which may be advantage to the salvation of the unbelievers,
who are often put to shame, not with the demonstration of the world, but by the
power of the signs; that is, such as are worthy of salvation: for all the ungodly are not affected
by wonders; and hereof God Himself is a witness, as when He says in the law: “With other
tongues will I speak to this people, and with other lips, and yet will they by no means be-

lieve.”1435 For neither did the Egyptians believe in God, when Moses had done so many
signs and wonders;1436 nor did the multitude of the Jews believe in Christ, as they believed
Moses, who yet had healed every sickness and every disease among them.1437 Nor were the
former shamed by the rod which was turned into a living serpent, nor by the hand which
was made white with leprosy, nor by the river Nile turned into blood; nor the latter by the
blind who recovered their sight, nor by the lame who walked, nor by the dead who were
raised.1438 The one was resisted by Jannes and Jambres, the other by Annas and Caiaphas.1439
Thus signs do not shame all into belief, but only those of a good disposition; for whose sake
also it is that God is pleased, as a wise steward of a family, to appoint miracles to be wrought,
not by the power of men, but by His own will. Now we say these things, that those who have
received such gifts may not exalt themselves against those who have not received them; such
gifts, we mean, as are for the working of miracles. For otherwise there is no man who has
believed in God through Christ,1440 that has not received some spiritual gift: for this very
thing, having been delivered from the impiety of polytheism, and having believed in God
the Father through Christ,1441 this is a gift of God. And the having cast off the veil of Judaism,
and having believed that, by the good pleasure of God, His only begotten Son, who was before
all ages,1442 was in the last time born of a virgin,1443 without the company of a man, and
that He lived as a man, yet without sin, and fulfilled all that righteousness which is of the
law; and that, by the permission of God, He who was God the Word endured the cross, and
despised the shame; and that He died, and was buried, and rose within three days; and that
after His resurrection, having continued forty days with His apostles, and completed His
whole constitutions, He was taken up in their sight to His God and Father, who sent Him:
he who has believed these things, not at random and irrationally, but with judgment and
full assurance, has received the gift of God. So also has He who is delivered from every
heresy. Let not, therefore, any one that works signs and wonders judge any one of the
faithful who is not vouchsafed the same: for the gifts of God which are bestowed by Him
through Christ are various; and one man receives one gift, and another another. For perhaps

one has the word of wisdom, and another the word of knowledge;1444 another, discerning
of spirits; another, foreknowledge of things to come; another, the word of teaching; another,
long-suffering; another, continence according to the law: for even Moses, the man of God,
when he wrought signs in Egypt, did not exalt himself against his equals: and when he was
called a god, he did not arrogantly despise his own prophet Aaron.1445 Nor did Joshua the
son of Nun, who was the leader of the people after him, though in the war with the Jebusites
he had made the sun stand still over against Gibeon, and the moon over against the valley
of Ajalon,1446 because the day was not long enough for their victory, insult over Phineas or
Caleb. Nor did Samuel, who had done so many surprising things, disregard David the beloved
of God: yet they were both prophets, and the one was high priest, and the other was king.
And when there were only seven thousand holy men in Israel who had not bowed the knee
to Baal,1447 Elijah alone among them, and his disciple Elisha, were workers of miracles. Yet
neither did Elijah despise Obadiah the steward, who feared God, but wrought no signs; nor
did Elisha despise his own disciple when he trembled at the enemies.1448 Moreover, neither
did the wise Daniel who was twice delivered from the mouths of the lions, nor the three
children who were delivered from the furnace of fire,1449 despise the rest of their fellow-Israelites:
for they knew that they had not escaped these terrible miseries by their own might;
but by the power of God did they both work miracles, and were delivered from miseries.
Wherefore let none of you exalt himself against his brother, though he be a prophet, or
though he be a worker of miracles: for if it happens that there be no longer an unbeliever,
all the power of signs will thenceforwards be superfluous. For to be pious is from any one’s
good disposition; but to work wonders is from the power of Him that works them by us:
the first of which respects ourselves; but the second respects God that works them, for the
reasons which we have already mentioned. Wherefore neither let a king despise his officers
that are under him, nor the rulers those who are subject. For where there are none to be
ruled over, rulers are superfluous; and where there are no officers, the kingdom will not
stand. Moreover, let not a bishop be exalted against his deacons and presbyters, nor the
presbyters against the people: for the subsistence of the congregation depends on each other.
For the bishops and the presbyters are the priests with relation to the people; and the laity
are the laity with relation to the clergy. And to be a Christian is in our own power; but to
be an apostle, or a bishop, or in any other such office, is not in our own power, but at the

<head>CONCERNING UNWORTHY BISHOPS AND PRESBYTERS.</head>
<p>II. We add, in the next place, that neither is every one that prophesies holy, nor every
one that casts out devils religious: for even Balaam the son of Beor the prophet did prophesy,
1450 though he was himself ungodly; as also did Caiaphas, the falsely-named high
priest.1451 Nay, the devil foretells many things, and the demons, about Him; and yet for all
that, there is not a spark of piety in them: for they are oppressed with ignorance, by reason
of their voluntary wickedness. It is manifest, therefore, that the ungodly, although they
prophesy, do not by their prophesying cover their own impiety; nor will those who cast out
demons be sanctified by the demons being made subject to them: for they only mock one
another, as they do who play childish tricks for mirth, and destroy those who give heed to
them. For neither is a wicked king any longer a king, but a tyrant; nor is a bishop oppressed
with ignorance or an evil disposition a bishop, but falsely so called, being not one sent out
by God, but by men, as Ananiah and Samoeah in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah and Achiah the
false prophets in Babylon.1452 And indeed Balaam the prophet, when he had corrupted Israel
by Baal-peor, suffered punishment;1453 and Caiaphas at last was his own murderer; and the
sons of Sceva, endeavouring to cast out demons, were wounded by them, and fled away in
an unseemly manner;1454 and the kings of Israel and of Judah, when they became impious,
suffered all sorts of punishments. It is therefore evident how bishops and presbyters, also
falsely so called, will not escape the judgment of God. For it will be said to them even now:
“O ye priests that despise my name,1455 I will deliver you up to the slaughter, as I did
Zedekiah and Achiah, whom the king of Babylon fried in a frying-pan,” as says Jeremiah
the prophet.1456 We say these things, not in contempt of true prophecies, for we know that
they are wrought in holy men by the inspiration of God, but to put a stop to the boldness
of vainglorious men; and add this withal, that from such as these God takes away His grace:
for “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”1457 Now Silas and Agabus
prophesied in our times;1458 yet did they not equal themselves to the apostles, nor did they

Of old, Miriam the sister of Moses and Aaron,1459 and after her Deborah,1460 and after
these Huldah1461 and Judith1462—the former under Josiah, the latter under Darius. The
mother of the Lord did also prophesy, and her kinswoman Elisabeth, and Anna;1463 and in
our time the daughters of Philip;1464 yet were not these elated against their husbands, but
preserved their own measures.1465 Wherefore if among you also there be a man or a woman,
and such a one obtains any gift, let him be humble, that God may be pleased with him. For
says He: “Upon whom will I look, but upon him that is humble and quiet, and trembles at
my words?”1466</p>

SUNDAYS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>THAT TO MAKE CONSTITUTIONS ABOUT THE OFFICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE CHURCHES IS
OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE.</head>
<p>III. We have now finished the first part of this discourse concerning gifts, whatever they
be, which God has bestowed upon men according to His own will; and how He rebuked the
ways of those who either attempted to speak lies, or were moved by the spirit of the adversary;
and that God often employed the wicked1467 for prophecy and the performance of wonders.
But now our discourse hastens as to the principal part, that is, the constitution of ecclesiastical
affairs, that so, when ye have learned this constitution from us, ye who are ordained
bishops by us at the command of Christ, may perform all things according to the commands
delivered you, knowing that he that heareth us heareth Christ, and he that heareth Christ
heareth His God and Father,1468 to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>CONCERNING ORDINATIONS.</head>
<p>IV. Wherefore we, the twelve apostles of the Lord, who are now together, give you in
charge those divine constitutions concerning every ecclesiastical form, there being present
with us Paul the chosen vessel, our fellow-apostle, and James the bishop, and the rest of the
presbyters, and the seven deacons.1469 In the first place, therefore, I Peter say,1470 that a
bishop to be ordained is to be, as we have already, all of us, appointed, unblameable in all
things, a select person,1471 chosen by the whole people, who, when he is named and approved,
let the people assemble, with the presbytery and bishops that are present, on the Lord’s day,
and let them give their consent. And let the principal of the bishops ask the presbytery and
people whether this be the person whom they desire for their ruler. And if they give their consent,
let him ask further whether he has a good testimony from all men as to his worthiness for so
great and glorious an authority; whether all things relating to his piety towards God be right;
<note type="footnote">1467 We have adopted the reading of one V. ms., ἀπεχαρήσατο. It means more than is in the text—that God
used the wicked in a way in which they would not be naturally used; lit., “abused,” or “misused.” The other mss.
and the Coptic read ἀπεχαρίσατο, “gave His gifts to the wicked for prophecy.” Whiston has tried to make sense
by giving a new meaning to ἀπεχαρίσατο, “taking away His grace from the wicked.”</note>

“Peter, the chief of the apostles, proclaimed the Gospel to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithynia, and finally
in Rome, where he was crucified by the prefect in the reign of Nero, and where also he is buried.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1470 From this to the end of ch. xxvi., only small portions of what is now in the received text occur in the
Coptic version. The Oxford ms. is also deficient. It has only a portion of the fifth, nothing of ch. vi. to xvi., and
only a single sentence in ch. xxii. The portions in Coptic are printed in italics.</note>

whether justice towards men has been observed by him; whether the affairs of his family have
been well ordered by him; whether he has been unblameable in the course of his life. And if
all the assembly together do according to truth, and not according to prejudice, witness that
he is such a one, let them the third time, as before God the Judge, and Christ, the Holy Ghost
being also present, as well as all the holy and ministering spirits, ask again whether he be
truly worthy of this ministry, that so “in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may
be established.”1472 And if they agree the third time that he is worthy, let them all be demanded
their vote; and when they all give it willingly, let them be heard. And silence being made, let
one of the principal bishops, together with two others, stand near to the altar, the rest of the
bishops and presbyters praying silently, and the deacons holding the divine Gospels open upon
the head of him that is to be ordained, and say to God thus1473:—</p>

which is the true life; and deliver them from all ungodliness, and give no place to the adversary
against them; “and cleanse them from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and dwell in

<p>VIII. Thou who hast formerly said by Thy holy prophets to those that be initiated, “Wash
ye, become clean,”1490 and hast appointed spiritual regeneration by Christ, do Thou now
also look down upon these that are baptized, and bless them, and sanctify them, and prepare

spiritual mysteries, of being gathered together with those that are saved through Christ our

And let the deacon say: Go out, ye that are preparing for illumination. And after that let

<p>IX. Almighty, eternal God, Lord of the whole world, the Creator and Governor of all
things, who hast exhibited man as the ornament of the world through Christ, and didst give
him a law both naturally implanted and written, that he might live according to law, as a
rational creature; and when he had sinned, Thou gavest him Thy goodness as a pledge in
order to his repentance: Look down upon these persons who have bended the neck of their
soul and body to Thee; for Thou desirest not the death of a sinner, but his repentance, that
he turn from his wicked way, and live.1500 Thou who didst accept the repentance of the
Ninevites, who willest that all men be saved, and come to the acknowledgment of the
truth;1501 who didst accept of that son who had consumed his substance in riotous living,1502
with the bowels of a father, on account of his repentance; do Thou now accept of the repentance

preserve and keep it unshaken, and free from the waves of this life, until the end of the world, as founded upon a rock; and for the holy parish
in this place, that the Lord of the whole world may vouchsafe us without failure to follow after His heavenly hope, and without ceasing to pay

And let us pray for our bishop James,1504 and his parishes; let us pray for our bishop Clement, and his parishes; let us pray for our bishop
Euodius, and his parishes; let us pray for our bishop Annianus, and his parishes: that the compassionate God may grant them to continue in His

Let us pray for all the deacons and ministers in Christ, that the Lord may grant them an unblameable ministration. Let us pray for the readers,
singers, virgins, widows, and orphans. Let us pray for those that are in marriage and in child-bearing, that the Lord may have mercy upon them
all. Let us pray for the eunuchs who walk holily. Let us pray for those in a state of continence and piety. Let us pray for those that bear fruit in
the holy Church, and give alms to the needy. And let us pray for those who offer sacrifices and oblations to the Lord our God, that God, the
fountain of all goodness, may recompense them with His heavenly gifts, and “give them in this world an hundredfold, and in the world to come
life everlasting;”1505 and bestow upon them for their temporal things, those that are eternal; for earthly things, those that are heavenly. Let us

<head>THE FORM OF PRAYER FOR THE FAITHFUL.</head>
<p>XI. O Lord Almighty, the Most High, who dwellest on high, the Holy One, that restest
among the saints, without beginning, the Only Potentate, who hast given to us by Christ
the preaching of knowledge, to the acknowledgment of Thy glory and of Thy name, which
He has made known to us, for our comprehension, do Thou now also look down through
Him upon this Thy flock, and deliver it from all ignorance and wicked practice, and grant
that we may fear Thee in earnest, and love Thee with affection, and have a due reverence of
Thy glory. Be gracious and merciful to them, and hearken to them when they pray unto
Thee; and keep them, that they may be unmoveable, unblameable, and unreprovable, that
they may be holy in body and spirit, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that
they may be complete, and none of them may be defective or imperfect. O our support, our
powerful God, who dost not accept persons, be Thou the assister of this Thy people,1506
which Thou hast redeemed with the precious blood of Thy Christ; be Thou their protector,
aider, provider, and guardian, their strong wall of defence, their bulwark and security. For
“none can snatch out of Thy hand:”1507 for there is no other God like Thee; for on Thee is
our reliance. “Sanctify them by Thy truth: for Thy word is truth.”1508 Thou who dost
nothing for favour, Thou whom none can deceive, deliver them from every sickness, and
every disease, and every offence, every injury and deceit, “from fear of the enemy, from the
dart that flieth in the day, from the mischief that walketh about in darkness;”1509 and
vouchsafe them that everlasting life which is in Christ Thy only begotten Son, our God and
Saviour, through whom glory and worship be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit, now and always,
and for ever and ever. Amen. And after this let the deacon say, Let us attend. And let the

<head>THE CONSTITUTION OF JAMES THE BROTHER OF JOHN, THE SON OF ZEBEDEE.</head>
<p>XII. And I James,1512 the brother of John, the son of Zebedee, say, that the deacon shall
immediately say, Let none of the catechumens, let none of the hearers, let none of the unbelievers,
let none of the heterodox, stay here. You who have prayed the foregoing prayer, depart.
1513 Let the mothers receive their children; let no one have anything against any one; let
no one come in hypocrisy; let us stand upright before the Lord with fear and trembling, to offer.
When this is done, let the deacons bring the gifts to the bishop at the altar; and let the presbyters
stand on his right hand, and on his left, as disciples stand before their Master. But let two of
the deacons, on each side of the altar, hold a fan, made up of thin membranes, or of the
feathers of the peacock, or of fine cloth, and let them silently drive away the small animals
that fly about, that they may not come near to the cups. Let the high priest, therefore, together
with the priests, pray1514 by himself; and let him put on his shining garment, and stand at
the altar, and make the sign of the cross upon his forehead with his hand,1515 and say: The
grace of Almighty God, and the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost, be with you all. And let all with one voice say: And with thy spirit. The high priest:
Lift up your mind. All the people: We lift it up unto the Lord. The high priest: Let us give
thanks to the Lord. All the people: It is meet and right so to do. Then let the high priest say:
It is very meet and right before all things to sing an hymn to Thee, who art the true God,
who art before all beings, “from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named;”1516

who only art unbegotten, and without beginning, and without a ruler, and without a master;
who standest in need of nothing; who art the bestower of everything that is good; who art
beyond all cause and generation; who art alway and immutably the same; from whom all
things came into being, as from their proper original. For Thou art eternal knowledge,
everlasting sight, unbegotten hearing, untaught wisdom, the first by nature, and the measure
of being, and beyond all number; who didst bring all things out of nothing into being by
Thy only begotten Son, but didst beget Him before all ages by Thy will, Thy power, and Thy
goodness, without any instrument, the only begotten Son, God the Word, the living Wisdom,
“the First-born of every creature, the angel of Thy Great Counsel,”1517 and Thy High Priest,
but the King and Lord of every intellectual and sensible nature, who was before all things,
by whom were all things. For Thou, O eternal God, didst make all things by Him, and
through Him it is that Thou vouchsafest Thy suitable providence over the whole world; for
by the very same that Thou bestowedst being, didst Thou also bestow well-being: the God
and Father of Thy only begotten Son, who by Him didst make before all things the cherubim
and the seraphim, the æons and hosts, the powers and authorities, the principalities and
thrones, the archangels and angels; and after all these, didst by Him make this visible world,
and all things that are therein. For Thou art He who didst frame the heaven as an arch, and
“stretch it out like the covering of a tent,”1518 and didst found the earth upon nothing by
Thy mere will; who didst fix the firmament, and prepare the night and the day; who didst
bring the light out of Thy treasures, and on its departure didst bring on darkness, for the
rest of the living creatures that move up and down in the world; who didst appoint the sun
in heaven to rule over the day, and the moon to rule over the night, and didst inscribe in
heaven the choir of stars to praise Thy glorious majesty; who didst make the water for drink
and for cleansing, the air in which we live for respiration and the affording of sounds, by
the means of the tongue, which strikes the air, and the hearings which co-operates therewith,
so as to perceive speech when it is received by it, and falls upon it; who madest fire for our
consolation in darkness, for the supply of our want, and that we might be warmed and enlightened
by it; who didst separate the great sea from the land, and didst render the former
navigable and the latter fit for walking, and didst replenish the former with small and great
living creatures, and filledst the latter with the same, both tame and wild; didst furnish it
with various plants, and crown it with herbs, and beautify it with flowers, and enrich it with
seeds; who didst ordain the great deep, and on every side madest a mighty cavity for it,
which contains seas of salt waters heaped together,1519 yet didst Thou every way bound
them with barriers of the smallest sand;1520 who sometimes dost raise it to the height of

mountains by the winds, and sometimes dost smooth it into a plain; sometimes dost enrage
it with a tempest, and sometimes dost still it with a calm, that it may be easy to seafaring
men in their voyages; who didst encompass this world, which was made by Thee through
Christ, with rivers, and water it with currents, and moisten it with springs that never fail,
and didst bind it round with mountains for the immoveable and secure consistence of the
earth: for Thou hast replenished Thy world, and adorned it with sweet-smelling and with
healing herbs, with many and various living creatures, strong and weak, for food and for
labour, tame and wild; with the noises of creeping things, the sounds of various sorts of
flying creatures; with the circuits of the years, the numbers of months and days, the order
of the seasons, the courses of the rainy clouds, for the production of the fruits and the support
of living creatures. Thou hast also appointed the station of the winds, which blow when
commanded by Thee, and the multitude of the plants and herbs. And Thou hast not only
created the world itself, but hast also made man for a citizen of the world, exhibiting him
as the ornament of the world; for Thou didst say to Thy Wisdom: “Let us make man according
to our image, and according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowls of the heaven.”1521 Wherefore also Thou hast made him of
an immortal soul and of a body liable to dissolution—the former out of nothing, the latter
out of the four elements—and hast given him as to his soul rational knowledge, the discerning
of piety and impiety, and the observation of right and wrong; and as to his body, Thou hast
granted him five senses and progressive motion: for Thou, O God Almighty, didst by Thy
Christ plant a paradise in Eden,1522 in the east, adorned with all plants fit for food, and didst
introduce him into it, as into a rich banquet. And when Thou madest him, Thou gavest him
a law implanted within him, that so he might have at home and within himself the seeds of
divine knowledge; and when Thou hadst brought him into the paradise of pleasure, Thou
allowedst him the privilege of enjoying all things, only forbidding the tasting of one tree, in
hopes of greater blessings; that in case he would keep that command, he might receive the
reward of it, which was immortality. But when he neglected that command, and tasted of
the forbidden fruit, by the seduction of the serpent and the counsel of his wife, Thou didst
justly cast him out of paradise.</p>
<p>Yet of Thy goodness Thou didst not overlook him, nor suffer him to perish utterly, for
he was Thy creature; but Thou didst subject the whole creation to him, and didst grant him
liberty to procure himself food by his own sweat and labours, whilst Thou didst cause all
the fruits of the earth to spring up, to grow, and to ripen. But when Thou hadst laid him
asleep for a while, Thou didst with an oath call him to a restoration again, didst loose the
bond of death, and promise him life after the resurrection. And not this only; but when

Thou hadst increased his posterity to an innumerable multitude, those that continued with
Thee Thou didst glorify, and those who did apostatize from Thee Thou didst punish. And
while Thou didst accept of the sacrifice of Abel1523 as of an holy person, Thou didst reject
the gift of Cain, the murderer of his brother, as of an abhorred wretch. And besides these,
Thou didst accept of Seth and Enos,1524 and didst translate Enoch:1525 for Thou art the
Creator of men, and the giver of life, and the supplier of want, and the giver of laws, and
the rewarder of those that observe them, and the avenger of those that transgress them; who
didst bring the great flood upon the world by reason of the multitude of the ungodly,1526
and didst deliver righteous Noah from that flood by an ark,1527 with eight souls, the end of
the foregoing generations, and the beginning of those that were to come; who didst kindle
a fearful fire against the five cities of Sodom, and “didst turn a fruitful land into a salt lake
for the wickedness of them that dwelt therein,”1528 but didst snatch holy Lot out of the
conflagration. Thou art He who didst deliver Abraham from the impiety of his fore-fathers,
and didst appoint him to be the heir of the world, and didst discover to him Thy Christ;
who didst aforehand ordain Melchisedec an high priest for Thy worship;1529 who didst
render Thy patient servant Job the conqueror of that serpent who is the patron of wickedness;
who madest Isaac the son of the promise, and Jacob the father of twelve sons, and didst increase
his posterity to a multitude, and bring him into Egypt with seventy-five souls.1530
Thou, O Lord, didst not overlook Joseph, but grantedst him, as a reward of his chastity for
Thy sake, the government over the Egyptians. Thou, O Lord, didst not overlook the Hebrews
when they were afflicted by the Egyptians, on account of the promises made unto their
fathers; but Thou didst deliver them and punish the Egyptians.1531 And when men had
corrupted the law of nature, and had sometimes esteemed the creation the effect of chance,
and sometimes honoured it more than they ought, and equalled it to the God of the universe,
Thou didst not, however, suffer them to go astray, but didst raise up Thy holy servant Moses,
and by him didst give the written law for the assistance of the law of nature,1532 and didst
show that the creation was Thy work, and didst banish away the error of polytheism. Thou

when they sinned, and receive them again when they returned to Thee. Thou didst punish
the Egyptians with a judgment of ten plagues, and didst divide the sea, and bring the Israelites
through it, and drown and destroy the Egyptians who pursued after them. Thou didst
sweeten the bitter water with wood; Thou didst bring water out of the rock of stone; Thou
didst rain manna from heaven, and quails, as meat out of the air; Thou didst afford them a
pillar of fire by night to give them light, and a pillar of a cloud by day to overshadow them
from the heat; Thou didst declare Joshua to be the general of the army, and didst overthrow
the seven nations of Canaan by him;1533 Thou didst divide Jordan, and dry up the rivers of
Etham;1534 Thou didst overthrow walls without instruments or the hand of man.1535 For
all these things, glory be to Thee, O Lord Almighty. Thee do the innumerable hosts of angels,
archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, authorities, and powers, Thine everlasting
armies, adore. The cherubim and the six-winged seraphim, with twain covering their feet,
with twain their heads, and with twain flying,1536 say, together with thousand thousands of

exalted for ever. Holy also is Thy only begotten Son our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, who
in all things ministered to His God and Father, both in Thy various creation and Thy suitable
providence, and has not overlooked lost mankind. But after the law of nature, after the exhortations
in the positive law, after the prophetical reproofs and the government of the angels,

mind the memory of the flood, the burning of Sodom, the plagues of the Egyptians, and the
slaughters of the inhabitant of Palestine, and being just ready to perish universally after an
unparalleled manner, He was pleased by Thy good will to become man, who was man’s
Creator; to be under the laws, who was the Legislator; to be a sacrifice, who was an High
Priest; to be a sheep, who was the Shepherd. And He appeased Thee, His God and Father,

His goodness;”1539 “He manifested His name to those that knew it not;”1540 He drave away
ignorance; He revived piety, and fulfilled Thy will; He finished the work which Thou gavest
Him to do; and when He had set all these things right, He was seized by the hands of the
ungodly, of the high priests and priests, falsely so called, and of the disobedient people, by
the betraying of him who was possessed of wickedness as with a confirmed disease; He
suffered many things from them, and endured all sorts of ignominy by Thy permission; He
was delivered to Pilate the governor, and He that was the Judge was judged, and He that
was the Saviour was condemned; He that was impassible was nailed to the cross, and He
who was by nature immortal died, and He that is the giver of life was buried, that He might
loose those for whose sake He came from suffering and death, and might break the bonds
of the devil, and deliver mankind from his deceit. He arose from the dead the third day; and
when He had continued with His disciples forty days, He was taken up into the heavens,
and is sat down on the right hand of Thee, who art His God and Father.</p>
<p>Being mindful, therefore, of those things that He endured for our sakes, we give Thee
thanks, O God Almighty, not in such a manner as we ought, but as we are able, and fulfil
His constitution: “For in the same night that He was betrayed, He took bread”1541 in His
holy and undefiled hands, and, looking up to Thee His God and Father, “He brake it, and
gave it to His disciples, saying, This is the mystery of the new covenant: take of it, and eat.
This is my body, which is broken for many, for the remission of sins.”1542 In like manner
also “He took the cup,” and mixed it of wine and water, and sanctified it, and delivered it
to them, saying: “Drink ye all of this; for this is my blood which is shed for many, for the
remission of sins: do this in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink
this cup, ye do show forth my death until I come.” Being mindful, therefore, of His passion,
and death, and resurrection from the dead, and return into the heavens, and His future
second appearing, wherein He is to come with glory and power to judge the quick and the
dead, and to recompense to every one according to his works, we offer to Thee, our King
and our God, according to His constitution, this bread and this cup, giving Thee thanks,

through Him, that Thou hast thought us worthy to stand before Thee, and to sacrifice to
Thee; and we beseech Thee that Thou wilt mercifully look down upon these gifts which are
here set before Thee, O Thou God, who standest in need of none of our offerings. And do
Thou accept them, to the honour of Thy Christ, and send down upon this sacrifice Thine
Holy Spirit, the Witness of the Lord Jesus’ sufferings, that He may show this bread to be the
body of Thy Christ, and the cup to be the blood of Thy Christ, that those who are partakers
thereof may be strengthened for piety, may obtain the remission of their sins, may be delivered
from the devil and his deceit, may be filled with the Holy Ghost, may be made worthy
of Thy Christ, and may obtain eternal life upon Thy reconciliation to them, O Lord Almighty.
We further pray unto Thee, O Lord, for thy holy Church spread from one end of the world
to another, which Thou hast purchased with the precious blood of Thy Christ, that Thou
wilt preserve it unshaken and free from disturbance until the end of the world; for every
episcopate who rightly divides the word of truth. We further pray to Thee for me, who am
nothing, who offer to Thee, for the whole presbytery, for the deacons and all the clergy, that
Thou wilt make them wise, and replenish them with the Holy Spirit. We further pray to
Thee, O Lord, “for the king and all in authority,”1543 for the whole army, that they may be
peaceable towards us, that so, leading the whole time of our life in quietness and unanimity,
we may glorify Thee through Jesus Christ, who is our hope. We further offer to Thee also
for all those holy persons who have pleased Thee from the beginning of the world—patriarch,
prophets, righteous men, apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops, presbyters, deacons, subdeacons,
readers, singers, virgins, widows, and lay persons, with all whose names Thou
knowest. We further offer to Thee for this people, that Thou wilt render them, to the praise
of Thy Christ, “a royal priesthood and an holy nation;”1544 for those that are in virginity
and purity; for the widows of the Church; for those in honourable marriage and childbearing;
for the infants of Thy people, that Thou wilt not permit any of us to “become castaways.”
We further beseech Thee also for this city and its inhabitants; for those that are sick;
for those in bitter servitude; for those in banishments; for those in prison; for those that
travel by water or by land; that Thou, the helper and assister of all men, wilt be their supporter.
We further also beseech Thee for those that hate us and persecute us for Thy name’s
sake; for those that are without, and wander out of the way; that Thou wilt convert them to
goodness, and pacify their anger. We further also beseech Thee for the catechumens of the
Church, and for those that are vexed by the adversary, and for our brethren the penitents,
that Thou wilt perfect the first in the faith, that Thou wilt deliver the second from the energy
of the evil one, and that Thou wilt accept the repentance of the last, and forgive both them
and us our offences. We further offer to Thee also for the good temperature of the air, and

gather us together in the kingdom of Thy Christ, the God of all sensible and intelligent

hand upon his head, in the presence of the presbyters and deacons,1560 and pray, saying: O
Lord Almighty, our God, who hast created all things by Christ, and dost in like manner take
care of the whole world by Him; for He who had power to make different creatures, has also
power to take care of them, according to their different natures; on which account, O God,
Thou takest care of immortal beings by bare preservation, but of those that are mortal by
succession—of the soul by the provision of laws, of the body by the supply of its wants. Do
Thou therefore now also look down upon Thy holy Church, and increase the same, and
multiply those that preside in it, and grant them power, that they may labour both in word
and work for the edification of Thy people. Do Thou now also look down upon this Thy
servant, who is put into the presbytery by the vote and determination of the whole clergy;
and do Thou replenish him with the Spirit of grace and counsel, to assist and govern Thy
people with a pure heart, in the same manner as Thou didst look down upon Thy chosen
people, and didst command Moses to choose elders, whom Thou didst fill with Thy Spirit.1561
Do Thou also now, O Lord, grant this, and preserve in us the Spirit of Thy grace, that this
person, being filled with the gifts of healing and the word of teaching, may in meekness instruct
Thy people, and sincerely serve Thee with a pure mind and a willing soul, and may
fully discharge the holy ministrations for Thy people, through Thy Christ, with whom glory,

THE CLERGY.</head>
<p>XXVIII. Concerning1582 the canons I the same make a constitution. A bishop blesses,
but does not receive the blessing. He lays on hands, ordains, offers, receives the blessing
from bishops, but by no means from presbyters. A bishop deprives any clergyman who deserves
deprivation, excepting a bishop; for of himself he has not power to do that. A presbyter
blesses, but does not receive the blessing; yet does he receive the blessing from the bishop
or a fellow-presbyter. In like manner does he give it to a fellow-presbyter. He lays on hands,
but does not ordain; he does not deprive, yet does he separate those that are under him, if
they be liable to such a punishment. A deacon does not bless, does not give the blessing, but
receives it from the bishop and presbyter: he does not baptize, he does not offer; but when
a bishop or presbyter has offered, he distributes to the people, not as a priest, but as one that
ministers to the priests. But it is not lawful for any one of the other clergy to do the work of
a deacon. A deaconess does not bless, nor perform anything belonging to the office of
presbyters or deacons, but only is to keep the doors, and to minister to the presbyters in the
baptizing of women, on account of decency. A deacon separates a sub-deacon, a reader, a
singer, and a deaconess, if there be any occasion, in the absence of a presbyter. It is not
lawful for a sub-deacon to separate either one of the clergy or laity; nor for a reader, nor for
a singer, nor for a deaconess, for they are the ministers to the deacons.</p>

<head>CONCERNING THE BLESSING OF WATER AND OIL—THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTHIAS.</head>
<p>XXIX.1583 Concerning the water and the oil, I Matthias make a constitution. Let the
bishop bless the water, or the oil. But if he be not there, let the presbyter bless it, the deacon
standing by. But if the bishop be present, let the presbyter and deacon stand by, and let him
say thus: O Lord of hosts, the God of powers, the creator of the waters, and the supplier of
oil, who art compassionate, and a lover of mankind, who hast given water for drink and for
cleansing, and oil to give man a cheerful and joyful countenance;1584 do Thou now also
sanctify this water and this oil through Thy Christ, in the name of him or her that has offered
them, and grant them a power to restore health, to drive away diseases, to banish demons,
and to disperse all snares through Christ our hope, with whom glory, honour, and worship
be to Thee, and to the Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>THE SAME APOSTLE’S CONSTITUTION CONCERNING FIRST-FRUITS AND TITHES.</head>
<p>XXX. I1585 the same make a constitution in regard to first-fruits and tithes. Let all firstfruits
be brought to the bishop, and to the presbyters, and to the deacons,1586 for their
maintenance; but let all the tithe be for the maintenance of the rest of the clergy, and of the
virgins and widows, and of those under the trial of poverty. For the first-fruits belong to the
priests, and to those deacons that minister to them.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>THE SAME APOSTLE’S CONSTITUTIONS CONCERNING THE REMAINING OBLATIONS.</head>
<p>XXXI. I the same make a constitution in regard to remainders. Those eulogies which
remain at the mysteries, let the deacons distribute them among the clergy, according to the
mind of the bishop or the presbyters: to a bishop; four parts; to a presbyter, three1587 parts;
to a deacon, two1588 parts; and to the rest of the sub-deacons, or readers, or singers, or
deaconesses, one part. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, that every one be
honoured according to his dignity; for the Church is the school, not of confusion, but of
good order.</p>

<head>VARIOUS CANONS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE CONCERNING THOSE THAT OFFER THEMSELVES TO BE
BAPTIZED—WHOM WE ARE TO RECEIVE, AND WHOM TO REJECT.</head>
<p>XXXII. I also, Paul,1589 the least of the apostles, do make the following constitutions for
you, the bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, concerning canons. Those that first come to
the mystery of godliness, let them be brought to the bishop or to the presbyters by the deacons,
and let them be examined as to the causes wherefore they come to the word of the
Lord; and let those that bring them exactly inquire about their character, and give them
their testimony. Let their manners and their life be inquired into, and whether they be slaves
or freemen. And if any one be a slave, let him be asked who is his master. If he be slave to
one of the faithful, let his master be asked if he can give him a good character. If he cannot,
let him be rejected, until he show himself to be worthy to his master. But if he does give him
a good character, let him be admitted. But if he be household slave to an heathen, let him
be taught to please his master, that the word be not blasphemed. If, then, he have a wife, or
a woman hath an husband, let them be taught to be content with each other; but if they be
unmarried, let them learn not to commit fornication, but to enter into lawful marriage. But
if his master be one of the faithful, and knows that he is guilty of fornication, and yet does
not give him a wife, or to the woman an husband, let him be separated; but if anyone hath
a demon, let him indeed be taught piety, but not received into communion before he be
cleansed; yet if death be near, let him be received. If any one be a maintainer of harlots, let
him either leave off to prostitute women, or else let him be rejected. If a harlot come, let her
leave off whoredom, or else let her be rejected. If a maker of idols come, let him either leave
off his employment, or let him be rejected. If one belonging to the theatre1590 come,
whether it be man or woman, or charioteer, or dueller, or racer, or player of prizes, or
Olympic gamester, or one that plays on the pipe, on the lute, or on the harp at those games,
or a dancing-master or an huckster,1591 either let them leave off their employments, or let
them be rejected. If a soldier come, let him be taught to “do no injustice, to accuse no man
falsely, and to be content with his allotted wages:”1592 if he submit to those rules, let him
be received; but if he refuse them, let him be rejected. He that is guilty of sins not to be
named, a sodomite, an effeminate person, a magician, an enchanter, an astrologer, a diviner,
an user of magic verses, a juggler, a mountebank, one that makes amulets, a charmer, a
soothsayer, a fortune-teller, an observer of palmistry; he that, when he meets you, observes

defects in the eyes or feet of the birds or cats, or noises, or symbolical sounds: let these be
proved for some time, for this sort of wickedness is hard to be washed away; and if they
leave off those practices, let them be received; but if they will not agree to that, let them be
rejected. Let a concubine, who is slave to an unbeliever, and confines herself to her master
alone, be received;1593 but if she be incontinent with others, let her be rejected. If one of the
faithful hath a concubine, if she be a bond-servant, let him leave off that way, and marry in
a legal manner: if she be a free woman, let him marry her in a lawful manner; if he does not,
let him be rejected. Let him that follows the Gentile customs, or Jewish fables, either reform,
or let him be rejected. If any one follows the sports of the theatre, their huntings, or horseraces,
or combats, either let him leave them off, or let him be rejected. Let him who is to be
a catechumen be a catechumen for three years; but if any one be diligent, and has a goodwill
to his business, let him be admitted: for it is not the length of time, but the course of
life, that is judged. Let him that teaches, although he be one of the laity, yet, if he be skilful
in the word and grave in his manners, teach; for “they shall be all taught of God.”1594 Let
all the faithful, whether men or women, when they rise from sleep, before they go to work,
when they have washed themselves, pray; but if any catechetic instruction be held, let the
faithful person prefer the word of piety before his work. Let the faithful person, whether
man or woman, treat servants kindly, as we have ordained in the foregoing books, and have
taught in our epistles.1595</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<head>UPON WHICH DAYS SERVANTS ARE NOT TO WORK.</head>
<p>XXXIII. I Peter and Paul do make the following constitutions. Let the slaves work five
days; but on the Sabbath-day and the Lord’s day let them have leisure to go to church for
instruction in piety. We have said that the Sabbath is on account of the creation, and the
Lord’s day of the resurrection. Let slaves rest from their work all the great week, and that
which follows it—for the one in memory of the passion, and the other of the resurrection;
and there is need they should be instructed who it is that suffered and rose again, and who
it is permitted Him to suffer, and raised Him again. Let them have rest from their work on
the Ascension, because it was the conclusion of the dispensation by Christ. Let them rest at
Pentecost, because of the coming of the Holy Spirit, which was given to those that believed
in Christ. Let them rest on the festival of His birth, because on it the unexpected favour was
granted to men, that Jesus Christ, the Logos of God, should be born of the Virgin Mary,1596
for the salvation of the world.1597 Let them rest on the festival of Epiphany, because on it a

manifestation took place of the divinity of Christ, for the Father bore testimony to Him at
the baptism; and the Paraclete, in the form of a dove, pointed out to the bystanders Him to
whom testimony was borne. Let them rest on the days of the apostles: for they were appointed
your teachers to bring you to Christ, and made you worthy of the Spirit. Let them rest on
the day of the first1598 martyr Stephen, and of the other holy martyrs who preferred Christ
to their own life.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">    
<head>AT WHAT HOURS, AND WHY, WE ARE TO PRAY.</head>
<p>XXXIV. Offer up your prayers in the morning, at the third hour, the sixth, the ninth,
the evening, and at cock-crowing: in the morning, returning thanks that the Lord has sent
you light, that He has brought you past the night, and brought on the day; at the third hour,
because at that hour the Lord received the sentence of condemnation from Pilate; at the
sixth, because at that hour He was crucified;1599 at the ninth, because all things were in
commotion at the crucifixion of the Lord, as trembling at the bold attempt of the impious
Jews, and not bearing the injury offered to their Lord; in the evening, giving thanks that He
has given you the night to rest from the daily labours; at cock-crowing, because that hour
brings the good news of the coming on of the day for the operations proper for the light.
But if it be not possible to go to the church on account of the unbelievers, thou, O bishop,
shalt assemble them in a house, that a godly man may not enter into an assembly of the
ungodly. For it is not the place that sanctifies the man, but the man the place. And if the
ungodly possess the place, do thou avoid it, because it is profaned by them. For as holy
priests sanctify a place, so do the profane ones defile it. If it be not possible to assemble either
in the church or in a house, let every one by himself sing, and read, and pray, or two or three
together. For “where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them.”1600 Let not one of the faithful pray with a catechumen, no, not in the house: for
it is not reasonable that he who is admitted should be polluted with one not admitted. Let
not one of the godly pray with an heretic, no, not in the house. For “what fellowship hath
light with darkness?”1601 Let Christians, whether men or women, who have connections
with slaves, either leave them off, or let them be rejected.</p>

there that can worthily give Thee thanks for those things Thou hast given them to partake
of? The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and of all the saints, who madest all
things fruitful by Thy word, and didst command the earth to bring forth various fruits for
our rejoicing and our food; who hast given to the duller and more sheepish sort of creatures
juices—herbs to them that feed on herbs, and to some flesh, to others seeds, but to us corn,
as advantageous and proper food, and many other things—some for our necessities, some
for our health, and some for our pleasure. On all these accounts, therefore, art Thou worthy
of exalted hymns of praise for Thy beneficence by Christ, through whom1610 glory, honour,
and worship be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen. Concerning those that are at

<head>THE BIDDING PRAYER FOR THOSE DEPARTED.</head>
<p>XLI. Let us pray for our brethren that are at rest1611 in Christ, that God, the lover of
mankind, who has received his soul, may forgive him every sin, voluntary and involuntary,
and may be merciful and gracious to him, and give him his lot in the land of the pious that

art by nature immortal, and hast no end of Thy being, from whom every creature, whether
immortal or mortal, is derived; who didst make man a rational creature, the citizen of this
world, in his constitution mortal, and didst add the promise of a resurrection; who didst
not suffer Enoch and Elijah to taste of death: “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob, who art the God of them, not as of dead, but as of living persons: for the
souls of all men live with Thee, and the spirits of the righteous are in Thy hand, which no
torment can touch;”1612 for they are all sanctified under Thy hand: do Thou now also look

and cover them under Thy wings, and grant that they may “fight the good fight, and finish
their course, and keep the faith”1615 immutably, unblameably, and unreprovably, through

among others, that so you may be able to warn the unruly. Now the Scripture says, “The
men in power are passionate. But let them not drink wine, lest by drinking they forget wisdom,
and are not able to judge aright.”1622 Wherefore1623 both the presbyters and the deacons
are those of authority in the Church next to God Almighty and His beloved Son.1624
We say this, not they are not to drink at all, otherwise it would be to the reproach of what
God has made for cheerfulness, but that they be not disordered with wine. For the Scripture
does not say, Do not drink wine; but what says it? “Drink not wine to drunkenness;” and
again, “Thorns spring up in the hand of the drunkard.”1625 Nor do we say this only to those
of the clergy, but also to every lay Christian, upon whom the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
is called. For to them also it is said, “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath uneasiness?
who hath babbling? who hath red eyes? who hath wounds without cause? Do not these
things belong to those that tarry long at the wine, and that go to seek where drinking meetings
are?”1626</p>

<head>SEC. V.—ALL THE APOSTLES URGE THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ORDER OF THE
CHURCH.</head>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<head>THAT EVERY ONE OUGHT TO REMAIN IN THAT RANK WHEREIN HE IS PLACED, BUT NOT SNATCH
SUCH OFFICES TO HIMSELF WHICH ARE NOT ENTRUSTED TO HIM.</head>
<p>XLVI. Now this we all in common do charge you, that every one remain in that rank
which is appointed him, and do not transgress his proper bounds; for they are not ours, but
God’s. For says the Lord: “He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that heareth me, heareth
Him that sent me.” And, “He that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me,
despiseth Him that sent me.”1630 For if those things that are without life do observe good
order, as the night, the day, the sun, the moon, the stars, the elements, the seasons, the
months, the weeks, the days, and the hours, and are subservient to the uses appointed them,
according to that which is said, “Thou hast set them a bound which they shall not pass;”1631
and again, concerning the sea, “I have set bounds thereto, and have encompassed it with
bars and gates; and I said to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, and thou shalt go no farther;”1632
how much more ought ye not to venture to remove those things which we, according to
God’s will, have determined for you! But because many think this a small matter, and venture
to confound the orders, and to remove the ordination which belongs to them severally,
snatching to themselves dignities which were never given them, and allowing themselves
to bestow that authority in a tyrannical manner which they have not themselves, and thereby
provoke God to anger (as did the followers of Corah and King Uzziah,1633 who, having no
authority, usurped the high-priesthood without commission from God; and the former
were burnt with fire, and the latter was struck with a leprosy in his forehead); and provoke
Christ Jesus to anger, who has made this constitution; and also grieve the Holy Spirit, and
make void His testimony: therefore, foreknowing the danger that hangs over those who do
such things, and the neglect about the sacrifices and eucharistical offices which will arise
from their being impiously offered by those who ought not to offer them; who think the
honour of the high-priesthood, which is an imitation of the great High Priest Jesus Christ
our King, to be a matter of sport; we have found it necessary to give you warning in this
matter also. For some are already turned aside after their own vanity. We say that Moses
the servant of God (“to whom God spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend;”1634
to whom He said, “I know thee above all men;” to whom He spake directly, and not by obscure
methods, or dreams, or angels, or riddles),—this person, when he made constitutions

and divine laws, distinguished what things were to be performed by the high priests, what
by the priests, and what by the Levites; distributing to every one his proper and suitable office
in the divine service. And those things which are allotted for the high priests to do, those
might not be meddled with by the priests; and what things were allotted to the priests, the
Levites might not meddle with; but every one observed those ministrations which were
written down and appointed for them. And if any would meddle beyond the tradition, death
was his punishment. And Saul’s example does show this most plainly, who, thinking he
might offer sacrifice without the prophet and high priest Samuel,1635 drew upon himself a
sin and a curse without remedy. Nor did even his having anointed him king discourage the
prophet. But God showed the same by a more visible effect in the case of Uzziah,1636 when
He without delay exacted the punishment due to this transgression, and he that madly
coveted after the high-priesthood was rejected from his kingdom also. As to those things
that have happened amongst us, you yourselves are not ignorant of them. For ye know undoubtedly
that those that are by us named bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, were made
by prayer, and by the laying on of hands; and that by the difference of their names is showed
the difference of their employments. For not every one that will is ordained, as the case was
in that spurious and counterfeit priesthood of the calves under Jeroboam;1637 but he only
who is called of God. For if there were no rule or distinction of orders, it would suffice to
perform all the offices under one name. But being taught by the Lord the series of things,
we distributed the functions of the high-priesthood to the bishops, those of the priesthood
to the presbyters, and the ministration under them both to the deacons; that the divine
worship might be performed in purity. For it is not lawful for a deacon to offer the sacrifice,
or to baptize, or to give either the greater or the lesser blessing. Nor may a presbyter perform
ordination; for it is not agreeable to holiness to have this order perverted. For “God is not
the God of confusion,”1638 that the subordinate persons should tyrannically assume to
themselves the functions belonging to their superiors, forming a new scheme of laws to their
own mischief, not knowing that “it is hard for them to kick against the pricks;”1639 for such
as these do not fight against us, or against the bishops, but against the universal Bishop and
the High Priest of the Father, Jesus Christ our Lord.1640 High priests, priests, and Levites

were ordained by Moses,1641 the most beloved of God. By our Saviour1642 were we apostles,
thirteen in number, ordained; and by the apostles I James, and I Clement, and others with
us, were ordained, that we may not make the catalogue of all those bishops over again. And
in common, presbyters, and deacons, and sub-deacons, and readers, were ordained by all
of us. The great High Priest therefore, who is so by nature, is Christ the only begotten; not
having snatched that honour to Himself, but having been appointed such by the Father;
who being made man for our sake, and offering the spiritual sacrifice to His God and Father,
before His suffering gave it us alone in charge to do this, although there were others with
us who had believed in Him. But he that believes is not presently appointed a priest, or obtains
the dignity of the high-priesthood. But after His ascension we offered, according to His
constitution, the pure and unbloody sacrifice; and ordained bishops, and presbyters, and
deacons, seven in number: one of which was Stephen,1643 that blessed martyr, who was not
inferior to us as to his pious disposition of mind towards God; who showed so great piety
towards God, by his faith and love towards our Lord Jesus Christ, as to give his life for Him,
and was stoned to death by the Jews, the murderers of the Lord. Yet still this so great and
good a man, who was fervent in spirit, who saw Christ on the right hand of God, and the
gates of heaven opened, does nowhere appear to have exercised functions which did not
appertain to his office of a deacon, nor to have offered the sacrifices, nor to have laid hands
upon any, but kept his order of a deacon unto the end. For so it became him, who was a
martyr for Christ, to preserve good order. But if some do blame Philip1644 our deacon, and
Ananias1645 our faithful brother, that the one did baptize the eunuch, and the other me
Paul, these men do not understand what we say. For we have affirmed only that no one
snatches the sacerdotal dignity to himself, but either receives it from God, as Melchisedec
and Job, or from the high priest, as Aaron from Moses. Wherefore Philip and Ananias did
not constitute themselves, but were appointed by Christ, the High Priest of that God to
whom no being is to be compared.</p>

<p>XLVII.1. Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops.</p>
<p>2. A presbyter by one bishop, as also a deacon, and the rest of the clergy.1647</p>
<p>3. If any bishop or presbyter, otherwise than our Lord has ordained concerning the
sacrifice, offer other things at the altar of God, as honey, milk, or strong beer instead of wine,
any necessaries, or birds, or animals, or pulse, otherwise than is ordained, let him be deprived;
excepting grains of new corn, or ears of wheat, or bunches of grapes in their season.1648</p>
<p>4. For it is not lawful to offer anything besides these at the altar, and oil for the holy
lamp, and incense in the time of the divine oblation.</p>
<p>5. But let all other fruits be sent to the house of the bishop, as first-fruits to him and to
the presbyters, but not to the altar. Now it is plain that the bishop and presbyters are to divide
them to the deacons and to the rest of the clergy.</p>
<p>6. Let not a bishop, a priest, or a deacon1649 cast off his own wife under pretence of
piety; but if he does cast her off, let him be suspended. If he go on in it, let him be deprived.</p>
<p>7. Let not a bishop, a priest, or deacon undertake the cares of this world; but if he do,
let him be deprived.1650</p>
<p>8. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon shall celebrate the holiday of the passover before
the vernal equinox with the Jews, let him be deprived.1651</p>
<p>9. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or any one of the catalogue of the priesthood,
when the oblation is over, does not communicate, let him give his reason; and if it be just,
let him be forgiven; but if he does not do it, let him be suspended, as becoming the cause of
damage to the people, and occasioning a suspicion against him that offered, as of one that
did not rightly offer.1652</p>

<p>10. All those of the faithful that enter into the holy church of God, and hear the sacred
Scriptures, but do not stay during prayer and the holy communion, must be suspended, as
causing disorder in the church.</p>
<p>11. If any one, even in the house, prays with a person excommunicate, let him also be
suspended.</p>
<p>12. If any clergyman prays with one deprived as with a clergyman, let himself also be
deprived.</p>
<p>13. If any clergyman or layman who is suspended, or ought not to be received,1653 goes
away, and is received in another city without commendatory letters, let both those who received
him and he that was received be suspended. But if he be already suspended, let his
suspension be lengthened, as lying to and deceiving the Church of God.</p>
<p>14. A bishop ought not to leave his own parish and leap to another, although the multitude
should compel him, unless there be some good reason forcing him to do this, as that
he can contribute much greater profit to the people of the new parish by the word of piety;
but this is not to be settled by himself, but by the judgment of many bishops, and very great
supplication.</p>
<p>15. If any presbyter or deacon, or any one of the catalogue of the clergy, leaves his own
parish and goes to another, and, entirely removing himself, continues in that other parish
without the consent of his own bishop, him we command no longer to go on in his ministry,
especially in case his bishop calls upon him to return, and he does not obey, but continues
in his disorder. However, let him communicate there as a layman.</p>
<p>16. But if the bishop with whom they are undervalues the deprivation decreed against
them, and receives them as clergymen, let him be suspended as a teacher of disorder.</p>
<p>17. He who has been twice married after his baptism, or has had a concubine, cannot
be made a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue.1654</p>
<p>18. He who has taken a widow, or a divorced woman, or an harlot, or a servant, or one
belonging to the theatre, cannot be either a bishop, priest, or deacon, or indeed any one of
the sacerdotal catalogue.</p>
<p>19. He who has married two sisters, or his brother’s or sister’s daughter, cannot be a
clergyman.</p>
<p>20. Let a clergyman who becomes a surety be deprived.</p>
<p>21. Let an eunuch, if he be such by the injury of men, or his virilia were taken away in
the persecution, or he was born such, and yet is worthy of episcopacy, be made a bishop.</p>

<p>22. Let not him who has disabled himself be made a clergyman; for he is a self-murderer,
and an enemy to the creation of God.1655</p>
<p>23. If any one who is of the clergy disables himself, let him be deprived, for he is a
murderer of himself.</p>
<p>24. Let a layman who disables himself be separated for three years, for he lays a snare
for his own life.1656</p>
<p>25. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who is taken in fornication, or perjury, or
stealing, be deprived, but not suspended; for the Scripture says: “Thou shall not avenge twice
for the same crime by affliction.”1657</p>
<p>26. In like manner also as to the rest of the clergy.</p>
<p>27. Of those who come into the clergy unmarried, we permit only the readers and
singers, if they have a mind, to marry afterward.1658</p>
<p>28. We command that a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who strikes the faithful that
offend, or the unbelievers who do wickedly, and thinks to terrify them by such means, be
deprived, for our Lord has nowhere taught us such things. On the contrary, “when Himself
was stricken, He did not strike again; when He was reviled, He reviled not again; when He
suffered, He threatened not.”1659</p>
<p>29. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who is deprived justly for manifest crimes,
does venture to meddle with that ministration which was once entrusted to him, let the
same person be entirely cut off from the Church.</p>
<p>30. If any bishop obtains that dignity by money, or even a presbyter or deacon, let him
and the person that ordained him be deprived; and let him be entirely cut off from communion,
as Simon Magus was by me Peter.1660</p>

<p>31. If any bishop makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their means obtains to
be a bishop of a church, let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with
him.</p>
<p>32. If any presbyter despises his own bishop, and assembles separately, and fixes another
altar, when he has nothing to condemn in his bishop either as to piety or righteousness, let
him be deprived as an ambitious person; for he is a tyrant, and the rest of the clergy, whoever
join themselves to him. And let the laity be suspended. But let these things be done after
one, and a second, or even a third admonition from the bishop.1661</p>
<p>33. If any presbyter or deacon be put under suspension by his bishop, it is not lawful
for any other to receive him, but for him only who put him under suspension, unless it
happens that he who put him under suspension die.</p>
<p>34. Do not ye receive any stranger, whether bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, without
commendatory letters; and when such are offered, let them be examined. And if they be
preachers of piety, let them be received; but if not, supply their wants, but do not receive
them to communion: for many things are done by surprise.</p>
<p>35. The bishops of every country ought to know who is the chief among them, and to
esteem him as their head, and not to do any great thing without his consent; but every one
to manage only the affairs that belong to his own parish, and the places subject to it. But let
him not do anything without the consent of all; for it is by this means there will be unanimity,
and God will be glorified by Christ, in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>36. A bishop must not venture to ordain out of his own bounds for cities or countries
that are not subject to him. But if he be convicted of having done so without the consent of
such as governed those cities or countries, let him be deprived, both the bishop himself and
those whom he has ordained.</p>
<p>37. If any bishop that is ordained does not undertake his office, nor take care of the
people committed to him, let him be suspended until he do undertake it; and in the like
manner a presbyter and a deacon. But if he goes, and is not received, not because of the
want of his own consent, but because of the ill temper of the people, let him continue bishop;
but let the clergy of that city be suspended, because they have not taught that disobedient
people better.</p>
<p>38. Let a synod of bishops be held twice in the year, and let them ask one another the
doctrines of piety; and let them determine the ecclesiastical disputes that happen—once in
the fourth week of Pentecost, and again on the twelfth of the month Hyperberetæus.</p>
<p>39. Let the bishop have the care of ecclesiastical revenues, and administer them as in
the presence of God. But it is not lawful for him to appropriate any part of them to himself,
<note type="footnote">1661 [Canons 32–41 also agree with those of Antioch; see note on Canon 9. Some of the regulations have,
however, an earlier date: whether they existed in this form before that time, is open to discussion.—R .]</note>

<pb n="1101"/>
or to give the things of God to his own kindred. But if they be poor, let him support them
as poor; but let him not, under such pretences, alienate the revenues of the Church.</p>
<p>40. Let not the presbyters and deacons do anything without the consent of the bishop,
for it is he who is entrusted with the people of the Lord, and will be required to give an account
of their souls. Let the proper goods of the bishop, if he has any, and those belonging
to the Lord, be openly distinguished, that he may have power when he dies to leave his own
goods as he pleases, and to whom he pleases; that, under pretence of the ecclesiastical revenues,
the bishop’s own may not come short, who sometimes has a wife and children, or
kinsfolk, or servants. For this is just before God and men, that neither the Church suffer
any loss by the not knowing which revenues are the bishop’s own, nor his kindred, under
pretence of the Church, be undone, or his relations fall into lawsuits, and so his death be liable
to reproach.1662</p>
<p>41. We command that the bishop have power over the goods of the Church; for if he
be entrusted with the precious souls of men, much more ought he to give directions about
goods, that they all be distributed to those in want, according to his authority, by the presbyters
and deacons, and be used for their support with the fear of God, and with all reverence.
He is also to partake of those things he wants, if he does want them, for his necessary occasions,
and those of the brethren who live with him, that they may not by any means be in
straits: for the law of God appointed that those who waited at the altar should be maintained
by the altar; since not so much as a soldier does at any time bear arms against the enemies
at his own charges.</p>
<p>42. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who indulges himself in dice or drinking, either
leave off those practices, or let him be deprived.1663</p>
<p>43. If a sub-deacon, a reader, or a singer does the like, either let him leave off, or let him
be suspended; and so for one of the laity.</p>

leave off to do so, or let him be deprived.</p>

<p>46. We command that a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who receives the baptism, or
the sacrifice of heretics, be deprived: “For what agreement is there between Christ and
Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel?”1665</p>
<p>47. If a bishop or presbyter rebaptizes him who has had true baptism, or does not baptize
him who is polluted by the ungodly, let him be deprived, as ridiculing the cross and the
death of the Lord, and not distinguishing between real priests and counterfeit ones.</p>
<p>48. If a layman divorces his own wife, and takes another, or one divorced by another,
let him be suspended.1666</p>
<p>49. If any bishop or presbyter does not baptize according to the Lord’s constitution,
into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but into three beings without beginning, or
into three Sons, or three Comforters, let him be deprived.1667</p>
<p>50. If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the three immersions of the one admission,
but one immersion, which is given into the death of Christ, let him be deprived; for
the Lord did not say, “Baptize into my death,” but, “Go ye and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Do ye,
therefore, O bishops, baptize thrice into one Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, according

<note type="footnote">1668 [This canon, the last of those in the collection of Dionysius, is regarded as among the most recent. Of
unknown origin.—R.] At the end of this canon, in the collection of John of Antioch, the following words are
added: “Let him that is baptized be taught that the Father was not crucified, nor endured to be born of man, nor
indeed that the Holy Spirit became man, or even endured suffering, for He was not made flesh; but the only
begotten Son ransomed the world from the wrath which lay upon it: for He became man through His love of
man, having fashioned a body for Himself from a virgin. For Wisdom built a house for herself as a Creator; but
He willingly endured the cross, and rescued the world from the wrath that lies on it, namely, those who are
baptized into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But let those who do not thus baptize be
suspended, as being ignorant of the mystery of piety.” The same collection gives the following as Canon 51: “He
who says that the Father suffered is more impious than the Jews, nailing along with Christ the Father also. He
who denies that the only begotten Son was made flesh for us, and endured the cross, fights with God, and is an
enemy of the saints. He that names the Holy Spirit Father or Son, is ignorant and foolish; for the Son is Creator</note>

<p>51. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue,
abstains from marriage, flesh, and wine, not for his own exercise, but because he abominates
these things, forgetting that “all things were very good,”1669 and that “God made man male
and female,”1670 and blasphemously abuses the creation, either let him reform, or let him
be deprived, and be cast out of the Church; and the same for one of the laity.1671</p>
<p>52. If any bishop or presbyter does not receive him that returns from his sin, but rejects
him, let him be deprived; because he grieves Christ, who says, “There is joy in heaven over
one sinner that repenteth.”1672</p>
<p>53. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon does not on festival days partake of flesh or
wine, let him be deprived, as “having a seared conscience,”1673 and becoming a cause of

when he is forced to bait at an inn upon the road.1674</p>

these, can be neither Christians nor clergymen.1686</p>

<p>74. If a bishop be accused of any crime by credible and faithful persons, it is necessary
that he be cited by the bishops; and if he comes and makes his apology, and yet is convicted,
let his punishment be determined. But if, when he is cited, he does not obey, let him be cited
a second time, by two bishops sent to him. But if even then he despises them, and will not
come, let the synod pass what sentence they please against him, that he may not appear to
gain advantage by avoiding their judgment.1691</p>

<p>75. Do not ye receive an heretic in a testimony against a bishop; nor a Christian if he
be single. For the law says, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.”</p>
<p>76. A bishop must not gratify his brother, or his son, or any other kinsman, with the
episcopal dignity, or ordain whom he pleases; for it is not just to make heirs to episcopacy,
and to gratify human affections in divine matters. For we must not put the Church of God
under the laws of inheritance; but if any one shall do so, let his ordination be invalid, and
let him be punished with suspension.1693</p>
<p>77. If any one be maimed in an eye, or lame of his leg, but is worthy of the episcopal
dignity, let him be made a bishop; for it is not a blemish of the body that can defile him, but
the pollution of the soul.1694</p>
<p>78. But if he be deaf and blind, let him not be made a bishop; not as being a defiled
person, but that the ecclesiastical affairs may not be hindered.</p>
<p>79. If any one hath a demon, let him not be made one of the clergy. Nay, let him not
pray with the faithful; but when he is cleansed, let him be received; and if he be worthy, let
him be ordained.1695</p>
<p>80. It is not right to ordain him bishop presently who is just come in from the Gentiles,
and baptized; or from a wicked mode of life: for it is unjust that he who has not yet afforded
any trial of himself should be a teacher of others, unless it anywhere happens by divine
grace.1696</p>
<p>81. We have said that a bishop ought not to let himself into public administrations, but
to attend on all opportunities upon the necessary affairs of the Church.1697 Either therefore
let him agree not to do so, or let him be deprived. For, “no one can serve two masters,”1698
according to the Lord’s admonition.1699</p>

<p>82. We do not permit servants to be ordained into the clergy without their masters’
consent; for this would grieve those that owned them. For such a practice would occasion
the subversion of families. But if at any time a servant appears worthy to be ordained into
an high office, such as our Onesimus appeared to be, and if his master allows of it, and gives
him his freedom, and dismisses him from his house, let him be ordained.1700</p>
<p>83. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, who goes to the army, and desires to retain
both the Roman government and the sacerdotal administration, be deprived. For “the things
of Cæsar belong to Cæsar, and the things of God to God.”1701</p>
<p>84. Whosoever shall abuse the king1702 or the governor unjustly, let him suffer punishment;
and if he be a clergyman, let him be deprived; but if he be a layman, let him be suspended.</p>
<p>85. Let the following books be esteemed venerable and holy by you, both of the clergy
and laity. Of the Old Covenant: the five books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy; one of Joshua the son of Nun, one of the Judges, one of Ruth,
four of the Kings, two of the Chronicles, two of Ezra, one of Esther, one of Judith, three of
the Maccabees, one of Job, one hundred and fifty psalms; three books of Solomon—Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; sixteen prophets. And besides these, take care that your
young persons learn the Wisdom of the very learned Sirach. But our sacred books, that is,
those of the New Covenant, are these: the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;
the fourteen Epistles of Paul; two Epistles of Peter, three of John, one of James, one of Jude;
two Epistles of Clement; and the Constitutions dedicated to you the bishops by me Clement,
in eight books; which it is not fit to publish before all, because of the mysteries contained
in them; and the Acts of us the Apostles.1703</p>
<p>Let these canonical rules be established by us for you, O ye bishops; and if you continue
to observe them, ye shall be saved, and shall have peace; but if you be disobedient, you shall
be punished, and have everlasting war one with another, and undergo a penalty suitable to

AND COL. III. 16; AND THE KISS, 1 COR. XVI. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">1705 1 Cor. xi. 23. To me there is great significance in the fact that the Apostle received this as an original
Gospel from the Lord Himself. Truly (2 Cor. xi. 5) he was not “a whit behind,” even that chief Apostle who reclined
in the bosom of the Great High Priest and adorable Lamb of God as He instituted the feast.</note>
<note type="footnote">1706 Matt. vi. 9. For this we have the important testimony of Gregory the Great, as preserved to his day: that
the Apostles (SS. Peter and Paul must have been primarily in his mind, of course) delivered no other “custom”
to the churches (i.e., as essential) than the words of Institution and the Lord’s Prayer. He says:—“Orationem
Dominicam, mox post precem, dicimus, quia mos Apostolorum erat, ad ipsam solummodo orationem oblationis
hostiam consecrare.”—Epist. ad Joann. Episc. Syrac., lib. ix. Ep. xii., Opp., tom. id. p. 958, ed. Migne. Now, for
the sense of post precem in the above, we have Justin Martyr for a primitive witness of Roman usage. He speaks
of the words of Institution expressly (vol. i. cap. lxvi. p. 185) as “the Prayer of the Logos” (δι΄ ἐυχῆς Λόγου), in
the use of which he makes the essential act of the Oblation to consist. Liturgic fulness may or may not require
more, but the essentials are thus simple. So far, the Roman Missal to this day sustains the words of Gregory. It
is overloaded with ceremonial, but does not include the noble features on which the Greeks lay so great stress:
i.e., the conjoint Oblation and Invocation. See 1 Pet. ii. 5.</note>

<pb n="1110"/>
<p>7. Communion.</p>
<p>Let us note also that the Apostle had “delivered” unto the Corinthians (1 Cor. xi. 23),
as doubtless to others (1 Cor. vii. 17), certain institutions which he ordained in all the
churches, and for departing from which he censures the Corinthians in this place (ver. 17
compared with ver. 2) in certain particulars. In chap. xiv. at ver. 40, he refers to these ordinances
as a τάξις, in the performance of which they were to proceed (κοσμίως) with due order,
becomingly; not with mere decency, but with a beautiful decorum of service.</p>
<p>Finally, let me suggest that there are fragments of the Apostle’s (παράδοσεις) instructions
everywhere scattered through his Epistles, such as the minute canon1707 concerning the
veiling of women in acts of worship, insisting upon it with a length of argument which in
one of the Apostolic Fathers would be considered childish. He also insisted that his τάξις
is from the Lord.</p>
<p>Fragments of the primitive hymns are also scattered through the Apostles’ writings, as,
e.g.,—
<lg>
<l>́Εγειραι ὁ καθεύδων,</l>
<l>καὶ ἀνάστα ἐκ τω̑ν νεκρω̑ν</l>
<l>καὶ ἐπιφαύσει σοι ὀ Χριστός.1708</l>
</lg>
Of such passages the formula (διὸ λέγει) “It saith” seems to be a frequent index.</p>
<p>May we not conclude also that the sublime prayer and doxology of Eph. iii. 14–21 is a
quotation from the Apostle’s own eucharistic τάξις for the whole state of Christ’s Church
militant?</p>
<p>Might not the same be more constantly used in our days as an intercession for the whole
flock of the one Shepherd?</p>

<p>II.
(Fulfil His constitution, p. 489.)</p>
<p>The Pauline Norm being borne in mind, we shall best comprehend this Clementine
liturgy, as to its primitive claims, by taking the testimony of Justin, writing in Rome to the
Antonines a. d.160. Referring to the Apology in our first volume, we observe that the order
kept up in his day was this:—</p>
<p>1. Prayers for all estates of men.</p>
<p>2. The kiss of peace.</p>
<p>3. Oblation of bread and wine.</p>
<note type="footnote">1707 1 Cor. xi. 5, 6. Here men are equally enjoined not to follow the Jewish rite of covering their heads in
prayer.</note>
<note type="footnote">1708 Eph. v. 14.</note>

<pb n="1111"/>
<p>4. Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>5. Words of institution.</p>
<p>6. The prayer ending with Amen.</p>
<p>7. Communion.</p>
<p>Now, a century later, we may suppose the original of this Clementine to have taken a
fuller shape; of which still later this Clementine is the product.1709</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the early Roman use was (Greek) borrowed wholly from the East;1710
and, comparing the testimony of Justin with the Pauline Norm, may we not suppose that
this norm in Rome was augmented by the Eastern uses, and so preserves a true name in that
of the first Bishop of Rome, who accepted it from Jerusalem or Antioch?</p>

<p>III.
(That He may show this bread, etc., p. 489.)</p>
<p>From a recent essay by Dr. Williams, the erudite bishop of Connecticut, I am permitted
to cite, as follows:—</p>
<p>Compare the original texts thus:—</p>
<p>Clementine.1711 Irenæus.1712</p>
<p>ὅπως ἀποφηνῃ τὴν θυσίαν ταύτην, καὶ
τὸν ἄ́ρτον σω̑μα του̑ Χριστου̑, καὶ τὸ
ὀπως αποφηνῃ τοὸν ὰρτον του̑τον σω̑μα
του̑ Χριστου̑ σου καὶ τὸ ποτήριον του̑τον
αἰμα του̑ Χριστου̑ σου ινα οἱ μεταλαβόντες,
κ.τ.λ.</p>
<p>ποτήριον τὸ αἰμα του̑ Χριστου̑ ἴνα οἱ
μεταλαβόντες, κ.τ.λ.</p>
<p>Bishop Williams then proceeds to inquire:—
“How is this striking agreement to be explained? Does Irenæus quote from the Clementine,
or the Clementine from him? Or is it not much more likely that they are independent
witnesses to primitive uses, going back to the period of the persecutions, and extending far
beyond the limits of Syria or Palestine’?”1713</p>

has long been a scandal to patristic inquiry,—are surely such tokens. They enrich the reader
with definite ideas on many collateral subjects. May they not stimulate American scholarship
and American affluence to fresh enterprises of the same character for the advancement of
learning, and the glory of the world’s Redeemer and Illuminator?
The very early date to which this homily is now assigned makes its slightest allusions
to the New-Testament canon of very great importance. I have ventured to indicate a few
such, even where they may be mere allusions, not textual quotations: as, e.g., on p. 517, at
notes 20 and 22, slight indications of a reference to the Second Epistle of St. Peter and to
the Apocalypse.1</p>
<p>I shall have occasion to refer to this work in the elucidation of the Liturgies which are
to follow. If it be, as Bishop Lightfoot supposes, a homily of the second century, it may lend
important retrospective aid to the student of these volumes in other particulars; but, having
entrusted this interesting relic to the editorial care of a most competent scholar, I shall not
presume to anticipate his judgment in any matter.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 If this reference to 2 Pet. iii. 9 be probable, it is one of the earliest testimonies to the genuine character of
that Epistle. The true Clement has two references to the same (pp. 8 and 11, vol. i., this series), and Justin also
(vol. i. p. 240) is credited with a similar reference to 2 Peter and the Apocalypse. See Lardner, Credib., vol. ii. p.

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE BY PROFESSOR M. B. RIDDLE, D.D.</head>

<p>SECTION 1.—TEXT.</p>
<p>In this volume, pp. 372–376, will be found a brief account of the Codex discovered by
Bryennios, now Metropolitan of Nicomedia. It remains in the library of the Jerusalem
Monastery of the Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople. While the publication of the Greek
text of the Teaching awakened unusual interest, the recovery of that document has not been
the only valuable result of this important discovery. The Codex, as was speedily known,
contains the only complete copy of the Greek text of the two Epistles of Clement. The lacunæ
previously existing in the genuine Epistle were not extensive; but, as now appears, the Alexandrian
manuscript contains only three-fifths of the second Epistle. The entire Greek text
of both Epistles was given to the public by Bryennios2 in 1875.</p>
<p>This at once led to a revision of some recent editions, notably those of Hilgenfeld,3 and
of Gebhardt and Harnack.4 Many monographs soon appeared. But the discovery of a new
(Syriac) source for the text in 1876, while not affecting the general problem, gave to
patristic scholars more abundant critical material. Bishop Lightfoot’s Appendix5 contains
the most convenient and accessible collation of this material, as well as the most clear
statements on all points affected by the two discoveries. The Syriac manuscript, containing
a version of the two Epistles of Clement, was purchased by the Cambridge University Library
in 1876, from the collection of “the late Oriental scholar M. Jules Mohl of Paris” (Lightfoot).
It embraces the entire New Testament, except the Apocalypse, in the Harkleian recension
of the Philoxenian (or later) Syriac version; but the scribe has inserted the two Epistles of
Clement (entire) between the Catholic and Pauline Epistles. The value of the manuscript
for New-Testament criticism is great, and the phenomena it presents interesting, as bearing
on the discussion of the New-Testament canon; but the paucity of sources for the text of
the Clementine Epistles gives special importance to the discovery of a version of these
writings so soon after the recovery of the entire Greek text. A discussion of the textual

Introductory Notice by Professor M. B. Riddle, D.D.
questions is forbidden by the limits of this Introductory Notice, but a few points may be
stated:—</p>
<p>1. A comparison of the three authorities (the Alexandrian, the Constantinopolitan, and
the Syriac), in the parts they in common contain, shows that the first is most trustworthy,
and that the Syriac is usually more correct than the Constantinopolitan.</p>
<p>2. Hence, in the recovered portions, the authority of the Syriac is very valuable in correcting
the obvious blunders of the Greek copy. This should teach caution in accepting the
text of the Teaching, where the same Greek manuscript is our only authority.</p>
<p>3. The genuine Epistle of Clement, which stands next in age to the canonical books of
the New Testament, now stands next in accuracy of text also. Doubt in regard to textual
questions decreases as the critical material increases.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.—PLACE AND DATE OF COMPOSITION; AUTHOR.</p>
<p>The recovery of the entire text of the Second Epistle settles the question as to the purpose
of the work. As was previously surmised, it is a homily (comp. chaps. xvii., xix., xx.);
moreover, it was “read” by the author at public worship after the Scripture lesson (see Chap.
xix). But as to place, date, and author, there is still diversity of opinion. The three questions
are closely related. The view of Bishop Lightfoot seems, on the whole, most tenable. He regards
the homily as of Corinthian origin, delivered, in all probability, between a. d. 120 and
140, but the work of an unknown author, who seems to have been one of the presbyters of
the church,—possibly the bishop. The allusions to the athletic games are in favour of Corinth.
On this theory the title is thus accounted for: The genuine Epistle of Clement was addressed
to the Corinthians, and read in the church of that city from time to time. This homily was
probably read in the same manner, and at length united in a manuscript copy with the
other. Each was “to the Corinthians:” hence it was gradually inferred that both were Epistles
of Clement. Of this succession or movement Lightfoot finds some indications in the manuscript
authorities.</p>
<p>The internal evidence of an early date has been increased by the discovery of the concluding
portion, but there is nothing to determine the exact time of composition. The distinction
made in Chap. xiv. between the Old and New Testaments, as well as the use of the
Gospel of the Egyptians (at the close of chap. xii.), taken in connection with the unmistakeable
citations of New-Testament passages as of Divine authority, point to the first half of the
second century as the probable period. The absence of all direct opposition to Gnosticism
points to an origin within the same limits. All these considerations make against the view
of Hilgenfeld, who attributes the homily to Clement of Alexandria, thus assigning it to the
latter half of the second century.</p>
<p>In regard to the author, nothing further is learned from the newly recovered portion,
except the fact that he was a preacher. Even this does not determine his ecclesiastical position,
since at that early date much freedom of utterance was permitted in Christian assemblies.</p>

<pb n="1117"/>
<p>It is, however, very probable that the author was a presbyter; and it is not improbable that
he was the chief presbyter, or local bishop.</p>
<p>The homily is still attributed to a person named Clement, but there are three theories
as to what Clement. (1) Bryennios stands almost alone in claiming that the document is the
work of Clemens Romanus. The internal evidence against this view was quite sufficient before
the full text of the two Epistles was known; now it is to be regarded as abundantly conclusive.
Even the English version of the two writings will suggest to the intelligent reader the points
of difference. (2) As intimated above, Hilgenfeld regards Clement of Alexandria as the author;
but this places the homily too late. Moreover, the writings of the Alexandrian Father stand
immensely above this feeble, commonplace, and chaotic production. Even the citation from
the Gospel of the Egyptians, common to both,6 is differently used by the two authors;
Clement of Alexandria opposing the interpretation favoured in this homily, as well as objecting
to the authority of that apocryphal Gospel. Hilgenfeld’s argument from the word
φιλοσοφει̑ν in chap. xix., is invalidated by the improbability of that reading; see note in
loco. (3) The most plausible view, as Bishop Lightfoot admits, is that of Harnack. He assigns
the homily to a third Clement, referred to, as he supposes, in the Shepherd of Hermas,7 and
living somewhat later than Clement of Rome. In favour of this may be urged: some similarity
to the Shepherd of Hermas, the probability that at the date of the later writing Clement of
Rome was not living, and the easy explanation it affords of the traditional title. But, while
a third Clement may have lived at Rome, we have no evidence other than the doubtful hint
in the Shepherd. The allusion in that work seems far more appropriate to the well-known
Clement of Rome. The argument from the later date of the Shepherd proves very little; not
only is the date uncertain, but the visions are placed quite early. The editor of this series,
while accepting a. d. 160 as the probable date of the Shepherd, regards it as a compilation,
introducing “Hermas and Clement to identify the times which are idealized in his allegory.”8
The view of Bishop Lightfoot, therefore, seems to be the safest.</p>

<p>SECTION 3.—CHARACTER AND CONTENTS.</p>
<p>The style of the homily is poor. It abounds in connectives, which link unconnected
ideas; its thought is feeble, its theology peculiar though not false, its arrangement confused.
While it furnishes some historical data for practical theology, it is, in homiletical method
and matter, in sharp contrast with the Apostolic writings and with the homilies of Origen.
Though referring to Scripture, it has none of the virtues of the expository discourse; though
hortatory in tone, it has little of the unity and directness of better sermons of that class. Its
chief excellence is its brevity.</p>
<note type="footnote">6 See chap. xii., and Clem. Alex., Stromata, iii. 13, vol. ii. p. 398.</note>
<note type="footnote">7 See Vision II. 4, vol. ii. p. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">8 See vol. ii. p. 4; and comp. Lightfoot, Appendix, pp. 316, 317.</note>

<pb n="1118"/>
<p>It is difficult to make an analysis of the contents. The theme is the duty of fulfilling the
commands of Christ.</p>
<p>(1) This obedience is the true confession of Christ, answering to the greatness of His
salvation; mainly in chaps. i.-iv.</p>
<p>(2) Thus the Christian shows his opposition to the world; chaps. v.-viii.</p>
<p>(3) This obedience will be rewarded in the future world; chaps. ix.-xvii.</p>
<p>(4) The conclusion: the preacher’s confession (xviii.), justification of his exhortation
(xix.); concluding word of consolation, with doxology (xx.). But the treatment is not strictly
logical, nor are the parts clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>The theology shows no traces of heresy, nor does it sharply oppose any false doctrinal
views. It lacks the dogmatic precision of a later age, but emphasizes rigid views of the relation
of the sexes. “Repentance and good works seem to be the main articles of its creed. Of regeneration
there seems to be no definite idea: to be called is the same as to be saved. The Church
is pre-existent; the kingdom of God is in the future; no worth is left to this world or to the
life in it. The principal argument urged in favour of standing firm in faith is the good issue
of it in the next life” (C. J. H. Ropes).</p>
<p>The hints given in regard to public worship agree with the famous description of Justin
Martyr,9 and there are indications that the early freedom of exhortation had not yet disappeared.
Bishop Lightfoot aptly concludes his dissertation with these words: “the homily itself,
as a literary work, is almost worthless. As the earliest example of its kind, however, and as
the product of an important age of which we possess only the scantiest remains, it has the
highest value. Nor will its intellectual poverty blind us to its true grandeur, as an example
of the lofty moral earnestness and the triumphant faith which subdued a reluctant world,
and laid it prostrate at the foot of the cross.” 10</p>

<p>SECTION 4.—THE VERSION IN THIS VOLUME.</p>
<p>Greater unity would have been secured by a new translation of the entire work. Since,
however, this was not possible, the aim of the editor has been to give the reader, as far as
practicable, the benefit of the light shed upon the whole by the recently discovered authorities.
The portion already translated in the Edinburgh volume has been supplied with critical
annotations, and a few exegetical points have been treated. The recent editions of the Greek
text have, of course, been consulted. The newly recovered portion has been re-translated.
Bishop Lightfoot’s version is so excellent that the temptation to use it was very great. It has,
of course, influenced the editor in many places. But the following version differs from it
mainly in two respects: (1) An effort has been made to preserve the verbal correspondences
between the language of the homily and that of the New Testament: hence the English word
<note type="footnote">9 First Apology, ch. lxvii. (vol. i. p. 186).</note>
<note type="footnote">10 St. Clement, Appendix, p. 317.</note>

<pb n="1119"/>
used in the Revised Version as an equivalent of a Greek term is given here as a similar
equivalent. (2) The view of the Greek tenses indicated in Lightfoot’s renderings does not
always accord with that of the editor.</p>
<p>It may be added, that Professor C. J. H. Ropes of Bangor, Me., kindly sent, for use in
the preparation of the Epistle for this volume, his manuscript translation and notes. These
have been very helpful, and are entitled to this acknowledgment. It will be found that the
American translation is less paraphrastic than the Edinburgh. The new portions, both text
and notes, have been printed without brackets when they are the work of the editor. The
rare additions of the general editor are always bracketed, that the reader may readily recognise
to whom the literary responsibility in each case properly belongs.</p>
<p>The following is the Edinburgh Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The first certain reference which is made by any early writer to this so-called Epistle of
Clement is found in these words of Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 38): “We must know that there
is also a second Epistle of Clement. But we do not regard it as being equally notable with
the former, since we know of none of the ancients that have made use of it.” Several critics
in modern times have endeavoured to vindicate the authenticity of this Epistle. But it is now
generally regarded as one of the many writings which have been falsely ascribed to Clement.
Besides the want of external evidence, indicated even by Eusebius in the above extract, the
diversity of style clearly points to a different writer from that of the first Epistle. A commonly
accepted opinion among critics at the present day is, that this is not an Epistle at all, but a
fragment of one of the many homilies falsely ascribed to Clement. There can be no doubt,
however, that in the catalogue of writings contained in the Alexandrian ms. it is both styled
an Epistle, and, as well as the other which accompanies it, is attributed to Clement. As the
ms. is certainly not later than the fifth century, the opinion referred to must by that time
have taken firm root in the Church; but in the face of internal evidence, and in want of all
earlier testimony, such a fact goes but a small way to establish its authenticity.</p>

<p>Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of God,—as the Judge of
the living and the dead. And it does not become us12 to think lightly13 of our salvation; for
if we think little14 of Him, we shall also hope but to obtain little from Him. And those of
us15 who hear carelessly of these things, as if they were of small importance, commit sin,
not knowing whence we have been called, and by whom, and to what place, and how much
Jesus Christ submitted to suffer for our sakes. What return, then, shall we make to Him? or
what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to us? For,16 indeed, how great
are the benefits17 which we owe to Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He
has called us sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish. What praise, then, shall
we give to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which we have received?18 We
were deficient19 in understanding, worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver, and
brass, the works of men’s hand;20 and our whole life was nothing else than death. Involved

<p>“Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for
she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband.”26 In that He
said, “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not,” He referred to us, for our Church was barren
before that children were given to her. But when He said, “Cry out, thou that travailest not,”
He means this, that we should sincerely offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like
women in travail, show signs of weakness.27 And in that He said, “For she that is desolate
hath many more children than she that hath an husband,” He means that28 our people
seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous
than those who are reckoned to possess God.29 And another Scripture saith, “I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners.”30 This means that those who are perishing must be saved.
For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to establish, not the things which are standing,
but these that are falling. Thus also did Christ desire31 to save the things which were perish-

show that we do indeed know Him,35 but by not denying Him through whom this knowledge
has been attained? For He Himself declares,36 “Whosoever shall confess Me before men,
him will I confess before My Father.”37 This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by
whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing what He says,
and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not with our lips only,

<p>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, “Not every

Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by42 our works, by loving one another, by not

compassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious.

<p>Wherefore, brethren, leaving willingly our sojourn in this present world, let us do the
will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart out of this world. For the Lord saith, “Ye
shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves.”47 And Peter answered and said unto Him,48 “What,
then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?” Jesus said unto Peter, “The lambs have
no cause after they are dead to fear49 the wolves; and in like manner, fear not ye them that
kill you, and can do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has power
over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire.”50 And consider,51 brethren, that the
sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is
great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life everlasting.52 By what
course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous
life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires
upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the path of righteousness.53</p>

whole heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord,
while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world,
no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren,
by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments
of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. For the Lord saith in the Gospel, “If ye have not kept
that which was small, who will commit to you the great? For I say unto you, that he that is

are84 influenced by human terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment to the promise
which shall afterwards be fulfilled. For they know not what torment present enjoyment incurs,
or what felicity is involved in the future promise. And if, indeed, they themselves only did

<p>Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall be righteous; but if we do not
serve Him, because we believe not the promise of God, we shall be miserable. For the
prophetic word also declares, “Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their
heart, who say, All these things have we heard even in the times of our fathers; but though
we have waited day by day, we have seen none of them accomplished. Ye fools! compare
yourselves to a tree; take, for instance, the vine. First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud
appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit. So, likewise, my people
have borne disturbances and afflictions, but afterwards shall they receive their good things.”86
Wherefore, my brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure, that
we also may obtain the reward. For He is faithful who has promised that He will bestow on
every one a reward according to his works. If, therefore, we shall do righteousness in the
sight of God, we shall enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, “which ear

one when His kingdom would come, replied, “When two shall be one, and that which is
without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female.”88
Now, two are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly one
soul in two bodies. And “that which is without as that which is within” meaneth this: He
calls the soul “that which is within,” and the body “that which is without.” As, then, thy

repent with the whole heart, thus giving to yourselves salvation and life. For by doing this
we shall set a goal168 for all the young who are minded to labour169 on behalf of piety and
the goodness of God. And let us not, unwise ones that we are, be affronted and sore displeased,
whenever some one admonisheth and turneth us from iniquity unto righteousness.
For sometimes while we are practising evil things we do not perceive it on account of the
double-mindedness and unbelief that is in our breasts, and we are “darkened in our understanding”
170 by our vain lusts. Let us then practice righteousness that we may be saved unto
the end. Blessed are they that obey these ordinances. Even if for a little time they suffer evil
in the world,171 they shall enjoy the immortal fruit of the resurrection. Let not then the
godly man be grieved, if he be wretched in the times that now are; a blessed time waits for
him. He, living again above with the fathers, shall be joyful for an eternity without grief.</p>

Lightfoot says, “The aorist here has its common gnomic sense;” and he therefore interprets the passage as a
general statement: “Sordid motives bring their own punishment in a judicial blindness.” But this gnomic sense
of the aorist is not common. C reads δεσμός, which yields this sense: “and a chain weighed upon him.” Hilgenfeld
refers the passage to those Christians who suffered persecution for other causes than those of righteousness.
Harnack thinks the author has in mind Satan, as the prince of avarice, and regards him as already loaded with
chains. If the aorist is taken in its usual sense, this is the preferable explanation; but the meaning is obscure.</note>

<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE
TO
THE EARLY LITURGIES.</head>
<p>It is in curious contrast with the work of Brett and others like-minded that we have in
these Edinburgh translations a reflection from the minds of divines who are unused to
liturgies, and who have no interest in their elucidation. For the mere reader this is not an
advantage; but the student who goes to the originals will find that it affords at times no inconsiderable
help. These translations are “inartificially drawn,” as the lawyers say. They are
so much Greek and Latin rendered grammatically by competent scholars, who have no
theories to sustain, and who are equally devoid of technique and of a disposition to exhibit
it for the support of preconceptions. Not infrequently one gets a new view of certain stereotyped
expressions from the way in which they are here handled. The liturgiologist finds his
researches freshened by etymologies he had hardly thought of, here literally rendered. Of
course, these are mere specimens, and no one can use them for argument, except by comparison
with the Greek, or the Latin of Renaudot, or the originals in Syriac or Coptic; but
they will prove very useful in many ways. The whole science is in its infancy; and we have
no specimen of a primitive liturgy unless it be the Clementine, so called. The specimens
here given are like cloth of gold (Ps. xlv. 13), moth-eaten and patched, and spangled over
with tinsel; and the true artist has only the one object in view,—to restore it, that is, to the
king’s daughter, as it was aforetime.</p>
<p>The following is the announcement of the Messrs. Clark in the Edinburgh edition: “The
Liturgy of St. James has been translated by William Macdonald, M.A.; that of the Evangelist
Mark by George Ross Merry, B.A.; and that of the Holy Apostles by Dr. Donaldson.”</p>
<p>It will be observed that the translations are given in the Edinburgh series with hardly a
line of comment, and with no editorial helps to the reader whatever. These have been scantily
supplied, here and there, where the case seemed to require some elucidation; and in a few
instances I have ventured to reduce a word or two in the rendering to liturgical phraseology.</p>
<p>The interest which has recently been awakened in liturgiology, and which exists among
the learned so generally, will justify me in stating somewhat at large the considerations
which are prerequisites to an intelligent study of these compilations. I shall not depart from
my rule, nor formulate my personal convictions; but I must indicate sources of information
not mentioned by the Edinburgh editors, only remarking, that, while they have cited the
learned and excellent Dr. Neale, with others who advance untenable claims in some instances,

<pb n="1140"/>
I shall refer to writers of a more moderate school, such as have taken a less narrow and more
historic view of the whole matter. By claiming too much, and by reading their own ideas
back into the ancient exemplars, many good and learned men have overdone their argument,
and confused scriptural simplicity with the artificial systems of post-Nicene ages. Earnest
and worthy of respect as they are, I must therefore prefer a class of writers who breathe the
spirit of the ante-Nicene Fathers as better elucidating the primitive epoch and its principles,
alike in doctrine and worship.</p>
<p>Hippolytus, in a few terse sentences, has pointed out the epoch of David, in its vast import,
as the dawning of Christianity itself.12 More elaborately, a recent writer of great erudition
has expounded the same historic fact, and given us the pivot of Hebrew history on
which turns the whole system of that “goodly fellowship of prophets” who heralded the Sun
of righteousness as successive constellations rise before the day. The learned Dean
Payne-Smith, more minutely than Hippolytus, identifies Samuel, the master of David, as
the great instrument of God in shaping the institutions of Moses to be a prelude to the Advent;
in other words, transforming a local and tribal religion into that of Catholicity. The
value of the Dean’s condensed and luminous elaboration of this cardinal truth can hardly
be overstated.</p>
<p>But, to go behind even the Dean’s stand-point, we shall better comprehend the era of
which, under God, Samuel was the author, by noting the immense importance of that specific
Mosaic ordinance which not only made it possible, but which proves that an all-wise
prolepsis governed the whole law of Moses. We generally conceive of the Mosaic system as
one of unlimited hecatombs and burnt-offerings. On the contrary, it was a system restricting
and limiting the unsystematized primeval institution of sacrifice, which had done its work
by passing into the universal religions and rituals of Gentilism.3 When the seminal idea of
expiation, atonement, and the blood of innocence as a propitiation for guilt, was communicated
to all the families of the earth, the Mosaic institutions limited sacrifices for the
faithful, and localized them with marvellous significance. Previously the faithful everywhere
had imitated the sacrifices of their fathers, Noah and Abraham, who reared their altars
everywhere, as Job also did,—wherever they dwelt or sojourned. Now mark the first step
towards a more spiritual worship, based, nevertheless, on the fundamental principle of
sacrifice. Moses ordains as follows:—</p>
<note type="footnote">1</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Vol. v. note 2, p. 170.</note>
<note type="footnote">3 Vol. vi. p. 542, Elucidation VI.</note>

<pb n="1141"/>
<p>1. “When ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth
you,…then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His name
to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you, your burnt-offerings,” etc.4</p>
<p>2. “Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou
seest; but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of the tribes, there thou shalt offer
thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.”5</p>
<p>3. “If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put His name there, be too far
from thee” [i.e., for frequent sacrifices; observe, nevertheless, the law as to the sanctity of blood
in thy common use of meats, and forbear to sacrifice, till the opportunity comes], “only thy
holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the
Lord shall choose; and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the
altar of the Lord thy God.”6</p>
<p>4. “Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God, in the place
which He shall choose.”7</p>
<p>5. “Thou mayest not sacrifice The Passover within any of thy gates;…but at the place
which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover.”
Note, further, that all this provision and prevision was part of the great Messianic system,
which reached its crisis in the time of David, as prophetic of “the Son of David.”</p>
<p>It was the office of Samuel to take the Mosaic ordinances just there, and to shape them
for the advent of the Lamb of God, for His sacrifice upon Calvary, and for the setting-up of
His universal kingdom.</p>
<p>The Institutions of Samuel, therefore, were in essence institutions for the Gospel-day,
and they were completed by the anointing of David as king, and by his prophetic mission
to provide the Psalter (of which more, by and by); then the Ark came out of curtains, and
the Lord chose and appointed the place of which Moses had spoken,—none other than the
spot where Abraham had rehearsed in type the Sacrifice and Resurrection of Christ, according
as it was written:8 “Jehovah-Jireh…in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.” Thus, all sacrifice
acceptable to God was shown to have reference to the Paschal Lamb, who on that mount of
the Lord should be sacrificed, and rise again, as was accomplished in a figure aforetime.9</p>
<note type="footnote">4 Deut. xii. 6.</note>

<note type="footnote">8 Gen. xxii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">9 Heb. xi. 19.</note>

<pb n="1142"/>
<p>And next, the Psalmist commemorates the putting away of the migratory Tabernacle,
and the rest of the Ark of the Covenant in the place designed for the grand accomplishment
of redemption (“the sure mercies of David”), as follows:10—</p>
<p>“He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: but chose the
tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved. And He built His sanctuary like high palaces,
like the earth which He hath established for ever.”</p>
<p>Thus, localized sacrifice was made to designate the spot where the one propitiatory
sacrifice should be offered, “for the sins of the whole world;” and that spot in turn interpreted
the great canon of redemption,11—
<lg>
<l>“Without shedding of blood is no remission:”</l>
</lg>
and all this, being accomplished in the Messiah, passed away for ever. The veil of the Temple
was rent when Jesus cried, “It is finished.”</p>
<p>And now let us note the “Institutions of Samuel.” The localizing of the Temple-worship
made way for the clearer revelation of spiritual sacrifices: the Temple itself was to be supplied
with an expository liturgy. Moreover, a liturgical system, revolving about the central worship
of the Temple, was to be brought to every man’s door by the establishment of the synagogue
for the villages of Israel.12 The synagogue-worship became, therefore, the education and
preparation of the faithful for the simple and spiritual worship of the new law. This our
Lord Himself expounded in the grand Catholicity of His words to the outcast Samaritans:—
<lg>
<l>“The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,</l>
<l rend="indent">worship the Father.…But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true</l>
<l rend="indent">worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth,”13 etc.</l>
</lg>
</p>    
<p>We have seen that the hour promised by Malachi was supposed by the Ante-Nicene
Fathers to be here intended: “My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place
incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure offering.”14</p>
<p>The student of this series must have observed that the primitive writers were universally
impressed with these principles,15 and they are essential to the study of the liturgies here

introduced into the series by the Edinburgh editors. For other purposes, expounding the
prophetic system, on a text of St. Peter, Dean Payne-Smith has incidentally elucidated these
ideas so fully, and with such originality, that I leave the student to consult his pages,16 with
only the following important hints to those who may fail to see them:—</p>
<p>1. We find the prophet Samuel instituting “Schools of the Prophets,” out of which grew
the synagogue system supplying the Rabbinical education to Israel, and furnishing chiefs
to the synagogues. See Acts iii. 24; and compare 1 Sam. x. 5, xix. 20, and 1 Chron. ix. 22.17</p>
<p>2. We find the institution of choral worship and the chanting of hymns—e.g., of Moses
and Miriam, and Hannah (Samuel’s mother)—in full operation under Samuel.</p>
<p>3. We find David at this juncture inspired, as “the sweet singer of Israel,” to supply the
Psalter, which in divers arrangements has continued among Christians to be the marrow
of public worship “in every place,” and throughout the world.</p>
<p>4. The reading of the law and the prophets was now set in order; and not only was the
Temple supplied with teachers, but also the villages in every tribe.18</p>
<p>5. Thus the Christian Church was provided with a system of worship from the hour of
its institution,19 the synaxis succeeding the synagogue; the “ministration of the word” being
enriched by Gospels and Epistles, by psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and by “the
prayers” (based upon the Shemone esre)20 which now began to be composed and multiplied
in the churches. Touching “free prayer” as exemplified in the first ages, see St. Cyprian’s
Epistles more especially:21 “Let us pray for the lapsed,” etc.</p>
<p>6. It is most significant, that, as St. Paul was not present at the institution of the Lord’s
Supper, he was, nevertheless, “not behind the chiefest of the Apostles,” even in this. He also
“received” the whole knowledge of the institution, and became, in so far, the author of an
original Gospel in his details of Christ’s great oblation of Himself. Hereupon, he adds the
sacrificial expositions22 of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and “delivered the ordinances” to
every church23 (κατὰ τάξιν), providing for order and decorum in divine offices.</p>

<p>This he seems to have done as “Liturge” and “Hierurge,” or evangelical priest,24 “ministering

<p>Compare, then, with the Scriptures, Justin Martyr’s account of the early worship of
Christians; and after consulting the (so-called) “Clementine Liturgy,”26 the student will be
qualified to form an enlightened judgment upon the primitive and the interpolated elements
of the following liturgies. For we must bear in mind that they are reflected from mss., not
one of which has any claim to represent the Ante-Nicene period. To purify them, therefore,
by Scripture, and the truly primitive testimonies of this series, is a task yet remaining to be
accomplished, and one which may well invoke the most conscientious and patient labours
of the most learned in the land.</p>
<p>Here follows the Edinburgh Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The word Liturgy has a special meaning as applied to the following documents. It denotes
the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Various liturgies have come down to us from antiquity; and their age, authorship, and
genuineness have been matter of keen discussion. In our own country two writers on this
subject stand specially prominent: the Rev. William Palmer, M.A., who in his Origines
Liturgicæ27 gave a dissertation on Primitive Liturgies; and the Rev. J. Mason Neale, who
devoted a large portion of his life to liturgies, edited four of them in his Tetralogia Liturgica,28
five of them in his Liturgies of St. Mark, St. James, St. Clement, St. Chrysostom, and St. Basil,29
and discussed them in a masterly manner in several works, but especially in his General
Introduction to a History of the Holy Eastern Church 30</p>
<p>Ancient liturgies are generally divided into four families,—the Liturgy of the Jerusalem
Church,31 adopted throughout the East; the Alexandrian,32 used in Egypt and the neighbouring
countries; and the Roman and Gallican Liturgies. To these Neale has added a fifth,
the Liturgy of Persia or Edessa.</p>

<note type="footnote">32 [Called the Liturgy of St. Mark.]</note>

<pb n="1145"/>
<p>There is also a liturgy not included in any of these families—the Clementine. It seems
never to have been used in any public service. It forms part of the eighth book of the
Apostolical Constitutions.33</p>
<p>The age ascribed to these documents depends very much on the temperament and inclination
of the inquirer. Those who have great reverence for them think that they must
have had an apostolic origin, that they contain the apostolic form, first handed down by
tradition, and then committed to writing, but they allow that there is a certain amount of
interpolation and addition of a date later than the Nicene Council. Such words as “consubstantial”
and “mother of God” bear indisputable witness to this. Others think that there is
no real historical proof of their early existence at all,—that they all belong to a late date, and
bear evident marks of having been written long after the age of the apostles.34
There can scarcely be a doubt that they were not committed to writing till a comparatively
late day. Those who think that their origin was apostolic allow this. “The period,” says
Palmer,35 “when liturgies were first committed to writing is uncertain, and has been the
subject of some controversy. Le Brun contends that no liturgy was written till the fifth century;
but his arguments seem quite insufficient to prove this, and he is accordingly opposed
by Muratori and other eminent ritualists. It seems certain, on the other hand, that the liturgy
of the Apostolical Constitutions was written at the end of the third or beginning of the fourth
century; and there is no reason to deny that others may have been written about the same
time, or not long after.”</p>
<p>Neale36 sums up the results of his study in the following words: “I shall content myself
therefore with assuming, (1) that these liturgies, though not composed by the Apostles
whose names they bear, were the legitimate development of their unwritten tradition respecting
the Christian Sacrifice; the words, probably, in the most important parts, the general
tenor in all portions, descending unchanged from the apostolic authors. (2) That the Liturgy
of St. James is of earlier date, as to its main fabric, than a.d. 200; that the Clementine Office
is at least not later than 260; that the Liturgy of St. Mark is nearly coeval with that of St.
James; while those of St. Basil and St. Chrysostom are to be referred respectively to the saints
by whom they purport to be composed. In all these cases, several manifest insertions and
additions do not alter the truth of the general statement.”</p>
<note type="footnote">33 [It is most valuable, and indicates the usages of a period near the age of Justin Martyr. It is typical of an
original from which the Liturgy of St. James itself is derived. It was probably used in Gaul, if not also in Rome.]</note>

<p>1. The Roman Liturgy. The first writer who is supposed to allude to a Roman Liturgy
is Innocentius, in the beginning of the fifth century; but it may well be doubted whether his
words refer to any liturgy now extant.37 Some have attributed the authorship of the Roman
Liturgy to Leo the Great, who was made bishop of Rome in a.d. 451; some to Gelasius, who
was made bishop of Rome in a.d. 492; and some to Gregory the First, who was made bishop
of Rome in a.d. 590. Such being the opinions of those who have given most study to the
subject, we have not deemed it necessary to translate it, though Probst, in his Liturgie der
drei ersten christlichen Jahrhunderte,38 probably out of affection for his own Church, has
given it a place beside the Clementine and those of St. James and St. Mark.</p>
<p>2. The Gallican has still less claim to antiquity. In fact, Daniel marks it among the
spurious.39 Mabillon tries to prove that three ecclesiastics had a share in the authorship of
this liturgy: Musæus, presbyter of Marseilles, who died after the middle of the fifth century;
Sidonius, bishop of Auvergne, who died a.d. 494; and Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, who died
a.d. 366.40 Palmer strives to show with great ingenuity that it is not improbable that the
Gallican Liturgy may have been originally derived from St. John; but his arguments are
merely conjectures.</p>
<p>3. The Liturgy of St. James, the Liturgy of the Church of Jerusalem. Asseman, Zaccaria,
Dr. Brett, Palmer, Trollope, and Neale, think that the main structure of this liturgy is the
work of St. James, while they admit that it contains some evident interpolations. Leo Allatius,
Bona, Bellarmine, Baronius, and some others, think that the whole is the genuine production
of the apostle. Cave, Fabricius, Dupin, Le Nourry, Basnage, Tillemont, and many others,
think that it is entirely destitute of any claim to an apostolic origin, and that it belongs to a
much later age.41</p>
<p>“From the Liturgy of St. James,” says Neale, “are derived, on the one hand, the forty
Syro-Jacobite offices: on the other, the Cæsarean office, or Liturgy of St. Basil, with its offshoots;
that of St. Chrysostom, and the Armeno-Gregorian.”42</p>
<p>There are only two manuscripts of the Greek Liturgy of St. James,—one of the tenth,
the other of the twelfth century,—with fragments of a third.43 The first edition appeared at
Rome in 1526. In more recent times it has been edited by Rev. W. Trollope, M.A.,44 Neale
<note type="footnote">37 [If Justin Martyr describes the liturgy used in Rome, when he lived there under the Antonines, then it was

in the two works mentioned above, and Daniel in his Codex Liturgicus Bishop Rattray edited
the Anaphora,45 and attempted to separate the original from the interpolations, “though,”
says Neale, “the supposed restoration is unsatisfactory enough.” Bunsen, in his Analecta
Ante-Nicæna,46 has tried to restore the Anaphora to the state in which it may have been in
the fourth century, “as far as was possible—quantum fieri potuit ”</p>
<p>4. The Liturgy of St. Mark, the liturgy of the church of Alexandria. The same difference
of opinion exists in regard to the age and genuineness of this liturgy as we found existing
in regard to that of St. James, and the same scholars occupy the same relative position.
The offshoots from St. Mark’s Liturgy are St. Basil, St. Cyril, and St. Gregory, and the
Ethiopic Canon or Liturgy of All Apostles. In regard to the Liturgy of St. Cyril, Neale says
that it is “to all intents and purposes the same as that of St. Mark; and it seems highly
probable that the Liturgy of St. Mark came, as we have it now, from the hands of St. Cyril,
or, to use the expression of Abu’lberkat, that Cyril ‘perfected’ it.”47</p>
<p>There is only one manuscript of the Liturgy of St. Mark, probably belonging to the
twelfth century. The first edition appeared at Paris in 1583. The liturgy is given in Renaudot’s
Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio, tom. i. pp. 120–148,48 in Neale’s two works, and in
Daniel’s Codex Liturgicus</p>
<p>5. The Liturgy of the Apostles Adæus and Maris. This liturgy has been brought prominently
forward by Neale, who says: “It is generally passed over as of very inferior importance,
and Renaudot alone seems to have been prepared to acknowledge in some degree its great
antiquity.”49 He thinks that it is “one of the earliest, and perhaps the very earliest, of the
many formularies of the Christian Sacrifice.”50 It is one of the three Nestorian liturgies, the
other two being that of Nestorius and that of Theodore the interpreter.
A Latin translation of it is given in Renaudot’s Collectio,51 which is reprinted in Daniel’s
Codex Liturgicus It is from this version that our translation is made. Several prayers and
hymns are indicated only by the initial words, and the rubrical directions are probably of a
much later date than the text.</p>
<p>The Liturgies are divided into two parts,—the part before “Lift we up our hearts,” and
the part after this. The first is termed the Proanaphoral Part, the second the Anaphora.</p>

<p>Trollope describes what he conceives to be the form of worship in the early Church,
thus:52 “The service of this day divided itself into two parts; at the latter of which, called in
the Eastern churches Liturgia mystica, and in the Western Missa fidelium, none but perfect
and approved Christians were allowed to be present. To the Missa Catechumenorum, or
that part of the service which preceded the prayers peculiar to communicants only, not only
believers, but Gentiles, were admitted, in the hope that some might possibly become converts
to the faith. After the Psalms and Lessons with which the service commenced, as on ordinary
occasions, a section from the Acts of the Apostles or the Epistles was read; after which the
deacon or presbyter read the Gospel. Then followed an exhortation from one or more of
the presbyters; and the bishop or president delivered a Homily or Sermon, explanatory, it
should seem, of the Scripture which had been read, and exciting the people to an imitation
of the virtues therein exemplified. When the preacher had concluded his discourse with a
doxology in praise of the Holy Trinity, a deacon made proclamation for all infidels and noncommunicants
to withdraw; then came the dismissal of the several classes of catechumens,
energumens, competents, and penitents, after the prayers for each respectively, as on ordinary
days; and the Missa fidelium commenced. This office consisted of two parts, essentially
distinct: viz., of prayers for the faithful, and for mankind in general, introductory to the
Oblation; and the Anaphora or Oblation itself. The introductory part varied considerably
in the formularies of different churches; but in the Anaphora all the existing liturgies so
closely agree, in substance at least, if not in words, that they can only be reasonably referred
to the same common origin.53 Their arrangement, indeed, is not always the same; but the
following essential points belong, without exception, to them all:—1. The Kiss of Peace; 2.
The form beginning, Lift up your hearts; 3. The Hymn, Therefore with angels, etc.; 4. Commemoration
of the words of Institution; 5. The Oblation; 6. Prayer of Consecration; 7.
Prayers for the Church on Earth; 8. Prayers for the Dead; 9. The Lord’s Prayer; 10. Breaking
of the Bread; 11. Communion.”</p>
<p>Neale gives a more minute account of the different parts of the service. He divides the
Proanaphoral portion into parts in the following manner:54—</p>
<p>“Liturgy (or Missa) of the </p>
<p>Catechumens.</p>
<p>I. The Preparatory Prayers.</p>
<p>II.The Initial Hymn or Introit.</p>
<note type="footnote">52 Introduction, p. 11.</note>

<p>II. The Great Entrance.</p>

<p>“The great Eucharistic Prayer.</p>
<p>I. The Preface.</p>
<p>II.The Prayer of the Triumphal
Hymn.</p>

<p>I O Sovereign Lord our God, contemn me not, defiled with a multitude of sins: for, behold,
I have come to this Thy divine and heavenly mystery, not as being worthy; but looking
only to Thy goodness, I direct my voice to Thee: God be merciful to me, a sinner; I have
sinned against Heaven, and before Thee, and am unworthy to come into the presence of
this Thy holy and spiritual table, upon which Thy only-begotten Son, and our Lord Jesus
Christ, is mystically set forth as a sacrifice for me, a sinner, and stained with every spot.
Wherefore I present to Thee this supplication and thanksgiving, that Thy Spirit the Comforter
may be sent down upon me, strengthening and fitting me for this service; and count
me worthy to make known without condemnation the word, delivered from Thee by me to
the people, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy allholy,
and good, and quickening, and consubstantial69 Spirit, now and ever, and to all

<p>III Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ, O Word of God, who didst freely offer Thyself a
blameless sacrifice upon the cross to God even the Father, the coal of double nature, that
didst touch the lips of the prophet with the tongs, and didst take away his sins, touch also
the hearts of us sinners, and purify us from every stain, and present us holy beside Thy holy
altar, that we may offer Thee a sacrifice of praise: and accept from us, Thy unprofitable
servants, this incense as an odour of a sweet smell, and make fragrant the evil odour of our
soul and body, and purify us with the sanctifying power of Thy all-holy Spirit: for Thou
alone art holy, who sanctifiest, and art communicated to the faithful; and glory becomes
Thee, with Thy eternal Father, and Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and
ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>Prayer of the commencement.</p>
<p>IV O beneficent King eternal, and Creator of the universe, receive Thy Church, coming
unto Thee through Thy Christ: fulfil to each what is profitable; lead all to perfection, and
make us perfectly worthy of the grace of Thy sanctification, gathering us together within
Thy holy Church, which Thou hast purchased by the precious blood of Thy only-begotten
Son, and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom Thou art blessed and glorified, together
with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.
Amen.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>V Let us again pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Priest, prayer of the incense at the entrance of the congregation.
God, who didst accept the gifts of Abel, the sacrifice of Noah and of Abram, the incense
of Aaron and of Zacharias, accept also from the hand of us sinners this incense for an odour
of a sweet smell, and for remission of our sins, and those of all Thy people; for blessed art
Thou, and glory becomes Thee, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>Sir, pronounce the blessing.71</p>
<p>The Priest prays.</p>
<p>Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, who through exceeding goodness and love not to be
restrained wast crucified, and didst not refuse to be pierced by the spear and nails; who didst

provide this mysterious and awful service as an everlasting memorial for us perpetually:
bless Thy ministry in Christ the God, and bless our entrance, and fully complete the
presentation of this our service by Thy unutterable compassion, now and ever, and to all
eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>The responsive prayer from the Deacon.</p>
<p>VI. The Lord bless us, and make us worthy seraphically to offer gifts, and to sing the
oft-sung hymn of the divine Trisagion, by the fulness and exceeding abundance of all the
perfection of holiness, now and ever.</p>
<p>Then the Deacon begins to sing in the entrance.72</p>
<p>Thou who art the only-begotten Son and Word of God, immortal; who didst submit
for our salvation to become flesh of the holy God-mother,73 and ever-virgin Mary; who
didst immutably become man and wast crucified, O Christ our God, and didst by Thy death
tread death underfoot; who art one of the Holy Trinity glorified together with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, save us.</p>
<p>The Priest says this prayer from the gates to the altar.</p>
<p>VII God Almighty, Lord great in glory, who hast given to us an entrance into the Holy
of Holies, through the sojourning among men of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord, and
God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, we supplicate and invoke Thy goodness, since we are fearful
and trembling when about to stand at Thy holy altar; send forth upon us, O God, Thy good
grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and turn our thoughts to piety, in order
that with a pure conscience we may bring unto Thee gifts, offerings, and fruits for the remission
of our transgressions, and for the propitiation of all Thy people, by the grace and
mercies and loving-kindness of Thy only-begotten Son, with whom Thou art blessed to all
eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>After the approach to the altar, the Priest says:—</p>
<p>VIII. Peace be to all.</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>And to thy spirit.</p>

temptation of the devil and of man; withhold not Thy aid from us, nor bring on us chastisements
too heavy for our strength: for we are unable to overcome what is opposed to us; but
Thou art able, Lord, to save us from everything that is against us. Save us, O God, from the
difficulties of this world, according to Thy goodness, in order that, having drawn nigh with
a pure conscience to Thy holy altar, we may send up to Thee without condemnation the
blessed hymn Trisagion, together with the heavenly powers, and that, having performed
the service, well pleasing to Thee and divine, we may be counted worthy of eternal life.</p>

Priest says the prayer of incense.</p>
<p>Sovereign Almighty, King of Glory, who knowest all things before their creation,
manifest Thyself to us calling upon Thee at this holy hour, and redeem us from the shame
of our transgressions; cleanse our mind and our thoughts from impure desires, from worldly

O Sovereign Lord, who hast visited us in compassion and mercies, and hast freely given
to us, Thy humble and sinful and unworthy servants, boldness to stand at Thy holy altar,
and to offer to Thee this dread and bloodless sacrifice for our sins, and for the errors of the
people, look upon me Thy unprofitable servant, and blot out my transgressions for Thy
compassion’s sake; and purify my lips and heart from all pollution of flesh and spirit; and
remove from me every shameful and foolish thought, and fit me by the power of Thy allholy
Spirit for this service; and receive me graciously by Thy goodness as I draw nigh to Thy
altar.</p>
<p>And be pleased, O Lord, that these gifts brought by our hands may be acceptable,
stooping to my weakness; and cast me not away from Thy presence, and abhor not my unworthiness;
but pity me according to Thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of
Thy mercies pass by my transgressions, that, having come before Thy glory without condemnation,
I may be counted worthy of the protection of Thy only-begotten Son, and of the illumination
of Thy all-holy Spirit, that I may not be as a slave of sin cast out, but as Thy
servant may find grace and mercy and forgiveness of sins before Thee, both in the world
that now is and in that which is to come.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, Almighty Sovereign, all-powerful Lord, hear my prayer; for Thou art

As Thou didst accept from the hand of Thy apostles this true service, so accept also in Thy
goodness from the hands of us sinners these offered gifts; and grant that our offering may

place of the tabernacle of Thy glory, and to be within the veil, and to behold the Holy of
Holies, cast ourselves down before Thy goodness:</p>

errors of the people:95 send forth, O God, Thy good grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies,

delivered Himself up for the life and salvation of the world,</p>
<p>Then the Priest holds the bread in his hand, and says:—</p>
<p>XXX. Having taken the bread in His holy and pure and blameless and immortal hands,
lifting up His eyes to heaven, and showing it to Thee, His God and Father, He gave thanks,
and hallowed, and brake, and gave it to us,101 His disciples and apostles, saying:—</p>
<p>The Deacons say:102</p>
<p>For the remission of sins and life everlasting.</p>
<p>Then he says aloud:—</p>
<p>Take, eat: this is my body, broken for you, and given for remission of sins.</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Then he takes the cup, and says:—</p>
<p>In like manner, after supper, He took the cup, and having mixed wine and water, lifting
up His eyes to heaven, and presenting it to Thee, His God and Father, He gave thanks, and
hollowed and blessed it, and filled it with the Holy Spirit, and gave it to us His disciples,
saying, Drink ye all of it; this is my blood of the new testament shed for you and many, and
distributed for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>The Priest.</p>
<p>This do in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
do show forth the Lord’s death, and confess His resurrection, till He come.</p>
<p>The Deacons say:—</p>
<p>We believe and confess:</p>
<p>The People.</p>

<p>The Priest (Oblation).</p>
<p>XXXI. Remembering, therefore, His life-giving sufferings, His saving cross, His death
and His burial, and resurrection from the dead on the third day, and His ascension into
heaven, and sitting at the right hand of Thee, our God and Father, and His second glorious
and awful appearing, when He shall come with glory to judge the quick and the dead, and
render to every one according to His works; even we, sinful men, offer unto Thee, O Lord,
this dread and bloodless sacrifice, praying that Thou wilt not deal with us after our sins, nor
reward us according to our iniquities;</p>
<p>But that Thou, according to Thy mercy and Thy unspeakable loving-kindness, passing
by and blotting out the handwriting against us Thy suppliants, wilt grant to us Thy heavenly
and eternal gifts (which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which have not
entered into the heart of man103) that thou hast prepared, O God, for those who love Thee;
and reject not, O loving Lord, the people for my sake, or for my sin’s sake:
Then he says, thrice:—</p>
<p>For Thy people and Thy Church supplicate Thee.</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>Have mercy on us, O Lord our God, Father Almighty.</p>
<p>Again the Priest says (Invocation):—</p>
<p>XXXII. Have mercy upon us, O God Almighty.</p>
<p>Have mercy upon us, O God our Saviour.</p>
<p>Have mercy upon us, O God, according to Thy great mercy, and send forth on us, and</p>
<p>on these offered gifts, Thy all-holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Then, bowing his neck, he says:—</p>
<p>The sovereign and quickening Spirit, that sits upon the throne with Thee, our God and
Father, and with Thy only-begotten Son, reigning with Thee; the consubstantial104 and coeternal;
that spoke in the law and in the prophets, and in Thy New Testament; that descended
in the form of a dove on our Lord Jesus Christ at the river Jordan, and abode on Him; that
descended on Thy apostles in the form of tongues of fire in the upper room of the holy and
glorious Zion on the day of Pentecost: this Thine all-holy Spirit, send down, O Lord, upon
us, and upon these offered holy gifts;</p>

That coming, by His holy and good and glorious appearing, He may sanctify this bread,
and make it the holy body of Thy Christ.105</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>The Priest.</p>
<p>And this cup the precious blood of Thy Christ.</p>
<p>The People.</p>

<p>The Priest by himself standing.</p>
<p>XXXIII. That they may be to all that partake of them for remission of sins, and for life
everlasting, for the sanctification of souls and of bodies, for bearing the fruit of good works,
for the stablishing of Thy Holy Catholic Church, which Thou hast founded on the Rock of
Faith,106 that the gates of hell may not prevail against it; delivering it from all heresy and
scandals, and from those who work iniquity, keeping it till the fulness of the time.</p>
<p>And having bowed, he says:—
XXXIV. We present them to Thee also, O Lord, for the holy places, which Thou hast
glorified by the divine appearing of Thy Christ, and by the visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit;
especially for the glorious Zion, the mother of all the churches;107 and for Thy Holy, Catholic,
and Apostolic Church throughout the world: even now, O Lord, bestow upon her the
rich gifts of Thy all-holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Remember also, O Lord, our holy fathers and brethren in it, and the bishops in all the
world, who rightly divide the word of Thy truth.</p>
<p>Remember also, O Lord, every city and country, and those of the true faith dwelling in
them, their peace and security.</p>

fathers and brethren, who are in bonds, prison, captivity, and exile; who are in mines, and

<p>Remember, O Lord, our fathers and brethren, toiling hard, and ministering unto us,
for Thy holy name’s sake.</p>
<p>Remember all, O Lord, for good: have mercy on all, O Lord, be reconciled to us all: give
peace to the multitudes of Thy people: put away scandals: bring wars to an end: make the
uprising of heresies to cease: grant Thy peace and Thy love to us, O God our Saviour, the
hope of all the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Remember, O Lord, favourable weather, peaceful showers, beneficent dews, abundance
of fruits, and to crown the year with Thy goodness; for the eyes of all wait on Thee, and
Thou givest their food in due season: thou openest Thy hand, and fillest every living thing
with gladness.</p>
<p>Remember, O Lord, those who bear fruit, and labour honourably in the holy108 of Thy
Church; and those who forget not the poor, the widows, the orphans, the strangers, and the
needy; and all who have desired us to remember them in our prayers.
Moreover, O Lord, be pleased to remember those who have brought these offerings this
day to Thy holy altar, and for what each one has brought them or with what mind, and those
persons who have just now been mentioned to Thee.</p>
<p>Remember, O Lord, according to the multitude of Thy mercy and compassion, me also,
Thy humble and unprofitable servant; and the deacons who surround Thy holy altar, and
graciously give them a blameless life, keep their ministry undefiled, and purchase for them
a good degree, that we may find mercy and grace, with all the saints that have been well
pleasing to Thee since the world began, to generation and generation—grandsires, sires,
patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, teachers, saints, and every just spirit
made perfect in the faith of Thy Christ.</p>

of whom we have not made mention, who are of the true faith, from righteous Abel unto
this day: unto them do Thou give rest there in the land of the living, in Thy kingdom, in the
joy of paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, our holy fathers;

blessed to all eternity, who sittest upon the cherubim, and art glorified by the seraphim,

odour of a sweet spiritual smell, and hast been pleased to sanctify them, and make them
perfect, O good One, by the grace of Thy Christ, and by the presence of Thy all-holy Spirit.</p>

tribulation and distress, needing the mercy and succour of God, and for the return of the
erring, the healing of the sick, the deliverance of the captives, the rest of our fathers and brethren
who have fallen asleep aforetime;</p>

left, and dips that in his right hand in the chalice, saying:—</p>
<p>The union of the all-holy body and precious blood of our Lord and God and Saviour,
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Then he makes the sign of the cross on that in his left hand: then with that which has been
signed the other half: then forthwith he begins to divide, and before all to give to each chalice
a single piece, saying:—</p>
<p>It has been made one, and sanctified, and perfected, in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever.</p>
<p>And when he makes the sign of the cross on the bread, he says:—</p>
<p>Behold the Lamb of God, the Son of the Father, that taketh away the sin of the world,
sacrificed for the life and salvation of the world.</p>
<p>And when he gives a single piece to each chalice he says:—</p>

In the peace of Christ let us go on:</p>
<p>The People.</p>
<p>In the name of the Lord. Sir, pronounce the blessing.130
Dismission prayer, spoken by the Deacon.</p>
<p>Going on from glory to glory, we praise Thee, the Saviour of our souls. Glory to Father,
and Son, and Holy Spirit now and ever, and to all eternity. We praise Thee, the Saviour of
our souls.</p>
<p>The Priest says a prayer from the altar to the sacristy.</p>
<p>XLIX. Going on from strength to strength, and having fulfilled all the divine service in
Thy temple, even now we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, make us worthy of perfect lovingkindness;
make straight our path: root us in Thy fear, and make us worthy of the heavenly
kingdom, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy,
and good, and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>L. Again and again, and at all times, in peace let us beseech the Lord.</p>
<p>Prayer said in the sacristy after the dismissal.</p>
<p>Thou hast given unto us, O Lord, sanctification in the communion of the all-holy body
and precious blood of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; give unto us also the
grace of Thy good Spirit, and keep us blameless in the faith, lead us unto perfect adoption
and redemption, and to the coming joys of eternity; for Thou art our sanctification and
light, O God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all
eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>In the peace of Christ let us keep watch.</p>

<p>The Priest.</p>
<p>Blessed is God, who blesseth and sanctifieth through the communion of the holy, and
quickening, and pure mysteries, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>Then the prayer of propitiation.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, Lamb and Shepherd, who takest away the
sin of the world, who didst freely forgive their debt to the two debtors, and gavest remission
of her sins to the woman that was a sinner, who gavest healing to the paralytic, with the remission
of his sins; forgive, remit, pardon, O God, our offences, voluntary and involuntary,
in knowledge and in ignorance, by transgression and by disobedience, which Thy all-holy
Spirit knows better than Thy servants do:</p>
<p>And if men, carnal and dwelling in this world, have in aught erred from Thy commandments,
either moved by the devil, whether in word or in deed, or if they have come under
a curse, or by reason of some special vow, I entreat and beseech Thy unspeakable lovingkindness,
that they may be set free from their word, and released from the oath and the
special vow, according to Thy goodness.</p>
<p>Verily, O Sovereign Lord, hear my supplication on behalf of Thy servants, and do Thou
pass by all their errors, remembering them no more; forgive them every transgression, voluntary
and involuntary; deliver them from everlasting punishment: for Thou art He that
hast commanded us, saying, Whatsoever things ye bind upon earth, shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever things ye loose upon earth, shall be loosed in heaven: for, thou art
our God, a God able to pity, and to save and to forgive sins; and glory is due unto Thee, with
the eternal Father, and the quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</p>

conscience, and cleanse our hearts from all pollution. Drive away from us all unholy thoughts,

<p>O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, look down from heaven on Thy Church, on all Thy
people, and on all Thy flock. Save us all, Thy unworthy servants, the sheep of Thy fold. Give
us Thy peace, Thy help, and Thy love, and send to us the gift of Thy Holy Spirit, that with
a pure heart and a good conscience we may salute one another with an holy kiss, without
hypocrisy, and with no hostile purpose, but guileless and pure in one spirit, in the bond of
peace and love, one body and one spirit, in one faith, even as we have been called in one
hope of our calling, that we may all meet in the divine and boundless love, in Christ Jesus
our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed.</p>
<p>Then the Priest offers the incense, and says:—
The incense is offered to Thy name. Let it ascend, we implore Thee, from the hands of
Thy poor and sinful servants to Thy heavenly altar for a sweet-smelling savour, and the
propitiation of all Thy people. For all glory, honour, adoration, and thanks are due unto

worthy of receiving the manifestation of Thy beloved from Thy holy heavens: there shall
we render thanks unto Thee, and, in the meantime, glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy
Church, crowned and filled with every aid and blessing, because Thou art Lord and Father,
Creator of all.</p>
<p>III. Prayer of Incense.</p>
<p>We shall repeat the hymn to Thy glorious Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>On fast-days.</p>
<p>And on account, etc.</p>
<p>At the commemoration of saints.</p>
<p>Thou, O Lord, art truly the raiser up of our bodies: Thou art the good Saviour of our
souls, and the secure preserver of our life; and we ought to thank Thee continually, to adore
and glorify Thee, O Lord of all.</p>
<p>At the lessons.206</p>
<p>Holy art Thou, worthy of praise, mighty, immortal, who dwellest in the holies, and Thy
will resteth in them: have regard unto us, O Lord; be merciful unto us, and pity us, as Thou
art our helper in all circumstances, O Lord of all.</p>
<p>IV. At the apostle.207</p>
<note type="footnote">205 “The psalm, or verses of a psalm, sung after the Epistle, was always entitled gradual, from being chanted
on the steps (gradus) of the pulpit. When sung by one person without interruption, it was called tractus; when
chanted alternately by several singers, it was termed responsory.”—Palmer, Origines Liturgicæ, vol. ii. p. 46, note.</note>

<p>To Thee, the wise governor, etc.</p>
<p>V. Descending, he shall salute the Gospel, saying this prayer before the altar.</p>
<p>Thee, the renowned seed of Thy Father, and the image of the person of Thy Father, who
wast revealed in the body of our humanity, and didst arise to us in the light of Thy annunciation,
Thee we thank, adore, etc.</p>
<p>And after the proclamation:208—</p>
<p>Thee, O Lord God Almighty, we beseech and entreat, perfect with us Thy grace, and
pour out through our hands Thy gift, the pity and compassion of Thy divinity. May they
be to us for the propitiation of the offences of Thy people, and for the forgiveness of the sins
of the entire flock of Thy pasture, through Thy grace and tender mercies, O good friend of
men, O Lord of all.</p>
<p>VI. The Deacons say:—</p>
<p>Bow your heads.</p>
<p>The Priest says this secret prayer in the sanctuary:209—</p>
<p>O Lord God Omnipotent, Thine is the Holy Catholic Church, inasmuch as Thou,
through the great passion of Thy Christ, didst buy the sheep of Thy pasture; and from the
grace of the Holy Spirit, who is indeed of one nature with Thy glorious divinity, are granted
the degrees of the true priestly ordination; and through Thy clemency Thou didst vouchsafe,
O Lord, to make our weakness spiritual members in the great body of Thy Holy Church,
that we might administer spiritual aid to faithful souls. Now, O Lord, perfect Thy grace with
us, and pour out Thy gift through our hands: and may Thy tender mercies and the clemency
of Thy divinity be upon us, and upon the people whom Thou hast chosen for Thyself.</p>
<p>(Aloud.)</p>

<p>And grant unto us, O Lord, through Thy clemency, that we may all together, and equally
every day of our life, please Thy divinity, and be rendered worthy of the aid of Thy grace to
offer Thee praise, honour, thanksgiving, and adoration at all times, O Lord.</p>
<p>VII. And the Deacons ascend to the altar, and say:—</p>
<p>He who has not received baptism, etc.210</p>
<p>And the Priest begins the responsory of the mysteries,211 and the Sacristan and Deacon
place the disk and the chalice upon the altar. The Priest crosses his hands, and says:212—</p>
<p>We offer praise to Thy glorious Trinity at all times and for ever.</p>
<p>And proceeds:—</p>
<p>May Christ, who was offered for our salvation, and commanded us to commemorate
His death and His resurrection, Himself receive this sacrifice from the hands of our weakness,
through His grace and mercies for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>And proceeds:—</p>
<p>Laid are the renowned holy and life-giving mysteries upon the altar of the mighty Lord,
even until His advent, for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>Praise, etc.</p>

which he kisses, then the right and the left horn of the altar; and bows to the Gospel side, and
says:—</p>

and power to perform this service to which I have drawn near, and that this oblation
may be accepted from the hands of my weakness, for myself, for you, and for the whole
body of the Holy Catholic Church, through His grace and mercies for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>And they respond:—</p>
<p>May Christ listen to thy prayers, and be pleased with thy sacrifice, receive thy oblation,
and honour thy priesthood, and grant unto us, through thy mediation,215 the pardon of
our offences, and the forgiveness of our sins, through His grace and mercies for ever.</p>
<p>Presently he bows at the other side, uttering the same words; and they respond in the same
manner: then he bows to the altar, and says:—</p>
<p>God, Lord of all, be with us through His grace and mercies for ever.Amen.</p>
<p>And bowing towards the Deacon, who is on the left (Epistle side), he says:—</p>
<p>God, the Lord of all, confirm thy words, and secure to thee peace, and accept this oblation
from my hands for me, for thee, for the whole body of the Holy Catholic Church, and for
the entire world, through His grace and mercies for ever.</p>
<p>He kneels at the altar, and says in secret:—</p>
<p>IX. O our Lord and God, look not on the multitude of our sins, and let not Thy dignity
be turned away on account of the heinousness of our iniquities; but through Thine unspeakable
grace sanctify this sacrifice of Thine, and grant through it power and capability, so that
Thou mayest forget our many sins, and be merciful when Thou shalt appear at the end of
time, in the man whom Thou hast assumed from among us, and we may find before Thee
grace and mercy, and be rendered worthy to praise Thee with spiritual216 assemblies.</p>
<p>He rises, and says this prayer in secret:—</p>
<p>We thank Thee, O our Lord and God, for the abundant riches of Thy grace to us:</p>
<p>And he proceeds:—</p>
<p>Us who were sinful and degraded, on account of the multitude of Thy clemency, Thou
hast made worthy to celebrate the holy mysteries of the body and blood of Thy Christ. We
beg aid from Thee for the strengthening of our souls, that in perfect love and true faith we
may administer Thy gift to us.</p>

<p>Peace be with you:</p>
<p>They respond:—</p>
<p>With thee and with thy spirit.</p>
<p>And they give the (kiss of) peace to each other, and say:—</p>
<p>For all:217</p>
<p>The Deacon says:—</p>
<p>Let us thank, entreat, and beseech.</p>
<p>The Priest says this prayer in secret:—</p>
<p>O Lord, mighty God, help my weakness through Thy clemency and the aid of Thy grace;
and make me worthy of offering before Thee this oblation, as for the common aid of all,
and to the praise of Thy Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Another prayer.218</p>
<p>O our Lord and God, restrain our thoughts, that they wander not amid the vanities of
this world. O Lord our God, grant that I may be united to the affection of Thy love, unworthy

humility; and under the wings of Thy grace hide me through Thy mercy. If Thou wert to
mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? Because there is mercy with Thee.</p>
<p>[The Priest says the following prayer in secret:219—</p>

<p>XI. When the Deacon shall say, With watchfulness and care, etc., immediately the Priest
rises up and uncovers the sacraments, taking away the veil with which they were covered: he
blesses the incense, and says a canon with a loud voice:—</p>
<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion
of the Holy Ghost, be with us all, now, etc.220</p>
<p>He signs the sacraments, and they respond:—</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>The Priest proceeds:—</p>
<p>Lift up your minds:</p>
<p>They respond:—</p>
<p>They are towards Thee, O God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, O glorious King.</p>
<p>The Priest.</p>
<p>The oblation is offered to God, the Lord of all.</p>
<p>They respond:—</p>
<p>It is meet and right.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>Peace be with you.</p>
<p>The Priest puts on the incense, and says this prayer:—</p>
<p>O Lord, Lord, grant me an open countenance before Thee, that with the confidence
which is from Thee we may fulfil this awful and divine sacrifice with consciences free from
all iniquity and bitterness. Sow in us, O Lord, affection, peace, and concord towards each
other, and toward every one.</p>
<p>And standing, he says in secret:221—</p>

and exaltation from all creatures, is the adorable and glorious name of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, who created the world through His grace, and its inhabitants through His

clemency, who saved men through His mercy, and showed great favour towards mortals.
Thy majesty, O Lord, thousands of thousands of heavenly spirits, and ten thousand myriads
of holy angels, hosts of spirits, ministers of fire and spirit, bless and adore; with the holy
cherubim and the spiritual seraphim they sanctify and celebrate Thy name, crying and
praising, without ceasing crying unto each other.</p>
<p>They say with a loud voice:—</p>
<p>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty; full are the heavens and the earth of His glory.</p>
<p>The Priest in secret:—</p>
<p>Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord God Almighty; the heavens and the earth are full of
His glory and the nature of His essence, as they are glorious with the honour of His
splendour; as it is written, The heaven and the earth are full of me, saith the mighty Lord.</p>
<p>Holy art Thou, O God our Father, truly the only one, of whom the whole family in
heaven and earth is named. Holy art Thou, Eternal Son, through whom all things were made.
Holy art Thou, Holy, Eternal Spirit, through whom all things are sanctified.</p>
<p>Woe to me, woe to me, who have been astonied, because I am a man of polluted lips,
and dwell among a people of polluted lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the mighty Lord.
How terrible to-day is this place! For this is none other than the house of God and the gate
of heaven; because Thou hast been seen eye to eye, O Lord.</p>
<p>Now, I pray, may Thy grace be with us, O Lord; purge away our impurities, and sanctify
our lips; unite the voices of our insignificance with the sanctification of seraphim and
archangels. Glory be to Thy tender mercies, because Thou hast associated the earthly with
the heavenly.222</p>
<p>And he proceeds, saying in secret this prayer, in a bowing posture:—</p>
<p>XII. And with those heavenly powers we give Thee thanks, even we, Thine insignificant,
pithless, and feeble servants; because Thou hast granted unto us Thy great grace which cannot
be repaid. For indeed Thou didst take upon Thee our human nature, that Thou mightest bestow
life on us through Thy divinity; Thou didst exalt our low condition; Thou didst raise our ruined
state; Thou didst rouse up our mortality; Thou didst wash away our sins; Thou didst blot out
the guilt of our sins; Thou didst enlighten our intelligence, and Thou didst condemn our enemy,
O Lord our God; and Thou didst cause the insignificance of our pithless nature to triumph.</p>

<p>Through the tender mercies of Thy grace poured out, O clement One, pardon our offences
and sins; blot out my offences in the judgment. And on account of all Thy aids and
Thy favours to us, we shall ascribe unto Thee praise,224 honour, thanksgiving, and adoration,
now, always, and for ever and ever.</p>
<p>The Priest signs the sacraments. The response is made.
Amen.</p>
<p>The Deacon.</p>
<p>In your minds. Pray for peace with us.</p>
<p>The Priest says this prayer225 bowing, and in a low voice:—</p>
<p>O Lord God Almighty, accept this oblation for the whole Holy Catholic Church, and
for all the pious and righteous fathers who have been pleasing to Thee, and for all the
prophets and apostles, and for all the martyrs and confessors, and for all that mourn, that
are in straits, and are sick, and for all that are under difficulties and trials, and for all the
weak and the oppressed, and for all the dead that have gone from amongst us; then for all
that ask a prayer from our weakness, and for me, a degraded and feeble sinner. O Lord our
God, according to Thy mercies and the multitude of Thy favours, look upon Thy people,
and on me, a feeble man, not according to my sins and my follies, but that they may become
worthy of the forgiveness of their sins through this holy body, which they receive with faith,
through the grace of Thy mercy for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>The Priest says this prayer of inclination in secret:—</p>
<p>XIII. Do Thou, O Lord, through Thy many and ineffable mercies, make the memorial
good and acceptable with that of226 all the pious and righteous fathers who have been
pleading before Thee in the commemoration of the body and blood of Thy Christ, which
we offer to Thee upon Thy pure and holy altar, as Thou hast taught us; and grant unto us
Thy rest all the days of this life.</p>

<note type="footnote">225 In another ms. that prayer begins thus:— O Lord God Almighty, hear the voice of my cry before Thee

creatures; spare the guilty; convert the erring; restore the oppressed; on the disquieted bestow rest; heal the weak;
console the afflicted; and perfect the alms of those who work righteousness on account of Thy holy name. Have
mercy on me also, a sinner, through Thy grace. O Lord God Almighty, may this oblation be accepted for the

<p>O Lord our God, bestow on us Thy rest and peace all the days of this life, that all the
inhabitants of the earth may know Thee, that Thou art the only true God the Father, and
Thou didst send our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son and Thy beloved; and He Himself our Lord
and God came and taught us all purity and holiness. Make remembrance of prophets,
apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops, doctors, priests, deacons, and all the sons of the Holy
Catholic Church who have been signed with the sign of life, of holy baptism. We also, O
Lord:</p>

mystery of the passion, death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And may Thy Holy Spirit come, O Lord,227 and rest upon this oblation of Thy servants
which they offer, and bless and sanctify it; and may it be unto us, O Lord, for the propitiation
of our offences and the forgiveness of our sins, and for a grand hope of resurrection from
the dead, and for a new life in the kingdom of the heavens, with all who have been pleasing
before Him. And on account of the whole of Thy wonderful dispensation towards us, we
shall render thanks unto Thee, and glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy Church, redeemed

Thy mercies remain upon me, O Lord, for ever, and despise not the works of Thy hands.231</p>
<p>Then he says this prayer:—</p>
<p>XIV. O Christ, peace of those in heaven and great rest of those below,232 grant that Thy
rest and peace may dwell in the four parts of the world,233 but especially in Thy Holy
Catholic Church; grant that the priesthood with the government may have peace; cause
wars to cease from the ends of the earth, and scatter the nations that delight in wars,234 that
we may enjoy the blessing of living in tranquillity and peace, in all temperance and fear of
God. Spare the offences and sins of the dead, through Thy grace and mercies for ever.</p>
<p>And to those who are around the altar he says:—</p>
<p>Bless, O Lord. Bless, O Lord.</p>
<p>And he puts on the incense with which he fumes himself, and says:—</p>
<p>Sweeten, O Lord our God, the unpleasing savour235 of our souls through the sweetness
of Thy love, and through it cleanse me from the stains of my sin, and forgive me my offences
and sins, whether known or unknown to me.</p>
<p>A second time he takes the incense with both hands, and censes the mysteries; presently
he says:—</p>
<p>The clemency of Thy grace, O our Lord and God, gives us access to these renowned,
holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, unworthy though we be.</p>
<p>The Priest repeats these words once and again, and at each interval unites his hands over
his breast in the form of a cross. He kisses the altar in the middle, and receives with both hands
the upper oblation; and looking up, says:—</p>
<p>Praise be to Thy holy name, O Lord Jesus Christ, and adoration to Thy majesty, always

do not touch it, but appear to kiss it; and he says:—</p>
<p>Glory to Thee, O Lord; glory to Thee, O Lord, on account of Thine unspeakable gift to
us, for ever.</p>
<p>Then he draws nigh to the fraction of the host,240 which he accomplishes with both his
hands, saying:—</p>
<p>We draw nigh, O Lord, with true faith, and break with thanksgiving and sign through
Thy mercy the body and blood of our Life-giver, Jesus Christ, in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>And, naming the Trinity, he breaks the host,241 which he holds in his hands, into two
parts: and the one which is in his left hand he lays down on the disk; with the other, which he
holds in his right hand, he signs the chalice, saying:—</p>

the paten, saying:—ö</p>

name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost for ever.</p>
<p>And they respond:—</p>

<p>And he unites the two parts, the one with the other, saying:—</p>
<p>Divided, sanctified, completed, perfected, united, and commingled have been these
renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, the one with the other, in the adorable
and glorious name of Thy glorious Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that they may
be to us, O Lord, for the propitiation of our offences and the forgiveness of our sins; also
for the grand hope of a resurrection from the dead, and of a new life in the kingdom of the
heavens, for us and for the Holy Church of Christ our Lord, here and in every place whatsoever,
now and always, and for ever.</p>
<p>XVII. In the meantime he signs the host242 with his right thumb in the form of a cross
from the lower part to the upper, and from the right to the left, and thus forms a slight fissure
in it where it has been dipped in the blood. He puts a part of it into the chalice in the form of
a cross: the lower part is placed towards the priest, the upper towards the chalice, so that the
place of the fissure looks to the chalice. He bows, and rising, says:—
Glory be to Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, who hast made me, unworthy though I be, through Thy grace, a minister and mediator of Thy
renowed, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries: through the grace of Thy mercy, make me worthy of the pardon of my offences and the forgiveness
of my sins.</p>
<p>He signs himself with the sign of the cross an his forehead, and does the same to those
standing round him.243</p>
<p>The Deacons approach, and he signs each one of them on the forehead, saying:—</p>

<p>I.
(Disciple of the holy Peter, p. 551.)</p>
<p>The early use of the originals of this liturgy in the Alexandrian patriarchate accounts
for its bearing the name of St. Mark,—“sister’s son to Barnabas,” as St. Paul calls him.248
That he was St. Peter’s pupil may be inferred from that Apostle’s language,249—”Marcus,
my son.” See Clement’s testimony concerning him (with Eusebius) in vol. ii. pp. 579, 580,
this series. That he founded the “Evangelical See,” though resting on great historic author-
ity,250 seems to be doubted in our times by some.</p>

<p>II.
(Our holy father Mark, p. 556.)</p>
<p>While St. Mark could not have written this, it may, of course, have been added at a very
early date.251 This most touching prayer bears marks of great antiquity, the reference to our
“Christ-loving sovereign” comporting better with the early enthusiasm inspired by
Constantine’s conversion than with the disappointments incurred under his Arianizing or
apostate successors. Now, this commemoration of St. Mark would of itself attach his name
to the liturgy.</p>
<p>But here is the place to note the principles of these primitive prayers for saints departed.
(1) They could only be offered in behalf of the holy dead who had fallen asleep in full communion
with Christ and His Church; (2) They were not prayers for their deliverance out of
one place into another; (3) They recognised the repose (not yet the triumph) of the faithful
departed as incomplete, and hence (4) invoked for them a blessed consummation of peace
and joy in the resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, all this is fatal to the Roman dogmas and usages, because (1) they thus include St.
Mark and the Blessed Virgin in these commemorations; while Rome teaches, not only that
these great saints went immediately to the excellent glory, and there have reigned with Christ
ever since they died, but (2) that on this very ground, and that of their supererogatory merits,
the Pontiff holds a purse252 of their excessive righteousness to dispense to meaner Christians.</p>

<p>St. Augustine speaks of his dear Nebridius as in Abraham’s bosom,253 but finds comfort
in commemorating him and Monica his mother, “because it is so comfortable.” This is his
idea, in a word: “Et credo jam feceris quod te rogo, sed (Ps. cxix. 108) voluntaria oris mei,
approba, Domine.”</p>

<p>III.
(Holy things for the holy, p. 559.)</p>
<p>Bingham254 has so fully elucidated this by quotations from Chrysostom (Hom. vii.) and
others, that one might think it useless to attach to it any other meaning than that which
Chrysostom understands in it; viz., “Holy things for holy persons.” It occurs just before the
communicating of the faithful, and has nothing whatever to do with the “elevation of the
host,”—a Western ceremony of the fourteenth century.255 Yet, in an otherwise (generally)
useful manual of liturgies, an attempt is made to give it this meaning; and the preceding
prayer of “Intense Adoration,” addressed to the Great High Priest in the heavens, is debased
to eke out the weak idea. Nothing could be more averse to the primitive principle of worship;
256 but it is sufficient to note the fact that the “elevation of the host” revolutionized the
eucharistic worship of the West as soon as it was established. (1) It abolished the Eucharist
practically as the synaxis, or communion of the faithful, and made it only a sacrifice for them
in their behalf; (2) not to be eaten and received, but to be gazed at; (3) not for all the faithful
at all times, excluding even catechumens from beholding it, but to be displayed to all eyes
in pompous ceremonials, carried through the streets, and dispensed only in half-communion,
once a year, to the individual communicant. All these ancient liturgies, corrupted as they
are in all the mss. we possess, are yet liturgies for communicating the faithful, in their
turns,257 one and all; and, so far, they are true to the Scriptures and the precepts of Christ
and His Apostles. But well does the pious Hirscher exclaim, with reference to the Mass, as
he was obliged to celebrate it in his own gorgeous cathedral at Freiburg in the Breisgau:
“What would an Apostle think we were doing, should he enter during our ceremonies?”
Also, “I know all that can be said in their favour. I know just as well that by them the spirit
is turned apart from internal godliness, and borne away; and that, with such appeals to sense,
withdrawal from things of sense becomes impossible.…God is a Spirit: He looks to be adored
in spirit and in truth, and all ceremonial which dulls the adoration258 of the spirit is odious

to God. To glorify self, as His minister, before the King of kings, before the majesty of the
Creator, before His Christ, naked and crucified,—is it not an absurdity, a ceremony of
contradictions? The people no longer comprehend the ceremonial…to see them satisfied
by mere corporal attendance, is it not deplorable? They do not understand Latin. Is it not
melancholy that they take no real part in the touching offices of the Holy Week? Is not a
deplorable indifference the result; in France, for example? Nay, at Rome also?”259</p>
<p>His remonstrances were vain; he was cruelly censured, yet he died in the Papal communion.
Dear Hirscher! The venerable man kissed me when I parted from him in 1851,260 and
gave me his blessing with a primitive spirit of Christian charity. I gratefully quote him here.</p>
<p>In Germany a passing stranger often sees the pious peasantry at Mass, singing with all
their hearts their beautiful German hymns. It misleads, however. They are not attending to
the Mass, but consoling themselves by spiritual songs, while it goes on without their assistance.
The bell rings: they adore the host, but that is all their relation to the worship of the
Christian liturgies. Hirscher loved their hymns, but bewailed the utter loss of their liturgic
communion, once common to the faithful.261</p>

<p>IV.
(Teachers of the Easterns, etc., p. 561.)</p>
<p>The apostle Thaddeus is called Addai in Syriac. Maris is said to have been one of the
seventy disciples, but his name is not on the list ascribed to Hippolytus. He was the first
bishop of the people now called “Nestorians,” but whom Dr. Badger262 prefers to call “the
Christians of Assyria.”</p>
<p>We have this liturgy in another form in Dr. Badger’s important work, Nestorians and
their Rituals. He selects that called “the Liturgy of Nestorius” from three which are in use
among the Assyrians, but criticises the translation of Renaudot as not entirely faultless. It
is selected by Dr. Badger because of its reputed Nestorianism; while Hammond gives us
what is here translated, in Renaudot’s Latin.263 We must bear in mind, that, since the Eph-

esine Council (a.d. 431), these Christians have been separated from the communion of
Eastern orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The Malabar Liturgy should be carefully compared with this by the student. A convenient
translation of it is to be found in Neale and Littledale. A most important fact, by the way,
is noted in their translation;264 viz., that in this Malabar “the invocation of the Holy Ghost,
contrary to the use of every other Oriental liturgy, preceded the words of institution;” that is
to say, in the work of the Portuguese revisers, a work from which Dr. Neale and his colleague
feel justified in making “a considerable alteration” as to the order of the prayers.</p>
<p>The words of institution are found in the Malabar, and suggest that they belong not less
to this Liturgy of the Assyrians, though, ex summa verecundia,265 they are omitted from
the transcript, as the Lord’s Prayer is omitted in the Clementine.</p>
<p>The normal form of this corrupted liturgy is credited with extreme antiquity by Dr.
Neale. To his learned and cogent reasoning on the subject the student should by all means
refer.266</p>

<p>V.
(For all the prophets and confessors, p. 565.)</p>
<p>These commemorations of the dead, it will be noted, are in behalf of the most glorious
apostles and saints, and for martyrs who go straight to glory. Obviously, as Usher has said,267
for whatever purpose, then, the departed were commemorated, it was not to change their
estate before the resurrection, much less to relieve them from purgatorial penalties. This
comes out in the “Liturgy of St. Chrysostom” (so called), where it is said: “We offer to Thee
this reasonable service for those who have fallen asleep in faith,…patriarchs, apostles,
evangelists, martyrs,…and every just one made perfect in the faith: especially our all-holy,
undefiled, most blessed Lady, Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary,” etc. But she, they tell us,
was assumed into glory, like Christ Himself, and reigns with Him as “Queen of Angels,” etc.
See Elucidation II. p. 569.</p>

<p>VI.
(The propitiatory blood, etc., p. 566.)</p>
<p>The peril of confounding the early use of this idea of propitiation with the mediæval
theory, which is quite another, is well pointed out and enforced by Burbidge.268 The prim-

itive writers and the ancient liturgies “do not regard the Eucharist as being itself a propitiatory
offering,” but it is the perpetual pleading of the blood of propitiation once offered. Thus St.
Chrysostom: “We do not offer another sacrifice, but always the same.” So far, his words
might be quoted to favour the Middle-Age doctrine; but he guards himself, and adds:269
“or, rather, we make a memorial of the sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The rhetoric of the liturgies and of the Fathers was unhappily made into the logic of the
Schoolmen, and hence the stupendous system of propitiatory Masses, with Masses for the
dead, and that traffic in Masses which so fearfully defiles the priesthood of Western Europe
and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America. In vain does the pious Hirscher
complain:270 “The rich, then, are the happy sinners in this respect: they can buy innumerable
Masses, and establish them in perpetuity; their privileges have no limit, and their advantages
over the poor extend through all eternity.” His book was put into the Index (Acts xvi. 19,
xix. 27), but it was never answered.</p>

<p>VII.
Let me now recur to Elucidation III. on p. 507, to which I would here add the
following from Bishop Williams, as there quoted:—</p>
<p>“In both the Mozarabic and the Gallican Liturgies there was an invocation as well as an
oblation. Irenæus271 says (and he, writing at Lyons, must have in mind the Gallican Liturgy),
‘The bread which is of the earth, having received the invocation of God, is no longer common
bread, but the Eucharist.’ The word translated ‘invocation’ is ἐπίκλησιν; and it is worthy of
notice that Basil and Cyril of Jerusalem use the same word in evidently the same technical
sense (Harvey’s Irenæus, vol. ii. pp. 205–207 and notes). In another passage Irenæus272
speaks even more distinctly: ‘We offer to God the bread and the cup of blessing, giving
thanks to Him for that He hath commanded the earth to bring forth these fruits for our
nourishment; and, having finished the offering, we invoke the Holy Spirit that He may exhibit
(or declare, ἀποφήνῃ) this sacrifice and bread the body of Christ, and the cup the blood
of Christ, that they who shall receive these antitypes may obtain remission of sins and
everlasting life’ (Harvey’s Irenæus, vol. ii. p. 502). This passage is a remarkable one. It proves
beyond question, that, in the time of Irenæus (d. a.d. 202 or 208), the Liturgy of Gaul contained
an invocation of the Holy Ghost following the oblation of the bread and cup.
Moreover, when we compare the words of Irenæus with those of the Clementine Liturgy,
their agreement is too clear and precise to be explained as a mere chance-matter. The liturgy

reads, ‘Send down Thy Holy Spirit on this sacrifice, the witness of the sufferings of the Lord
Jesus, that He may exhibit (ἀποφήνῃ) this bread, the body of Thy Christ, and this cup, the
blood of Thy Christ, that they who shall receive,’273 etc. Irenæus says as above, using the
same word (ἀποφήνῃ), a word which is found, it is believed, in no liturgy but the Clementine.”</p>
<p>Now I humbly suggest that Justin Martyr and Irenæus concur in giving us evidence that
the Clementine Liturgy is substantially that which was used in Rome and Gaul in their times.
The latter may have received it from Polycarp. The use of the Roman and the Greek churches
was uniform in his day, as may be inferred from the intercourse of Polycarp and Victor.274</p>

<p>Quindecemviri.: 504</p>
<p>Sed neque mulier virtutem pudicitiæ caperet, si peccare non posset. Nam quis mutum animal
pudicum esse dixerit, quod suscepto foe tu mari repugnat? Quod ideo facit, quia necesse
est in dolorem atque in periculum veniat, si admiserit. Nulla igitur laus est, non facere quod
facere non possis. Ideo autem pudicitia in homine laudatur, quia non naturalis est, sed voluntaria.
Servanda igitur fides ab utroque alteri est: immo exemplo continentia: docenda
uxor, ut se caste gerat. Iniquum est enim, ut id exigas, quod præ stare ipse non possis. Quæ
iniquitas effecit profecto, ut essent adulteria, foe minis ægre ferentibus præ stare se fidem
non exhibentibus mutuam charitatem. Denique nulla est tam perditi pudoris adultera, quæ
non hanc causam vitiis suis præ tendat; injuriam se peccando non facere, sed referre. Quod
optime Quintilianus expressit: Homo, inquit, neque alieni matrimonii abstinens, neque sui
custos, quæ inter se natura. connexa sunt. Nam neque maritus circa corrumpendas aliorum
conjuges occupatus potest vacare domesticæ sanctitati; et uxor, cum in tale incidit matrimonium,

<p>et Aristoteles sic fieri arbitrantur. Aiunt non tantum maribus inesse semen, verum etiam

et primum quidem cor hominis effingi, quod in eo sit et vita omnis et sapientia; denique
totum opus quadragesimo die consummari. Ex abortionibus hæ c fortasse collecta sunt. In

<p>Cavendum igitur, ne occasionem vitiis nostra intemperantia demus: sed assuescant invicem
mores duorum, et jugum paribus animis ferant. Nos ipsos in altero cogitemus. Nam fere in
hoc justitiæ summa consistit, ut non facias alteri, quidquid ipse ab altero pati nolis. Hæc
sunt quæ ad continentiam præ cipiuntur a Deo. Sed tamen ne quis divina præ cepta circumscribere
se putet posse, adduntur ilia, ut omnis calumnia, et occasio fraudis removeatur,
adulterum esse, qui a marito dimissam duxerit, et eum qui præ tercrimen adulterii uxorem
dimiserit, ut alteram ducat; dissociari enim corpus et distrahi Deus noluit. Præ terea non
tanturn adulterium esse vitandum, sed etiam cogitationem; ne quis aspiciat alienam, et animo
concupiscat: adulteram enim fieri mentem, si vel imaginem voluptatis sibi ipsa depinxerit.
Mens est enim profecto quæ peccat; quæ immoderata: libidinis fructum cogitatione complectitur;
in hac crimen est, in hac omne delictum. Nam etsi corpus nulla sit lobe maculatum,
non constat tamen pudicitiæ ratio, si animus incestus est; nec illibata castitas videri potest,
ubi conscientiam cupiditas inquinavit. Nec verb aliquis existimet, difficile esse fræ nos imponere
voluptati, eamque vagam et errantem castitatis pudicitiæ que limitibus includere,
cum propositum sit hominibus etiam vincere, ac plurimi beatam atque incorruptam corporis
integritatem retinuerint, multique sint, qui hoc coe lesti genere vitæ felicissime perfruantur.

Quod quidem Deus non ira fieri præ cepit, tanquam astringat, quia generari homines
oportet; sed tanquam sinat. Scit enim, quantam his affectibus imposuerit necessitatem. Si
quis hoc, inquit, facere potuerit, habebit eximiam incomparabilemque mercedem. Quod
continentiæ genus quasi fastigium est, omniumque consummatio virtutum. Ad quam si
quis eniti atque eluctari potuerit, hunc servum dominus, hunc discipulum magister agnoscet;
hic terrain triumphabit, hic erit consimilis Deo, qui virtutem Dei cepit. Hæc quidem difficilia
videntur; sed de eo loquimur, cui calcatis omnibus terrenis, iter in coelum paratur. Nam
quia virtus in Dei agnitione consistit, omnia gravia sunt, dum ignores; ubi cognoveris, facilia:

contra naturam contraque institutum Dei machinatus est: sic imbuit homines, et armavit

libidini suæ depopulandam foedandamque substraverint? Non potest hæc res pro
magnitudine sceleris enarrari. Nihil amplius istos appellare possum, quam implos et parricidas,
quibus non sufficit sexus a Deo datus, nisi eliare suum profane ac petulanter illudant.
Hæc tamen apud illos levia, et quasi honesta sunt. Quid dicam de iis, qui abominandam

non piget facere? et tamen dicendum est, quia fit. De istis loquor, quorum teterrima libido

nefas prosequar? Vincit officium linguæ sceleris magnitudo. Cum igitur libido hæc edat
opera, et hæc facinora designer, armandi adversus earn virtute maxima sumus. Quisquis
affectus illos frænare non potest, cohibeat eos intra præ scriptum legitimi tori, ut et illud,
quod avide expetat, consequatur, et tamen in peccatum non incidat. Nam quid sibi homines

a crimine adulterii solutus est. Sed divina lex ira duos in matrimonium, quod est in corpus
unum, pari jure conjungit, ut adulter habeatur, quisquis compagem corporis in diversa
distraxerit. Nec ob aliam cansam Deus, cam cæteras animantes suscepto foetu maribus repugnare

continentia reluctetur. Nec tanturn alienis, quæ attingere non licet, veriun etiam publicis
vulgatisque corporibus abstinendum, Deus præcepit; docetque nos, cum duo inter se corpora
fuerint copulata, unum corpus efficere. Ita qui se coeno immerserit, coeno sit oblitus necesse
est; et corpus quidem cito ablui potest: mens autem contagione impudici corporis inquinata
non potest, nisi et longo tempore, et multis bonis operibus, ab ea quæ inhæ serit colluvione
purgari. Oportet ergo sibi quemque proponere, duorum sexuum conjunctionem generandi
causa datam esse viventibus, eamque legera his affectibus positam, ut successionera parent.
Sicut autem dedit nobis oculos Deus, non ut spectemus, voluptatemque capiamus, sed ut
videamus propter eos actus, qui pertinent ad vitæ necessitatem, ita genitalem corporis
partem, quod nomen ipsum docet, nulla alia causa nisi efficiendæ sobolis accepimus. Huic
divinæ legi summa devotione parendum est. Sint omnes, qui se discipulos Dei profitebuntur,
ita morati et instituti, ut imperare sibi possint. Nam qui voluptatibus indulgent, qui libidini
obsequuntur, ii animam suam corpori mancipant, ad mortemque condemnant: quia se
corpori addixerunt, in quod habet mors potestatem. Unusquisque igitur, quantum potest,
formet se ad verecundiam, pudorem colat, castitatem conscientia et mente tueatur; nec
tantum legibus publicis pareat: sed sit supra omnes leges, qui legem Dei sequitur. Quibus :

<p>Similitudines autem in corporibus filiorum sic fieri putant. Cum semina inter se permixta
coalescunt, si virile superaverit, patri similem provenire, seu marem, seu foeminam; si
muliebre præ valuerit, progeniem cujusque sexus ad imaginem respondere maternam. Id
autem præ valet e duobus, quod fuerit uberius; alterum enim quodammodo amplectitur et
includit: hinc plerumque fled, ut unius tantum lineamenta præ tendat. Si vero æqua fuerit
ex pari semente permixtio, figuras quoque misceri, ut soboles illa communis aut neutrum
referre videatur, quia totum ex altero non habet; aut utrumque, quia partem de singulis
mutuata est. Nam in cor-poribus animalium videmus aut confundi parentum colores, ac
fieri tertium neutri generantium simile; aut utriusque sic exprimi, ut discoloribus membris
per omne corpus concors mixtura varietur. Dispares quoque naturæ hoc modo fieri
putantur. Cum forte in læ vam uteri partem masculinæ stirpis semen inciderit, marem
quidem gigni opinatio est; sed quia sit in foeminina parte conceptus, aliquid in se habere
foemineum, supra quam decus virile patiatur; vel formam insignem, vel nimium candorem,
vel corporis levitatem, vel artus delicatos, vel staturam brevem, vel vocem gracilem, vel animum
imbecillum, vel ex his plura. Item, si partem in dextram semen foeminini sexus influxerit,
foeminam quidem procreari; sed quoniam in masculina parte concepta sit, habere
in se aliquid virilita-tis, ultra quam sexus; ratio permittat; aut valida membra, aut immoderatam

quæ maxime coercenda est, quia maxime nocet. Cure excogitasset Deus duorum sexuum
rationero, attribuit iis, ut se invicem appeterent, et conjunctione gauderent. Itaque ardentissimam
cupiditatem cunctorum animantium corporibus admiscuit, ut in hos affectus avidissime
ruerent, eaque ratione propagari et multiplicari genera possent. Quæ cupiditas et
appetentia in homine vehementior et acrior invenitur; vel quia hominum multitudinem
voluit esse majorem, vel quoniam virtutem soli homini dedit, ut esset laus et gloria in coercendis
voluptatibus, et abstinentia sui. Seit ergo adversarius ille noster, quanta sit vis hujus
cupiditatis, quam quidam necessitatem dicere maluerunt; eamque a recto et bono, ad malum
et pravum transfert. Illicita enim desideria immittit, ut aliena contaminent, quibus habere
propria sine delicto licet. Objicit quippe oculis irritabiles formas, suggeritque fomenta, et
vitiis pabulum subministrat: tum intimis visceribus stimulos omnes conturbat et commovet,
et naturalem illum incitat atque inflammat ardorem, donee irretitum hominem implicatumque
decipiat. Ac ne quis esset, qui poenarum metu abstineret alieno, lupanaria quoque
constituit; et pudorem infelicium mulierum publicavit, ut ludibrio haberet tam eos qui faciunt,

<head>Apostolic Fathers: I Clement, II Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp,
Didache, Barnabas, The Shepherd of Hermas, The Martyrdom of
Polycarp, The Epistle of Dio by Kirsopp Lake</head>
<p>The Apostolic Fathers are a group of early Christian authors whose writings date back to
the middle of the first century. Included among the Apostolic Fathers are St. Clement of
Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, St. Polycarp of Smyrna, Didache, Barnabas of Alexandria, The
Shepherd of Hermas, and Diognetus. Though their writings are not included in the New
Testament, these Christian leaders are believed to have had contact with Jesus' twelve disciplines.
This collection of writings reveals the practices and theology of early Pauline
Christianity as it developed in churches across different cultures. In order to preserve the
authenticity of these writings, this version of Apostolic Fathers remains in the original Greek;
the book will be useful for pastors, scholars, and seminarians who are familiar with the
Greek language.

<head>NPNF-211. Sulpitius Severus, Vincent of Lerins, John Cassian by
Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers
are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating
texts from some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening
texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and
fruitful even today!
